The Jnode project 
=====


  this project holds a simple knowledge through the whole construction, which is :

* a big one comes from the ground, and simple grows up complexity.

i would not believe this several years ago before get to know about nodejs and 
javascript language, but once get to know it, i was immediately attracted. 

so what is the ultimate expect put on this Jnode proejct ? 
---
* a successful try of UI construct , which can make reference for projects in the future.
* one system, which i will call it **operating-system** , provides all functionality like file-management and http invite, and also, the all basic components required by a system-called thing.
