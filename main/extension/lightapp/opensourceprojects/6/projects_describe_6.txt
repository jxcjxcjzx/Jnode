 title : The f4k-curriculum Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>F4k curriculum provides a way of organising the teaching and learning of science and mathematics. It uses an open-ended  approach, mostly practical work and investigative projects. </p>

<p>The target age-group of students is young (mostly pre-adolescant) children, so long as they are literate. </p>

<p>Some projects will never be published as more than a very brief outline, nothing more than a heading for a brainstorming  session.  </p>

<p>Others will be developed much further: their starting point is a set of aims and objectives; to these team members can add background references, learning activities, worksheets, apparatus and prior skills needed, safety issues, assessments, mark-schemes, and the students can add raw data, fair-copy reports, feedback. </p>

<p>This is NOT about computer simulations. Almost all the projects start, as far as a student or group of students is concerned, with original work done in the laboratory or  field. This is the raw data. The computer is then used, with a software suite of open-source software suite that we recommend, to help in the &#39;write-up&#39;. The internet is used for communication and as a respository of data, and for instruction in the form of screencasts. </p>

<p>There is little original software in this project, apart from the XML schema and a plethora of XSLT. Mostly it is a matter of bringing together a whole raft of other material, and making it more suitable for youngsters. </p>

<p>we hope to tame: Firefox, Google Apps, Python, Skite, LaTeX, LyX, Gnumeric, Cocoon, Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus, Open office, subversion, Eclipse ...</p>

 summary : <p>The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is the science operations center for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; in orbit since 1990) and for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST; scheduled to be launched in 2013). STScI is located on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus in Baltimore, Maryland and was established in 1981 as a community-based science center that is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). Today, in addition to performing continuing science operations of HST and preparing for scientific exploration with JWST, STScI manages and operates the Multi-mission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST), the Data Management Center for the Kepler mission and a number of other activities benefiting from its expertise in and infrastructure for supporting the operations of space-based astronomical observatories.  The staff at STScI consists of scientists (mostly astronomers and astrophysicists), software engineers, data management and telescope operations personnel, education and public outreach experts, and administrative and business support personnel. There are approximately 100 Ph.D. scientists working at STScI, 15 of which are ESA staff who are on assignment to the HST project. The total STScI staff consists of about 350 people. </p>

<p>STScI operates its missions on behalf of NASA, the worldwide astronomy community, and the general public. The science operations activities directly serve the astronomy community, primarily in the form of HST (and eventually JWST) observations and grants, but also include distributing data from other NASA missions (e.g., Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, Galaxy Evolution Explorer) and ground-based sky surveys. The ground system development activities create and maintain the software systems needed to provide these services to the astronomy community. STScI&#39;s public outreach activities provide a wide range of information, on-line media, and programs for formal educators, planetariums and science museums, and the general public. STScI&#39;s award-winning public outreach websites receive millions of hits per month. STScI also serves as a source of guidance to NASA on a range of optical and UV space astrophysics issues. </p>

<p>The STScI staff interacts and communicates with the professional astronomy community through a number of channels, including participation at the bi-annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society, publication of quarterly STScI newsletters and the STScI website, hosting user committees and science working groups, and holding several scientific and technical symposia and workshops each year. These activities enable STScI to disseminate information to the telescope user community as well as enabling the STScI staff to maximize the scientific productivity of the facilities they operate by responding to the needs of the community and of NASA.</p>

 summary : <p>Asterisk Voicemail for iPhoneAsterisk Voicemail for iPhone allows you to check your voicemail messages on your Asterisk phone system from your iPhone (or iPod Touch). It has been suggested that I rename the software to something more generic, since the iPod Touch is also fully supported. Something like &quot;Asterisk Voicemail for Apple Touch&quot;. Thoughts? </p>

<p>It works similar to the native iPhone Visual Voicemail, allowing you to list messages, listen to messages, display caller-id information, delete messages, move messages, return calls and change voicemail settings all from your iPhone. </p>

<p>The technology behind it is Asterisk (The Open-Source VoIP PBX), PHP for the backend, Smarty and iUI for the frontend. </p>

<p>Before you downloadUnderstand what this software is. It is a PHP web-application which resides on your Asterisk server. Don&#39;t be confused into thinking that this is a native iPhone application. If you don&#39;t run or manage an Asterisk server, then this is not for you. </p>

<p>Project StatusThis software is at an Beta stage. Most features are complete. </p>

 title : The iphone-backup-decoder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Major UpdateA GUI version is availableI have written a Mac OS X GUI version of this tool.  It is available for download at my website.  The GUI app supersedes this script, and I will not be continuing to maintain this version.  Please download the new app, and let me know what you think.   </p>

<p>iTunes stores a backup of some of the iPhone files on your computer.  This script will extract these files so that you can view and edit them.  </p>

<p>The script does not currently support re-encoding. </p>

<p>Make a copy of your ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ and run the script against the *.mdbackup files.  The script will create a MobileSyncExport folder which will contain the extracted files. </p>

<p>Currently supports Mac OS X. Tested on Python 2.3.5 and upwards.  Tested with iPhone OS 2.1 / iTunes 8.0 backups. </p>

<p>The output is a folder full of plist and SQLite databases.  If that doesn&#39;t mean anything to you or you don&#39;t know how to use Terminal to run a python script, this script will not be of use to you.   </p>

<p>Thanks to Eric A Merrill for suggesting a fix for 1.1.4 and to joachimb for suggesting a patch.</p>
 title : The iphone-backup-slurper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewWhenever iTunes syncs with an iPhone, it creates a backup of the files on the device. This backup is stored in: </p>

<p>~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup </p>

<p>It can be interesting to look at these backups, but a bit of work is necessary to get access to them. I&#39;ve whipped up a quick and dirty application to display the most common cases, iPhone Backup Slurper. </p>

<p>mdbackup FilesThe files themselves are named with what appears to be a hex representation of a UUID with the extension &quot;mdbackup&quot;. One of these files corresponds to a single filesytem entry on the iPhone. The file is just a standard plist, with binary encoding. You can convert this to a text file using </p>

<p>plutil -convert  -o The plist contains the following keys: </p>

<p>Domain: The scope of the file. Options are &quot;HomeDomain&quot;, &quot;LibraryDomain&quot;, or a specific application bundleID. Path: The path within the domain where the file is stored on the iPhone. Data: The contents of the file. I assume that this is data-fork only, if the iPhone supports multiple forks. </p>

<p>The file can be any arbitrary kind of file, but in practice, there are only a few different types of files that developers seem to actually be saving in the filesystem. </p>

<p>The app reads in the plist, displays the metadata keys described above, and does some heuristics on the data to try to guess how to display it. The most common cases I found by browsing my own backup directory were: </p>

<p>text file plist saved as a string file binary plist image zip file sqlite 3 database completion dictionary </p>

<p>iPhone Backup Slurper will print any of these out to a descriptive file when it encounters them. If the backup contains an image, it will display the image. For a zip file, it will display the filenames embedded in the zip. It will dump the contents of an SQLite database. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are two pathological cases I found while playing with this that I couldn&#39;t figure out how to handle. First, there are some files that appear to be SQLite 3 databases &amp;ndash; the file begins with the string &quot;SQLite format 3&quot;. But the version of SQLite 3 included with Leopard 10.5.5 gawks when trying to read them. </p>

<p>Second are the audio files bundled with Tap Tap Revolution. The Quicktime APIs don&#39;t recognize them as valid m4a files. Maybe they&#39;re actually something different. </p>

<p>Manifest FilesThe backup directory also contains a plist named &quot;Manifest.plist&quot;. This is a manifest of all of the mdbackup files in the same directory. iPhone Backup Slurper can also display the contents of this file by choosing Open Manifest from the File menu. </p>

<p>The manifest contains the following key/value pairs: </p>

<p>AuthVersion: The current version of this file. AuthData: The string &quot;Forty Two&quot; encoded as hex without a null terminator. AuthSignature: The SHA1 signature of the &quot;Data&quot; key. Data: The actual manifest stored as a binary plist.   The manifest itself is just a listing of all of the applications on the phone, with the files for each, and a separate listing of each file&#39;s attributes. Specifically, these are the keys: Applications: A list of each application, keyed by the applications&#39; bundle identifiers. DeviceId: The device that this manifest is intended to be used with. Files: A list of each of the files in the backup directory, keyed by the file&#39;s UUID. Each entry contains filesystem attributes for the file and a DataHash to ensure data integrity. I don&#39;t know the hash algorithm used by the data hash, but I suspect it&#39;s something tricky that uses the &quot;Forty Two&quot; value mentioned above as a hash seed.   </p>

<p>ConclusionI hope iPhone Backup Slurper is useful to people or just fun for exploration! If nothing else, it&#39;s a good example of using a bunch of different APIs to parse different filetypes. Finally, I&#39;m indebted to OmniGroup for their useful OSLDatabaseController sqlite wrapper class.</p>

 title : The iphone-daliclock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a port of Dali Clock to the iPhone. </p>

<p>Dali Clock is a digital clock. When a digit changes, it &quot;melts&quot; into it new shape. The date is displayed when the screen is tapped. The clock also does funky psychedelic color cycling. </p>

<p>Update 3/9/2008I&#39;ve started work on migrating my port of Dali Clock to apple&#39;s official SDK, and JWZ has contacted me about merging the iPhone port back into the main Dali Clock distribution he maintains. There are some pretty big changes between the homebrew SDK and the official SDK, so I had to make some pretty big changes to how I was drawing to the screen. Right now it works in the simulator but it leaks memory like crazy. Hopefully by the time Mobile OSX 2.0 is released to the public, and the app store is online, you&#39;ll be able to download a nice version of daliclock from the app store for free :) </p>

<p>If you feel like helping out, work on the official SDK version is happening in the apple-sdk branch in subversion. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Update 11/22/2007Dali Clock can now be downloaded and installed via installer.app! If you have the &quot;Community sources&quot; package installed, you will find Dali Clock in the &quot;utilities&quot; section. Share and enjoy! </p>

 title : The iphone-xbmc-controller Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>iphone-xbmc-controller is a native application for control of Xbox Media Center (XBMC) using the iPhone or iPod Touch.   </p>

<p>It currently works with any jailbroken iPhone or iPod Touch.  I hope to eventually add this to the iTunes app store, but this will require me to buy a Mac and port to the official SDK.  Apparently the SDK only supports a subset of the UIKit classes I&#39;m currently using, so this could be a step backwards usability-wise. </p>

<p>Update 8/4/08 I&#39;ve just gotten the app to build and work on firmware version 2.0, using Jay Freeman&#39;s iphone-gcc tools available via Cydia.  I&#39;ve set up a Cydia repository at http://home.austin.rr.com/jsavage/iphone/Cydia for your installation convenience.   The current version is 0.2.1-1. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to fully test everything out in the 2.0 FW yet, so report any issues you find at http://code.google.com/p/iphone-xbmc-controller/issues/list </p>

<p>Update 7/30/08 I&#39;ve made some progress on the application recently, adding the &quot;Now playing&quot; view and the &quot;Media Queue&quot; view.   There still are a few &quot;nice to haves&quot; missing but the application is pretty useful at this point.   There is a new binary based on svn rev 24 in the featured downloads.   I also have an Installer.app repository hosted at this site.  Just add http://iphone-xbmc-controller.googlecode.com/files/repo-current.xml to your Installer.app sources. </p>

 title : The iphonedebug Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThe iPhone Debug Consle is meant to give greater visibility and interactivity on your iPhone/iPod Touch while doing development. I grew frustrated having to go through the &quot;include console.log statement then reload&quot; method of debugging. I wanted something similar to Firebug&#39;s fantastic console and debugger. </p>

<p>In trying to find something that would fit my needs, I came across Joe Hewitt&#39;s iPhone/Firebug integration, but I wanted something more robust and that worked without firebug and requiring &quot;console.log&quot; in the desktop browser. Since the COMET support in Jetty is quite good, and given that I&#39;m a Java programmer, not a Python one, I decided to just write my own and offer it up to the community. I think it will be helpful to those getting very frustrated with debugging your Ajax apps on the iPhone/iPod Touch. </p>

<p>You can download the latest version, which is considered an Alpha release (even though it&#39;s fairly stable). Please log any issues you encounter on the project&#39;s Issues page. </p>

<p>DownloadiPhoneDebugConsole-0.4a-bin.zip </p>

<p>ScreenshotsScreenshots of ipd in action. </p>

<p>Installation1) Unzip the binary package to some location on your hard drive. That&#39;s such an obvious step I&#39;ve always wondered why in the world every OpenSource project includes a bullet similar to this. But there it is. For the sake of completeness, I guess. </p>

<p>2) Open a command line and &quot;cd&quot; into the installation directory (e.g. /home/myuser/iPhoneDebugConsole-0.3a). </p>

<p>3) I haven&#39;t got Maven to preserve the executable bit on the &quot;ipd.sh&quot; batch file yet (I&#39;m a relative newcomer to Maven), so for the meantime, you&#39;ll need to: (FIXED in 0.4a...you can safely ignore this step now) </p>

<p>chmod +x ipd.sh        4) Then start the console server: </p>

<p>./ipd.shOPTIONAL: There is an option you can pass to the ipd console to tell it the port on which you want the COMET server to run. By default it uses 8170. To change it, give ipd.sh the &quot;-P&quot; parameter like so: </p>

<p>./ipd.sh -P 88885) Until browsers support cross-domain XHR in a transparent way, you&#39;ll need to have the client JavaScript that defines the &quot;ipd.log&quot; function (and the supporting libraries) placed inside the domain you want to  access from your iPhone/iPod Touch. I&#39;m really sorry about this, but that&#39;s just the breaks at the moment. You might already being using dojo v1.1. If so, then you only need two JavaScript files. If not, then you have to have the ipd-specific client JavaScript files AND the dojo files. A full distribution is included because, as ipd matures, I plan to create widgets for the console application using dijit.         </p>

<p>a) To install the ipd files and libraries in Apache, you can either put the following in your httpd.conf file, or in an .htaccess file: </p>

<p>Alias /ipd/jslib &quot;/home/myuser/iPhoneDebugConsole-0.1/jslib&quot;
<br/>Alias /ipd &quot;/home/myuser/iPhoneDebugConsole-0.1/client&quot;Or you could copy the client and jslib directories into your web root at whatever location you desire (just keep jslib/ under wherever you put the ipd.js and _ipd.js). Where the ipd.js file lives is not that important because you&#39;re going to tell it what baseUrl to use when you add the script tag to your document. 
<br/>           6) To start using the ipd debug console in your web application, you&#39;ll need to tell ipd where you&#39;ve installed the JavaScript files and then include a script tag that loads a bootstrap file (which loads the actual library files it needs in a script.aculo.us-like way).         Somewhere in the head of your document, add two script tags similar to the following: </p>

<p>ipdConfig = {
<br/>  baseUrl: &#39;/ipd/&#39;, // trailing slash!
<br/>  consoleBaseUrl: &#39;http://192.168.10.1:8170/&#39; // trailing slash!
<br/>}</p>

<p>YOU MUST HAVE A TRAILING SLASH! (at least until I&#39;ve add more checking to account for leaving it off...) </p>

<p>A little explanation: </p>

<p>The configuration parameter ipdConfig.baseUrl should be the same as the Alias you put in your Apache configuration file. In this case, I&#39;m using &quot;/ipd/&quot;.     </p>

<p>The configuration parameter ipdConfig.consoleBaseUrl should point to the location of the ipd console server you started earlier.  </p>

<p>GOTCHA: The hostname and port should be accessible from your iPhone/iPod Touch. This seems like a no-brainer, but trust me, it&#39;s easy to forget and leave it at localhost. Since your console server IS NOT running on your iPhone, that ain&#39;t gonna work. :) </p>

<p>7) Pull up the url of your ipd console in a browser (tested browsers include Firefox, Safari 3.1, and IE 7...if you use something else, I&#39;d be interested to hear your success or failure). In this case, it is JUST FINE to use &quot;localhost&quot;. </p>

<p>http://localhost:81708) The console will appear on your screen and it should note that the console service has been started. </p>

<p>9) Pull up your page (in which you&#39;ve inserted the appropriate code to use the &quot;ipd.log&quot; function, as mentioned in #6) on your iPhone or iPod Touch. On the console screen, it should print out a message that a new client has connected. Every log message is preceded by a USER_AGENT string to help keep things straight. If you see a &quot;New client connected from...&quot; message, then everything is ready to go. </p>

<p>10) To start using it, just insert calls to ipd.log( object || string ) in your JavaScript. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: You can also send things to the iPhone/iPod Touch to be eval&#39;d there. The text box at the bottom of the console screen is very similar to Firebug&#39;s JavaScript console. Type in a command, or even just a variable name, and the results will be logged back to your remote console. You can do things like: </p>

<p>dojo.byId(&quot;results&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;my html&quot;BE PAITIENT! It might take a second or more to make the round-trip between your desktop and the mobile device.                    After a slight delay (depending on your latency--whether you&#39;re on EDGE or WiFi), you&#39;ll see that the &quot;results&quot; DIV has been updated. You can assign variables: </p>

<p>results = dojo.byId(&quot;results&quot;)And then access them later: </p>

<p>results.style.displayYou don&#39;t need to call &quot;ipd.log(results.style.display)&quot;, as ipd is smart enough to try and log everything it can back to your remote console. If &quot;eval&quot; returns an object, then it will get logged back to your remote console.                    The command box also supports basic UP and DOWN arrow command history retrieval.                    </p>

<p>INSTALLATION (source)ipd uses Maven to build the source code and the distribution files. Command-line version goes something like this: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://iphonedebug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ iphonedebug-read-onlythen &quot;cd&quot; into that directory and do: </p>

<p>mvn assembly:assemblyThis will compile and build distribution packages in the &quot;target/&quot; directory.      If you use eclipse and have the Maven plugin installed, then just checkout the source code and import the project into your workspace (there is a .project file already in the root).      </p>

<br/>      
<br/> REQUIREMENTS:
<br/> 
<br/>    Java 1.5 or above.
<br/>    
<br/>    Bash (for the startup script only). Windows users will need to either use 
<br/>    Cygwin tools (which include bash), wait for me to release a batch file that 
<br/>    does what the bash script does, or write one yourself. Contributions in this 
<br/>    area are MORE THAN WELCOME.
<br/>    
<br/>    ipd is written in Java, so it support the full range of platforms on which
<br/>    Java can run. The startup script, however, is a BASH script. That means the
<br/>    STARTUP SCRIPT will only work on UNIX-like platforms (BSDs, Linux, Solaris, 
<br/>    Mac OS X, etc...). 
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/> LICENSING:
<br/> 
<br/>    1) ipd (iPhone Debug Console) is released under the GNU GPL version 3.

<br/>       
<br/>    3) No sense in re-inventing the wheel. ipd uses the great COMETD support
<br/>       in the dojo toolkit version 1.1. Dojo is GPL-licensed software and you
<br/>       can find out more from their website:

<br/>       
<br/>INSTALLATION (binary package):</p>

<br/>       ./ipd.sh
<br/>

<br/>                  to your remote console. If &quot;eval&quot; returns an object, then
<br/>                  it will get logged back to your remote console.
<br/>                  
<br/>                  The command box also supports basic UP and DOWN arrow 
<br/>                  command history retrieval.
<br/>                  
<br/>INSTALLATION (source):</p>

<p>    ipd uses Maven to build the source code and the distribution files. Command-
<br/>    line version goes something like this:
<br/>    
<br/>    svn checkout http://iphonedebug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ iphonedebug-read-only</p>

<p>    then &quot;cd&quot; into that directory and do:
<br/>    
<br/>    mvn assembly:assembly
<br/>    
<br/>    This will compile and build distribution packages in the &quot;target/&quot; 
<br/>    directory.
<br/>    
<br/>    If you use eclipse and have the Maven plugin installed, then just checkout
<br/>    the source code and import the project into your workspace (there is a
<br/>    .project file already in the root).
<br/>    
<br/>                  
<br/>STUFF DOESN&#39;T SHOW UP!:</p>

<p>    This might happen if things get out-of-sync between the mobile client, the
<br/>    COMET server, and the desktop console. Just refresh the page on your 
<br/>    desktop browser and do the same on your iPhone/iPod Touch. If that doesn&#39;t
<br/>    fix it, try issuing a CTRL-C inside the command prompt you used to start
<br/>    ipd, restart it, then refresh the page in both the console and client.
<br/>    
<br/>    IMPORTANT: It&#39;s best to refresh the DESKTOP CONSOLE first, then the client.
<br/>               Usually, under normal conditions, it doesn&#39;t really matter. The
<br/>               dojo COMETD implementation is smart enough to reconnect after
<br/>               the server has gone away and come back, so reloading may not even
<br/>               be needed in a lot of cases.
<br/>               
<br/>               
<br/>I STILL HAVE ISSUES:</p>

<p>    This is ALPHA software. It should work fine in most cases, but it might
<br/>    break at odd times and for no apparent reason. If you can tell what&#39;s going
<br/>    on, then please consider including your suspicions in your bug report.

 title : The mythtv-for-iphone Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MythTV for iPhone allows you to watch your TV shows on your MythTV DVR on your iPhone (or iPod Touch). It has been suggested that I rename the software to something more generic, since the iPod Touch is also fully supported. Something like &quot;MythTV for Apple Touch&quot;, or &quot;MythTVStream&quot;. Thoughts? </p>

<p>The software allows you to browse your recorded shows, and look at show details. You can stream any recorded show to the iPhone (or iPod Touch) wirelessly. </p>

<p>The technology behind it is MythTV (The Open-Source DVR), PHP for the backend, Smarty and iUI for the frontend.  </p>

<p>Update:2008-05-16 - I just did a fresh install of myth for iphone on a fresh ubuntu 8.04 box. I found a lot of changes that I need to update in the install guide when possible. Also like i said below, I&#39;m going to include smarty directories and update i_settings.php to have all the correct options to work on the ubuntu system. </p>

<p>2008-05-10 - Released version 0.04. I&#39;m considering including the smarty directory folders into the project which should make setup much easier. I think getting smarty set up is confusing for a lot of people. This will be included on version 0.05 which should come out next week. Also, I want to get the conversion script to tie into mythweb or somehow trigger the &quot;Convert to iPod&quot; background job in MythTV. Right now, the software just calls the conversion script manually. Lame. If we get it creating the background job in mythtv, then it will queue properly. </p>

<p>2008-05-09 - Updated my servers to Ubuntu 8.04 and having issues with the mythipod.sh conversion script. aac codec error. Once I work through this I will polish up a new version .04 and release to Google Code - Adding Medibuntu repositories to my Ubuntu install fixed this problem!</p>

 title : The quake3-iphone Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A port of Quake III Arena to the iPhone. </p>

<p>Project StatusAnd we&#39;re back!  The port is back in business with the iPhone 2.0 SDK.  Unfortunately it is not in a state yet where it can be distributed via the App Store, mostly because there is no good way to deploy the game files onto the phone&#39;s file-system.  Help with this would be appreciated.  Contact sethk@meowfishies.com for more details. </p>

<p>The input system is in somewhat of a state of flux while we try out different ideas.  See the section Input System below for details. </p>

<p>To build this application you will need a copy of the iPhone SDK, and to deploy it to a device you will need a developer&#39;s certificate.  See the Building page for details. </p>

<p>Input SystemCurrently the input system employs the accelerometer for movement and the touch interface for camera angle.   </p>

<p>Tilting the device forward and backwards will move the player forwards or backwards.  The neutral position is about 35º away from perpendicular, with the top of the screen tilted away from the viewer.  Rolling the device like a steering wheel will strafe in either direction.  There is a dead zone in the center, to avoid having the player constantly move. </p>

<p>Dragging a single finger across the screen will mouse-look, and tapping a second finger while holding the first one down will attack.  These methods of input can be bound to different actions using the default.cfg included in the project Resources. </p>

<p>For more information on customizing the input system, see the Input System Tweaking page. </p>

<p>ContributingThe Quake 3 iPhone project needs your help!  There are many things to do, from implementing features to fixing bugs and even non-coding tasks such as performance tweaking and testing.

 summary : <p>This project contains a collection of Ant tasks which help you integrate haXe with Ant. </p>

<p>Tested and working on Ant 1.7.0, 1.7.1 </p>

<p>InstallationTo install anthx, use: haxelib install anthx </p>

<p>Declare anthx TasksTo declare all anthx tasks within Ant so that you can use it in your Ant build files, place the following inside the project element of your Ant build file: </p>

<p>Note the path to Ant HX This must be the path to AntHX in your haxelib folder. Type haxelib path anthx to retrieve this. </p>

<p>For example, on my install the declaration looks like this: </p>

<p>UseOnce you have declared the tasks as above, you can use them like any other Ant task. </p>

<p>TaskshaxeEnv - Set global haxe paths for all anthx tasks. haxeEmbed - Executes haxe as script within an ant buildfile. haxe - Generically call haxe. neko - Run a neko file. haxelib - Run haxelib. getHaxelibPath - Return the path to a haxelib library. haxe2neko - Compile .hx files to a Neko file. haxe2swf - Compile .hx files to a Flash .swf file. haxe2js - Compile .hx files to a Javascript file. haxe2as3 - Compile .hx files to Actionscript 3 files. haxe2php - Compile .hx files to PHP files. haxe2cpp - Compile .hx files to C++ files. Paths to haXe and nekoBy default, the tasks here try to call haXe and neko within the current environment i.e. they assume that haXe and neko will run from the command line and all the appropriate environment variables are set. </p>

<p>You can override these using the haxeEnv task. </p>

<p>ChangelogVersion 0.7Added dependency checking (thanks to Gábor Szuromi) and forceRebuild/cacheFolder attributes. Fixed &amp;nbsp;issue 1&amp;nbsp; (classpaths with spaces) Added if= and unless= attributes to haxe-based tasks (again, thanks to Gábor). Added haxe2cpp Version 0.6Fix to NEKOPATH when executing haxeEmbed Version 0.5Fix to getHaxelibPath (due to changes in haxelib) Version 0.5Fix to getHaxelibPath (due to changes in haxelib) Version 0.4Updated to be compatible with haXe 2.0 Added haxe2php Version 0.3Now includes haxeEnv, haxe, neko, haxelib, getHaxelibPath, haxe2neko, haxe2swf, haxe2js, haxe2as3 Renamed anthx task to haxeEmbed.</p>

 title : The as3djvu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Flex/ActionScript DjVu Rendering Library (as3djvu)as3djvu is a library supporting decoding and rendering of DjVu files in ActionScript 3 and Flex based projects. DjVu is an excellent compression method for scanned documents which generally outperforms PDF and JPEG formats. </p>

<p>It is a port of JavaDjVu available here. </p>

<p>DetailsThe library includes support for </p>

<p>Decoding and rendering DjVu bitonal, grayscale and full color images Decoding IW44 and JB2 compressions Decodes directly from a remote URL source </p>

<p>StatusNOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY  </p>

<p>Rendered images are severely distorted, if rendered at all. Need to break decoding into a more asycnhronous process in order to avoid the 15 second  processing timeout limitation in Flash Player 9. </p>

<p>The current problems with the library are: </p>

<p>Variable typing. The java code relies on specific properties of the java variable types which do not always map exactly to ActionScript. At some point, I suspect variables are loosing precision which is causing the distortions. Flash Player timeout. FP9 is single threaded. The decompression process is slow on FP9 and can exceed the 15 second timeout. If the decompression is broken into smaller chunks and executed asycnhronously with a AS3 Timer, this limit can be worked around. </p>

<p>On the positive side,  </p>

<p>The code compiles with no errors.  The code is clean. Flash Player 10. Hopefully full GPU support in FP10 will allow for faster render times. </p>

<p>GoalsProvide component necessary for a fully Flex/Flash based DjVu viewer to make millions of pages of DjVu encoded documents available to web users without downloading a plugin. Help NeededIt would be really useful for someone with a better understanding of DjVu internals, or at least an ability to understand the DjVu whitepapers, to review the internals of the codec. Also, some expertise regarding optimizing/accelerating AS3 would be useful, too.</p>

 title : The cal3d-actionscript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a quick and dirty port of the Cal3D skeletal animation library I put together over winter break (originally in C++.) This is very much a work-in-progress. Part of the motivation of this is purely academic; I am aware that the excellent papervision3D team is working on skeletal animation support via Collada models. Speed wise this leaves much to be desired; hopefully it can be improved in future revisions. </p>

<p>The library makes use of Polygonal Labs Data Structures, available at: http://lab.polygonal.de/ds/ </p>

<p>The cal3D library itself is 3D engine agnostic; the Cally demo uses papervision3D to  display all models. </p>

<p>Currently the library only supports XML files. </p>

 title : The chumbydevelop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A template for FlashDevelop to easy Chumby widget development, and a set of mini components for FlashLite 3 </p>

<p>The template configures a few things: </p>

<p>Setup the Flash movie to Flash8 320x240 12fps Creates an application class with a &quot;main&quot; that gets executed when the movie is loaded Creates a &quot;util&quot; package with a few utility classes and components: UI : colors, basic graphic primitives, TextField utilities Menu : a very basic (and very ugly) menu system BarChart : a bar chart component HorizontalMeter : an horizontal &quot;battery meter&quot; VerticalMeter : a vertical &quot;battery meter&quot; Chumby : utility functions to access the Chumby&#39;s hardware </p>

<p>One day I&#39;ll write better documentation, but basically all you need to do is install FlashDevelop 3 and then copy the folder 03 ActionScript 2 - Chumby in C:\Documents and Settings\\Local Settings\Application Data\FlashDevelop\Templates\ProjectTemplates </p>

<p>If the template would come preinstalled with FD it would be in C:\Program Files\FlashDevelop\FirstRun\Templates\ProjectTemplates, but I don&#39;t know if there is a way to tell FlashDevelop to re-scan the source template folders. </p>

<p>Note that in later versions of FlashDevelop the default AS2 project template seems to have moved here: C:\Program Files\FlashDevelop\Projects\220 ActionScript 2 - AS2 Project </p>

<p>So, you can try to copy the &quot;03...&quot; folder as &quot;330 ActionScript 2 - Chumby&quot; (or some number that doesn&#39;t exist). </p>

<p>Once you have the template, run FlashDevelop, select &quot;New Project&quot; and you should see &quot;Chumby&quot; in the list of templates for ActionScript 2. Select it, give a name to the folder and the project and go. </p>

<p>Build the project and test it, it should display a text message on a blue background. If that works, just go ahead and build the real app. </p>

<p>Note: I chose to copy all the &quot;util&quot; files (UI, Chumby and widgets) into each project. It makes everything easy. Mtasc is smart enough to only compile the files you use so extra sources don&#39;t make your app any bigger. And you can always remove the files you know you will not be using.</p>

 title : The dunelox Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Dunelox is a library of components and utilities to implement Flex applications designed around Conversations.  </p>

<p>Conversation objects are responsible for the flow of interactions between the user, the application context and services. Conversations are started from a View component in response to an user event such as a button click. A Conversation typically reads and writes objects to a shared Application Context, may interact with the user through Dialogs and may call remote Services to get and update Business objects. </p>

<p>Conversations should not dependent on the View that uses them. It is a self-contained (testable!) class that implements the flow by calling Services and Dialogs that in return callback to the Conversation after completion.  </p>

<p>Because of this separation, Conversations be used anywhere in your application, are better reusable and can even be combined (one conversation starting another). </p>

<p>To support the implementation of this pattern, several classes are available in this library that are used to create your own Conversation subclasses, work with Dialogs, access the shared Application Context and use Service clients (or sometimes called Controllers or Delegates). </p>

<p>See below an overview of the architecture in which a sequence of actions is seen. </p>

 title : The flash-validators Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>These libraries include sample code for performing basic data validation.  They are similar to the Flex 3 SDK validators and they can be used within Flex or Flash Professional SWF files.  Included within the package are basic data validation methods such as determining if a string contains only alphanumeric characters.  The basic methods are then leveraged to validate more complex concepts such as zip codes, credit card numbers and URLs.  The sample framework provided within these classes is basic but should be extensible to fit the needs of various implementations.  It is expected that these raw classes will be reviewed and customized before being implemented within a particular environment. </p>

 title : The flashx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FlashXCore - 10% Math - 40% Graphics - 15% Network - 0% Input - 5% Content - 5% GUI - 0% FlashX is an advanced API for Adobe Flash written in ActionScript (currently AS3). </p>

<p>Unlike other Flash graphics libraries, FlashX is easy to use, and easy to improve. FlashX&#39;s structure is well thought out to be powerful, scalable, extensible, and compact, while maintaining readability. FlashX provides a lot of shortcuts and shorthand. FlashX tries not to rely on certain parts of the standard Flash API. The standard API vectors, matrices, keys, transformations, colors, etc. are all limited and drawing API rectangles, triangles, circles, lines, curves, etc. are all quite slow. Due to this, FlashX structure and syntax does not conform to the same conventions as most ActionScript code. This has the advantage of easily porting FlashX applications to new versions of ActionScript, as well as being similar to most OpenGL/DirectX graphics libraries. FlashX is grouped according to the Flash Player version, not the ActionScript version. Many features are only available and/or change based on the player version, not the language version. The player version automatically implies the language version since that itself is a feature. </p>

<p>FlashX is designed similar to XNA, DirectX, OpenGL, and OGRE. The syntax, concepts, and terminology are minor, making FlashX very easy to learn. </p>

<p>Flash SWF files can be generated from scratch using only the code supplied with this project, in which case your code does all the drawing, loading of images, etc. purely in Java. In addition, you can import the generated ActionScript into an existing SWF file that already contains resources. </p>

<p>This project includes these components: </p>

<p>Patches to the current SVN trunk of GWT that add support for an &quot;-actionscript2&quot; flag which causes GWT to output ECMAscript which is compliant with ActionScript 2.0, and pre-built JARs of same. A GWT module containing Java &quot;wrapper&quot; classes for the various native objects provided by the Flash player (work in progress). Examples showing how to build an animated SWF file using only Java source files compiled via GWT into ActionScript, and then compiled into a SWF file using MTASC. </p>

 summary : <p>Abstract </p>

<p>JSF Flex goal is to provide users capability in creating standard Flex components as JSF components {note dynamic charts and some other components are not part of standard Flex components}. So users would create the components as normal JSF components and the project will create the necessary MXML, SWC, SWF files and etcetera and link the values of the components back to the managed beans using JSON+Javascript and Actionscript. {standard Flex components have been open sourced through MPL license}. Also MXML_BASIC renderKitId allows utilizing other renderKits within the same view {i.e. HTML_BASIC}, allowing mix of JSF Flex components and other components such as standard HTML components. If you are curious of how the code is implemented, you can check out the following Wiki page which contains a brief overview : JSFFlexProcess. There exists various configuration fields that can be set within web.xml, but one noteworthy field is com.googlecode.jsfFlex.MODE which must be set to productionMode after creating SWF, SWC, and etcetera files in debugMode. </p>

<p>Following is a Wiki page containing info of JSF Flex project&#39;s Maven repo which has been created on April 18th, 2009 : JsfFlexMavenRepo. </p>

<p>The project aim is to support the following JSF implementations {bold faced are currently supported} : </p>

<p>MyFaces  1.2  2.0 Mojarra  1.2  2.0 </p>

<p>Quick Start </p>

<p>Following Wiki page contains info in importing the example WAR file and adding the project&#39;s Jar artifacts to a new Dynamic Web Project =&gt; QuickStart. </p>

<p>Since following information is so critical, it is being duplicated within the home page. When one is finished tweaking of creating the components/tags, one MUST change the com.googlecode.jsfFlex.MODE field within web.xml to productionMode to avoid the cost of creating preMxml, Mxml, Swf, and etceteras. Also one should copy all the system generated directories under Webcontent/swf/* to their corresponding directory within the Workspace during the move to higher env {since the system uses servContext.getRealPath(&quot;&quot;) as the root directory of preMxml, MXML, and SWF directory and} </p>

<p>Tomcat on default for example flushes it out to their cache directory under metadata i.e. C:\OpenSource\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\wtpwebapps\jsf-flex-examples JBoss on default for example flushes it out to their temp directory i.e. C:\Program Files\jboss-4.2.3.GA\server\default\tmp\deploy\tmp46689jsf-flex-examples.war  </p>

<p>Roadmap </p>

<p>Please refer to the following wiki page for information regarding what is planed for support within release 1.1 BETA =&gt; RoadMap. </p>

<p>Release Info </p>

<p>Recent changes for current Download artifact 1.0.1 BETA are : </p>

<p>This release has been made, so that focus can be spent on JSF 2.0 integration {which will provide easier + more friendly asynchronous communication} Change from usage of Qdox Javadoc to Annotation Code written in JDK 5.0 Support of Flex version 3.4 {i.e. DateChooser component and locale support according to the change needed of copyLocale execution for Flex version 3.x} Capability to submit the form data using mxmlButton or mxmlLinkButton tags Tweaking of performance { usage of Executors in some of the tasks to possibly assist in creation of multiple SWF + locale; however swc + swf creation is dependent upon Flex SDK } Capability in creating components outside of JSF Flex by providing the component name + attributes as tag attributes. Note the statement of &quot;components outside of JSF-Flex&quot; is targeted for any standard components that hasn&#39;t been placed as tags and etcetera within the project. However, the thought of integration with custom components was originally considered and for that reason there exists capability in setting sourcePath value within mxmlApplication tag {should be a single String deliminated with a space {will be changed to a List or an Array in the future}}. So hopefully, by setting the sourcePath to the absolute path of where the custom Actionscript file exists at, one should be able to utilize custom components outside of standard flex components {in similar manner the project&#39;s custom Actionscript files are integrated as part of a SWC file creation}. In the future release, this functionality will be tested using custom components as well as providing data binding to the fields of the custom component for data preservation. Thanks to onku for the question regarding the statement! One thing to note is the size of the download artifacts. Since Flex SDK now comes packaged with Air tools to allow creation of Air applications for Flex components, the size of flexSDK has been increased rather largely {that&#39;s the reason the first hit to any .xhtml or .jsf page will take a bit of time, but afterward the time should be relatively similar when hitting additional pages to create SWF, SWC, and etcetera within debugMode. please note that when one is done, one should change the configuration to productionMode to see it&#39;s actual performance}. There exists two reasons of why Air library hasn&#39;t been ripped out of flexSDK that is downloaded with the Jars :  First is for safety, meaning it is better to leave them in then to find out later that one needs certain Jars that has been removed Second is a possible investigation of creation of Air. Strong emphasis on possible. </p>

<p>For the next major Beta artifact 1.1 BETA release there will be support for : </p>

<p>Support of JSF 2.0 Support of latest,stable Flex version Capability of using MethodExpression for additional components. Additional functionality such as the current DataGrid component where there will be further interweaving of JSF/Java + ActionScript content.  Fixes found in additional testing. Clean up of code and additional functionality when thought of. </p>

<p>Meritocracy </p>

<p>The projects plans to do everything possible to encourage an environment that supports a meritocracy. Meaning any developer/member who has contributed dearly to the project and knows of the project&#39;s design will be promoted to an owner status. </p>

<p>Rationale </p>

<p>With the Web 2.0 technology flourishing within the web world, this would be a great opportunity in creating a project and bridging technologies such as Adobe Flex with JSF. </p>

<p>Specifically the project will provide : </p>

<p>Easy creation of standard Flex applications while preserving the ease of databinding to legacy systems through JSF An alternative to purchasing Flexbuilder when creating simple Flex applications</p>
 summary : <p>Highly customizable and interactive Eclipse plug-in to view log files. </p>

 summary : <p>Project Has MovedThis project has been moved to github.  This repository will remain for the time being, however. </p>

<p>LHASA: Layout Handler for ActionScript ApplicationsThis project aims to create a simple and powerful box model style layout handling system written in ActionScript.  The target audience is developers that would like to use a similar set of layout tools that Flex has but without the entire Flex framework. </p>

<p>Ideally it would be great to see the library expand to include basic UI element building blocks such as lists, buttons, etc. which delegate their styling/drawing to separate classes to keep the library uncluttered.  More detail can be found in the RoadMap. </p>

<p>NewsAugust 16, 2008Version 0.2.1 is released.  After a fair bit of use, I grappled with issues regarding elements not fully updating.  Usually elements that required several update steps would not always have their later RENDER events caught and thus would not update.  I later confirmed my suspicions when I found an older but obviously still relevant post on a forum about this.  For this release I have converted it to use the ENTER_FRAME event which makes things slightly less optimal performance-wise but I believe it should be negligible. </p>

<p>May 21, 2008Version 0.2 is released.  This version contains generated documentation by ASDOC and some small changes to the code-base.  This release contains some changes that will conflict with use of 0.1 though they should be minor. </p>

<p>May 19, 2008The beginnings of the revisted structure has been commited to the trunk.  r15 should serve as the basis for progress on this project.</p>

 title : The syntax2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Once Actionscript 3 came out, I dug right into it and had no problem making the migration from 2. My only complaints were the extremely long syntax, level management, and having to convert AS2 code to AS3. Over the year I have gradually created classes that bring the syntax back to 2.0, without even realizing. This includes the depth control, automatic mouse and event attachments, Stage, and more. </p>

<p>• You can write in AS2 or AS3 simultaneously. </p>

<p>• Convert Flash 8 files to 9 easier. </p>

<p>• Code as fast as you did in AS2 (My fave) </p>

<p>• Eliminates the learning curve form AS2 to AS3. I know many Flash designers that are descent with AS2 and can&#39;t seem to make the migration. This will keep them moving with the times, and help them to learn AS3 and its unforgiving error handling goodness.</p>

 title : The egg-robotics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project AbstractIn problems such as area exploration or search &amp; rescue, a multi-robot system often offer obvious advantages over a single-agent system due to its ability to divide a large, complex mission into smaller, simpler tasks, which can then be carried out by distributed agents often without sophisticated sensors or actuators. In these multi-agent robotic systems, however, the main challenge lies in the problem of combining local rules for individual agents to form global behaviors as a group in a predefined and stable manner. Previous works on Motion Description Languages (MDLs) 123 and Communication and Control Languages (CCLs) 4 attempted to specify robot tasks in a formal environment and focus on the individual dynamics, although it has been seen that this approach is not appealing from a networked point of view as they do not account for the local network topology associated with each robot. Graph Grammars, introduced by Klavins, Ghrist, and Lipsky 5, provides a natural tool for characterizing local interactions and control laws by explicitly focusing on combinatorial interaction rules rather than agent dynamics and geometric interaction conditions, thus providing a framework in which complex, decentralized control strategies can be implemented.  
<br/>  </p>

<p>Embedded Graph Grammar based methods specific to multi-agent coordination have been presented in 6, and previously in the GRITS lab, algorithms were developed to determine if a mobile robot network with a predefined sensor and communication range can persistently achieve a specified formation, that is, whether the multi-agent formations can be preserved by the direct maintenance of a subset of inter-agent distances 7. In addition, graph operations were developed to describe agent interactions that implement a given formation, and if persistent, can automatically generate a sequence of such operations.  </p>

<p>This research project aims to continue the efforts in extending the current Embedded Graph Grammar framework by developing additional control laws and protocols, in particular, methods for the automatic generation of graph grammars from persistent graphs. By extending the pervious persistent graph algorithm from the automatic generation of graph operations to graph grammars and control laws, graph grammars and control modes can be combined in a hybrid fashion. Once a comprehensive framework is completed, the resulting system will then be implemented on a swarm of iRobot Create robots equipped with GPS as well as wireless communication.

 summary : <p>Jvex-robotics interfaces Java single board computers to the VEX Robotics Robotics Design System Kit. The goal is to free the Java host from low-level device management by delegating these tasks to the VEX Controller that comes with the kit. The result is that a Java host can easily manage real-time VEX devices over a serial protocol. </p>

<p>The VEX controller directly manages sensor and motor hardware. Given a decent &#39;C&#39; compiler, the pair of PIC microprocessors is well suited for offloading low-level, real-time device control from the Java host. </p>

<p>The serial protocol incorporates I/O Point Tagging which provides a means for peripherals to characterize themselves via XML descriptors to the host.</p>

 title : The robwork Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RobWork is a framework for simulation and control of robotics with emphasis on industrial robotics and their applications. </p>

<p>Major goals of this framework: </p>

<p>Provide a single framework for offline and online robot programming including modelling, simulation and (realtime)control of robotics Target audience: </p>

<p>esearchers who needs a common framework for experimental robotics tudents who wants to experiment with concepts of robotics mplementers of robot applications Dependencies: </p>

<p>This framework uses the following 3rd party libraries: </p>

<p>stl (C++ Standart Template Library) boost (Peer-reviewed C++ libraries) boost::ublas, for basic linear algebra LAPACK, for numerical computations OpenGL, for visualization Qt4, for user interface opcode, for collision detection </p>

<p>RobWork use the cmake build system. </p>

<p>Since this library uses boost, and other modern frameworks, a modern (2000+) C++ compiler like GCC 3 or Visual C++ 7 is required. Not all files are expected to compile without problems on ancient C++ compilers. </p>

<p>RobWork Features </p>

<p>List of features in the RobWork c++ library. </p>

<p>Math package based on Boost/Ublas with varius mathematical constructs for calculating and describing 3d kinematic scenes and other robot specific stuff. Loading and visualising of devices with a variety of kinematic structures (SerialDevice, TreeDevice, ParallelDevice, MobileDevice). General iterative forward and inverse kinematics for all types of devices.</p>

 title : The tomatobot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project sets out to create a robot that can farm tomatoes using open source components including dd-wrt, python robotics, and distributed processing with GNU/Linux. The idea is to use a web services type architecture with large numbers of diverse brains contributing to one another as well as controlling the physical robot(s).f pyrobot as a service in the network as tomatobot&#39;s intelligence. Tomatobot&#39;s control systems will be running on the local hardware.  </p>

<p>It is hoped that scaling tomatobot&#39;s A.I. across large number of machines will increase both its usefulness and level of autonomy. </p>

<p>We are currently using a Assus WL-500GPv2 running dd-wrt and arduino diecimila(s) as the tomatobot&#39;s on-board conroll system. The Assus is using usb over serial to drive the arduino microcontroller(s)(SERIAL Over USB).  </p>

<p>The plan is to add vision capabilities using a ethernet webcam. Distance information will be gathered using 8 unit sonar array mounted on a 1:12 scale RC tank chassis, and an industrial arm for manipulation of objects in it&#39;s environment. We will also be leveraging many of the advanced AI modules already in Python Robots with a xml-rpc stack between the server side robot intelligence. The client assus/arduino will have a xml-rpc2serial implementation to complete intelligence to physical actuator loop.</p>

 title : The mobile-google-talk-http Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ABOUT
<br/>----======----
<br/>mobile-google-talk-http is an extension of the MGTalk J2ME application to support the HTTP Binding (JEP-124). The original MGTalk application is a well-done Jabber client for J2ME. It also supports some Google Talk specific features. However, it does not support an HTTP communication mechanism for Jabber (a.k.a HTTP Binding or JEP-124). For more info on the original MGTalk project see here: http://mgtalk.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>The initial version (Release 0.1) of mobile-google-talk-http just adds basic HTTP Binding support to MGTalk. I&#39;ve talked with the owner of MGTalk and he will include it in the original project.</p>

<p>The aim of mobile-google-talk-http is to provide a neat J2ME application for Google Talk, specialized on Google Talk. The next release will include a fullscreen, more Google Talk style user interface. Also, HTTP Binding support will be improved (spec not fully implemented yet).</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;USING MOBILE-GOOGLE-TALK-HTTP
<br/>----=============================----
<br/>There are now two additional settings in the configuration options:
<br/>* Use HTTP Binding? [checkbox]
<br/>* HTTP Binding url  [textfield]
<br/>Check the first option &#39;Use HTTP Binding?&#39; if you want to connect via a HTTP Binding gateway, specify the url of the HTTP Binding gateway in the &#39;HTTP Binding url&#39; text field. Use the &#39;http[s]://host[:port]/path&#39; format for the url. If the checkbox is unchecked then the url has no effect.</p>

<p>Using the HTTP Binding means, that the J2ME app connects to the gateway specified at &#39;HTTP Binding url&#39; and routes the XMPP messages to the XMPP server (specified with &#39;Host name&#39;, &#39;Port&#39; and &#39;SSL?&#39;). Note that Google is not running an HTTP Binding gateway (AFAIK -- please correct me if I am wrong. Basic network analysis shows me that the Gmail web chat does not use HTTP Binding), thus you either need to run your own gateway, or use one that is publicly available.
<br/>* e.g. Punjab (http://punjab.sourceforge.net/) is such a HTTP Binding gateway
<br/>* the only public http binding gateway i am aware of is &#39;https://www.butterfat.net:443/punjab/httpb/&#39;. please drop me a note if you know more...</p>

 title : The nemesisrd1x Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>La Suite NemesisRD 1.x es un conjunto de bibliotecas de clases escritas íntegramente en C++ cuyo objetivo es facilitar el desarrollo de aplicaciones profesionales. </p>

<p>Las facilidades que ofrece la Suite NemesisRD 1.x está especialmente orientado hacia el desarrollo de aplicaciones distribuidas,  aunque también ha sido usada con éxito en el desarrollo de aplicaciones de consola. </p>

<p>Las plataformas nativas de NemesisRD 1.x son Linux y Solaris, tanto en 32 bits como en 64 bits. </p>

<p>Las facilidades más destacables podrían ser: </p>

<p>Desarrollo general de aplicaciones. Implementación optimizada de los patrones de diseño más populares, configuración de la línea de comandos, control de componentes, respuesta a señales de SO, interpretación y creación de documentos XML, sistema de trazas, capacidades multithreading, etc. </p>

<p>Uso en aplicaciones distribuidas. Sistemas de alta disponibilidad, tolerancia a fallos, reparto automático de carga, reparto automático de atención y control de la congestión. Permite la interoperabilidad con software de terceros al ofrecer módulos para tratar los protocolos más usados por la industria  como: SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, LDAP y SIP.   </p>

<p>   Conectividad a base de datos. Sistema de acceso a base de datos similar a JDBC que permite aislar el código de la aplicación del motor particular que se esté usando. Una aplicación podría estar conectada simultáneamente con un número interminado de servidores de base de datos; en el caso más extremo cada uno de estos servidores podría estar usando un motor (MySQL, Postgres u Oracle) distinto.      </p>

<p>Tratamiento de objetos persistentes. Permiten instanciar las entidades persistentes guardadas en la base de datos como si fuera un objeto C++. El programador no tiene que preocuparse de cómo se transfiere la información del medio físico al objeto C++. Adicionalmente ofrece un sistema de acceso rápido, que optimiza el acceso a estos objetos C++.  </p>

<p>Nueva WEB de proyecto: http://code.google.com/p/nemesisrd/ </p>

<p>Suite NemesisRD 1.x is a set of libraries and clases written in C++ whose main target is to make the professional application development easier. </p>

<p>Features offered by the Suite NemesisRD 1.x are specially focussed on distributed application development, although it had been succesfully used to develop console application. </p>

<p>The native platform of Suite NemesisRD 1.x are Linux 2.x and Solaris 5.x, both 32 bits and 64 bits. </p>

<p>The main features are: </p>

<p>General development application. Improved implementation of most popular pattern designs, command line configuration,control of component application, OS signal processing, interpretation and creation of XML documents, logging system, multithreading capabilities, and so on. </p>

<p>Distribuited applications. Classes that offer high availability systems, fault tolerance, download and upload balancing, attencion balancing and control congestion. It enables interoperability with third parties software, offering a lot of popular industry protocol like: SSL, HTTP, HTTPS,SOAP, LDAP and SIP. </p>

<p>Database connecting. One database access system similar to JDBC that isolates the application code from the engine database in use. One application would be simultaneously connected to a unknown number of database servers, on the most extrem example, every database server could be using a different engine (mysql, postgre, oracle). </p>

<p>Persistent objects. Instantiate persistent entities previously recorded on the database like a common C++ instance. The programmer has not to think about how the information was transfered from the physical media to the C++ instance. As well it offers a quick access system, that optimize the access to the C++ persistent instances. </p>

 title : The socks-via-http Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Socks via HTTP is a program converting SOCKS requests into HTTP requests and tunnelling
<br/>them through HTTP proxies if needed. The SOCKS protocol allows programs to traverse firewalls on any port number
<br/>and is used by many popular programs, like Napster, MSN Messenger, CRT(telnet client)
<br/>and many others. Many companies restrict firewall traversals only to HTTP requests,
<br/>disabling SOCKS proxy. Socks via HTTP provides a miniature SOCKS server for the SOCKS client,
<br/>performing its connection through an HTTP proxy to a remote server, which establishes the real connection.</p>

<p>Please read carefully the INSTALL and DOCUMENTATION files.
<br/>You can always get the last version of the program, and some documentation at http://cqs.dyndns.org</p>

 title : The bugsparallel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>bugsParallel is a set of R functions for distributed computing with WinBUGS. BugsParallel: </p>

<p>Has been successfully installed on MS Windows and Mac OS X platforms. Is a modified subset of the R2WinBUGS package.  Uses the R package Rmpi to implement a network of Windows workstations.  Uses the rlecuyer package for parallel random number generation.  When used for a Bayesian analysis, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations generate samples that approximate the joint posterior distribution of the sampled parameters. The sequential nature of MCMC simulation limits the beneﬁts of parallel computation when applied to a single chain. However parallel computation of multiple chains is an “embarassingly parallel” problem that can substantially reduce computation time and is relatively easy to implement using bugsParallel in combination with other freely available software. bugsParallel is an active, open-source project of Metrum Institute (http://metruminstitute.org).</p>

 title : The decs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThe goal of this project is to implement Donald E. Knuth&#39;s recursive Dancing Links (DLX) algorithm as a parallel algorithm. This will enable the workload to be distributed among a network of computer systems using BOINC. By scaling the system in this manner we will be able to solve more complex problems than those which can be solved by a single system. </p>

<p>The DLX algorithm solves exact cover problems which includes: Polyomino tiling, Latin square puzzles, Sudoku, n-queens, set packing and set partitioning problems. </p>

<p>The &quot;DECS Dance&quot; release contains programs and libraries to generate DLX matrices and run the DLX algorithm on a single computer. </p>

<p>DECS was initially developed by Jan Magne Tjensvold as a project in computer engineering at the University of Stavanger. </p>

<p>News2008-12-12Experiencing some trouble getting the BOINC server to start. It seems to break down from time to time so it might be time to do a reinstall and start from scratch. 2008-05-14Power failure problem solved and a new UPS has been installed. 2008-04-24Problems with multiple power failures breaking the UPS for the BOINC server. 2007-12-17Added the package with MATLAB files using the GPenSIM package to model and simulate the DECS system using Petri nets. This is the code used in the report to simulate the system. 2007-12-12The DECS BOINC server is being prepared for use. You can download the official BOINC client and join the project now. Currently the server can only facilitate Windows 32-bit and 64-bit clients, but Linux and other operating systems are on the way. 2007-10-04Version 0.2 of the DECS programs and libraries has been released. New additions includes: </p>

<p>degen program for general purpose DLX matrix generation with libnqdecs as a support library for generating n-queens matrices. Full support in libdlx for solving general cover problems by using secondary columns. Build support for cmake which makes it easier to build DECS on other platforms. </p>

<p>2007-10-01Version 0.1 of the dance program and the DLX library has been released. Check the download page for more detail.</p>

 summary : <p>Heterogeneous distributed computing is found in a variety of fields including scientific computing, Internet and mobile devices. Computational grids focusing primarily on computationally-intensive operations have emerged as a new infrastructure for high performance computing. Specific algorithms such as scheduling, load balancing and data redistribution have been devised to overcome the limitations of these systems and take full advantage of their processing power. However, experimental validation and fine-tuning of such algorithms require multiple heterogeneous platforms and configurations.  </p>

<p>EHGrid is a computational grid emulator based on the heterogeneous emulator Wrekavoc. EHGrid reshapes the virtual topology of a homogeneous cluster, degrades the performance of the processors and modifies the characteristics of the network links in an accurate, independent and reproducible way. </p>

<p>EHGrid borrows the core concept and the CPU limiter code from Wrekavoc, a software developed at the INRIA Nancy in France. EHGrid adds numerous features like topology emulation, portability (python), automatic mapping, OpenGL vizualization (with VTK). </p>

<p>EHGrid is a subproject of my Master in Computer Science research at the University of New-Brunswick. I am working with Dr. Eric Aubanel and the Grid Computing Research Group at the UNB. </p>

<p>Currently, this site holds a tidy cleaned up codebase concurrently with the older repository. Next revisions will focus on  cleaning and documenting this code.</p>

 title : The numbrellacomputing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The concept of Numbrella computingThere is a great lot of unused computational power as well as free disk space or even network bandwidth today. Everybody seems to notice a trend toward some kind of socialization of these resources. Peer-to-peer networks are helping people to share and even store easily great amounts of information, saving time and bandwidth for other Internet users and online services, providing rapid access and fair treatment to those who help. So, why not share and use some of computational power, which is now growing rapidly and little amount of it is used only by roughly centralized distributed computational projects? Numbrella Computing project&#39;s goal is to provide immediate, secure, fair access to computational resources. </p>

<p>ApplicationNumbrella Computing Project is the solution for bringing in Internet users with unutilized computational resources and efficiently solving complex scientific problems.

 title : The quillweb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Condor, a system for high throughput computing, schedules user–submitted jobs on idle workstations and dedicated clusters of machines. This project builds on Quill, an add–on to Condor that improves the data collection, retention, and query capabilities of Condor. A running Condor system generates a large amount of operational data about the machines and jobs in the system. While Condor stores information about current jobs and partial information about completed jobs in text logs that are distributed throughout the system, Quill stores this information in a central database. Quill also has the capabilities to gather and store additional information about machines, the job–machine matching process, and file transfers. By storing the data about a Condor pool in a central relational database, Quill provides fast and flexible access to the operational and history data gathered from a Condor pool. </p>

<p>This Google Code Project provides a PHP based web interface to the data gathered by Quill, and allows Condor administrators and users to be able to easily explore the state and history of their Condor pool.</p>

 title : The biopieces Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BiopiecesThe Biopieces are a collection of bioinformatics tools that can be pieced together in a very easy and flexible manner to perform both simple and complex tasks. The Biopieces work on a data stream in such a way that the data stream can be passed through several different Biopieces, each performing one specific task: modifying or adding records to the data stream, creating plots, or uploading data to databases and web services. The Biopieces are executed in a command line environment where the data stream is initialized by specific Biopieces which read data from files, databases, or web services, and output records to the data stream that is passed to downstream Biopieces until the data stream is terminated at the end of the analysis as outlined below:  </p>

<p>read_data | calculate_something | write_results The following example demonstrates how a Solexa deep sequencing experiment can be analyzed – including removal of adaptor sequence, determining the number of unique sequences, mapping to a specified genome, and uploading the data to the UCSC genome browser for further analysis:  </p>

<p>read_solexa –i data.solexa |              #  Initialize data stream from a file. 
<br/>remove_adaptor -a TCGTATGCC -m 2 |        #  Remove adaptor sequence allowing for 2 mismatches. 
<br/>grab –e ‘ADAPTOR_POS &gt; -1’ |              #  Get all entries where an adaptor sequence was found. 
<br/>count_vals –k SEQ |                       #  Determine the occurrences of all sequences.  
<br/>uniq_vals –k SEQ |                        #  Get all entries with a unique sequence. 
<br/>merge_vals –k SEQ_NAME,SEQ_COUNT |        #  Append the sequence count to the sequence name. 
<br/>vmatch_seq –g hg18 |                      #  Map the sequences to the Human genome using Vmatch. 
<br/>upload_to_ucsc –d hg18 –t solexa_data –x  #  Upload the mapping results to the UCSC Genome Browser. The advantage of the Biopieces is that a user can easily solve simple and complex tasks without having any programming experience. Moreover, since the data format used to pass data between Biopieces is text based, different developers can quickly create new Biopieces in their favorite programming language - and all the Biopieces will maintain compatibility. </p>

<p>There are currently ~140 Biopieces. </p>

<p>To learn more about Biopieces have a look at the Biopieces Introduction. To browse the available Biopieces go to the Biopieces Wiki. If you want to install the Biopieces go to the Biopieces Installation Instructions. If you want to contribute Biopieces go to the Biopieces HowTo.

 title : The data-mediator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>InspirationI guess i&#39;m not the only one tired of writting similar or the same PHP code for web forms and or requests over and over again. Number, date or money input and output fields, file uploads... I&#39;m not talking user interface implementation but converting and validating the values passed to your server side script and feeding them back to your view. Some kind of data mediator. Something i could use in combination with any Javascript framework to create the user interface or simply plain old HTML input fields. Something which would easily integrate with my existing PHP framework. </p>

<p>I found many packages out there which are trying to do form validation and rendering. Honestly, have you ever satisfied a client by presenting some auto generated form (except maybe in the admin interface)? I rather leave the form design and implementation to the web 2.0 nerds and focus on what is necassary to deliver a solid controller layer... </p>

<p>After doing some research, i came along the Java Server Pages concept of converter and validator which is exactly what i needed to plug between the untyped $_REQUEST array and my controller. A simple and straight forward abstraction of my basic problem to ensure datatypes and valid values between requests. </p>

<p>Data mediatorBecause you hardly ever just use a single converter or validator i&#39;ve written the DataMediator which basically defines a list of converters and validators. The DataMediator wraps around your data ie. the $_REQUEST array or maybe $_FILES for file uploads and handles the convertion and validation of it. </p>

<p>ExampleThis is a basic example of what the Data Mediator is about.  </p>

<p>Say we have a form that only takes a date. The date has to be in the format of dd/mm/yyyy and it can not be greater than today.  </p>

<p>Now setting up the Data Mediator looks like this: </p>

<p>//Change the locale to german (optional)
<br/>setlocale(LC_ALL,&#39;de_DE@euro&#39;,&#39;de_DE&#39;,&#39;de&#39;,&#39;ge&#39;,&#39;german&#39;);</p>

<p>//Create a new DataMediator and pass the request to it (Can also be $_FILE depending on it&#39;s use)
<br/>$data= new DataMediator($_REQUEST);Now that we have an instance of the Data Mediator we can now set it up to convert and validate the users input from a form. </p>

<p>// Date converter
<br/>$data-&gt;setConverter(&#39;dateField&#39;,&#39;Date&#39;)
<br/>        -&gt;setDefault(new DateTime(&#39;tomorrow&#39;))
<br/>        -&gt;setFormat(&#39;%d/%m/%Y&#39;)
<br/>        -&gt;setErrorMessage(&#39;Invalid date entered: %s&#39;);This converter will convert any data entered into the input field named &#39;dateField&#39;. If it can&#39;t convert the input into a DateTime object, the error message set for the converter will be added to the error list. </p>

<p>// Date range validator
<br/>$data-&gt;addValidator(&#39;dateField&#39;,&#39;DateRange&#39;)
<br/>        -&gt;setMax(new DateTime(&#39;today&#39;))
<br/>        -&gt;setErrorMessage(&#39;Date must be before today&#39;);The validator checks if the date provided is not greater than the date created today. If the date is greater than today it will fail and the set error message will be added to the error list.  </p>

<p>The form inputs would look something like this: </p>

<p>This setup allows the data entered by the user to be persistent on the form. The set value requires a string, this is why we convert the &#39;dataField&#39; to  a sring using: </p>

<p>getAsString(&#39;dataField&#39;); ?&gt;The following shows how to retrieve the converted and validated data: </p>

<p>// conversion and validation
<br/>if (!($errors= $data-&gt;getErrors())) {
<br/>	// DateTime object
<br/>        $date= $data-&gt;getAsDatatype(&#39;date&#39;);
<br/>}This firstly checks if there are any errors to report. If there are errors an array is created filled the errors and stored in $errors.  </p>

<p>The second part shows to retrieve the datatype that was requested, in this case it is a DateTime object. </p>

<p>There are two ways to display the errors, first there is to list them all as bullet points:  </p>

<p>        </p>

<p>While the second method is to print the result underneath each field that has errors. </p>

<p>getErrors(&#39;dateField&#39;);
<br/>?&gt;</p>

<p>        </p>

<p>ConverterConverters are responsible for turning strings into a specific datatype and via versa. In case of a number converter it type casts the string into a number ie. (float)$string and can convert a number into a string obeying set system locales. The number converter also provides a property to restrict it to int values. Another useful property of all converters is the default value which is returned when the String value for a convertion is NULL. This is dictated by the ConverterBase class where all my converters are inherited from. You can overwrite this behavior in custom converter classes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for simple datatypes (int, bool, etc.) to do this kind of conversion on each request but what happens with complex types like objects (eg. DateTime) or when you have to work with i18n. </p>

<p>ValidatorValidators make sure you are getting the value you expect. Since converters always return the correct datatype or NULL it is an easy task for validators to check for the right value and just as easy to create your own cutomised validators. </p>

<p>A validator has just one function: validate($value). It takes a value and throws an exception if validation failes. Validators with exception of the RequiredValidator don&#39;t get invoked if the value to validate is NULL. This can be changed when writing your own validator.</p>

 summary : <p>ECS289 – Data Mining Assignment 1 - NetFlixTeam Members: Justin Becker, Philip Fisher-Ogden Team Name: TeamSpelunker Project Name: MovieMiner </p>

<p>OutlineIn this proposal we introduce the recommendation system MovieMiner. The system&#39;s primary objective is to predict the future movie ratings of customers. The training data that will be used is a subset of the Netflix competition data, which consists of millions of customer movie ratings (). The test data provides users and movies () and asks the system to predict a rating.   </p>

<p>MovieMiner&#39;s design choices take into consideration the assignment guidelines. The first guideline is that no external data sources are permitted. To meet this constraint and provide a useful system MovieMiner will leverage collaborative filtering techniques. The underlying assumption of collaborative filtering is: &quot;those who agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future&quot; 1. In line with the first guideline, collaborative filtering does not take into consideration external domain knowledge. All that is required of a simple collaborative filtering system is previously acquired data.  The second assignment guideline is that the system can leverage association rule mining, clustering, and classification techniques.  We intend on building a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier 4, 5 to provide our item-based movie ratings predictions.  We have decided to use only item-based collaborative filtering 12 for the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, rather than a combination of user-based and item-based approaches (see 13 for a discussion on how both could be used).  The main motivating factor for this decision is that the number of items is significantly lower than the number of users, making it more efficient to pre-compute the item-item similarities matrix than the user-user one. </p>

<p>Our approach is to use collaborative filtering with item-based similarities to predict the unlabeled ratings in the test data.  We will build an item-item similarities matrix from the training data, where an entry rij in the matrix will contain a measure of similarity between movies i and j.  The similarity scores will be calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between movies, taken across their common raters.  To identify a rating r for item i and user u, the top k similar items (neighbors) that were rated by u will be retrieved from the item-item similarities matrix.  The predicted rating r for item i and user u will be the sum of interpolation weights and u&#39;s rating values for the top-k similar items.  The interpolation weights will be computed as a global solution to an optimization problem (described in detail in \4\).  </p>

 title : The foxtract Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Foxtract is a simple, free and open source Outlook Express e-mail message extractor that works with corrupted data files. </p>

<p>Sometimes Outlook Express has the bad habit of corrupting some of its data files (usually this is one of your Outlook Express folders, often the Inbox if you never sorted your messages ;-). A typical situation is when it re-compacts its data file or when the size exceeds 2 Gb. </p>

<p>Some recovery tools try to rebuild or read from the tree structure that Outlook Express uses internally. This can sometimes be quite difficult if the tree is very damaged. Foxtract takes a different approach: it will scan the whole data file to find all message segments, which it will use to determine the head segment of a message. A single mail can be composed of several segments - every segment takes up to 512 bytes, so for instance a 3 Mb message will be composed of 6144 segments. Once the head segment is found, there is a good chance that the message can be retrieved. </p>

<p>Please be aware that this tool will only read the messages from Outlook Express data files (files with the .dbx extension). It will not read or recover messages from Office&#39;s Outlook, which are stored in a .pst file -- this is because although they share a common name, both programs are very different and don&#39;t use the same data format. </p>

<p>Foxtract runs and has been tested on both Linux and Windows (x86). It will probably compile on other architectures, but the results won&#39;t be quite as good as expected on big-endian processors.</p>

 summary : <p>hxFormat is the repository for different file-formats support for the haXe language. </p>

<p>FormatsCurrently supported formats are : </p>

<p>FLV (Flash Video) AMF0 (Flash serialized object) PDF (only generic file structure and partial decryption) ZIP TAR GZ PBJ (PixelBender Binary file) SWF (Flash file format) ABC (Flash AS3 bytecode format) MP3 Planned future formats include : </p>

<p>AMF3 (supported in FlashPlayer 9+) PE (Windows EXE) DMG (Mac ISO) PNG, JPG ... anything you want to contribute (please ask on the haXe mailing list) InstallationhxFormat is available on haxelib, so simply run the following command : haxelib install format. To use the library, simply add -lib format to your commandline parameters. </p>

<p>Package StructureEach format lies in its own package, for example format.pdf contains classes for PDF. </p>

<p>The format.tools package contain some tools that might be shared by several formats but don&#39;t belong to a specific one. </p>

<p>Each format must provide the following files : </p>

<p>one Data.hx file that contain only data structures / enums used by the format. If there is really a lot, they can be separated into several files, but it&#39;s often my easy for the end user to only have to do one single import format.xxx.Data to access to all the defined types. one Reader.hx class which enable to read the file format from an haxe.io.Input one Writer.hx class which enable to write the file format to an haxe.io.Output some other classes that might be necessary for manipulating the data structures </p>

<p>It&#39;s important in particular that the data structures storing the decoded information are separated from the actual classes manipulating it. This enable full access to all the file format infos and the ability to easily write libraries that manipulate the format, even if later the Reader implementation is changed for example.</p>
 title : The hydrosanity Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hydrosanity is an add-on package for R. It provides a graphical user interface for exploring hydrological time series. It is designed to work with catchment surface hydrology data (mainly rainfall and streamflow time series at a set of locations). There are functions to import from a database or files; summarise and visualise the dataset in various ways; estimate areal rainfall; fill gaps in rainfall data; and estimate the rainfall-runoff relationship. Probably the most useful features are the interactive graphical displays of a spatial set of time series. </p>

<p>WARNING: this package is under development and should not be considered stable. An introductory paper is included, but there is not much detailed documentation. </p>

<p>Hydrosanity was developed by Felix Andrews, and the Graphical User Interface was based on Rattle by Graham Williams. </p>

<p>InstallationMake sure you have the GTK+ libraries, version &gt;= 2.10.11: Windows: download and install the Gtk+/Win32 Runtime Environment from here (~6MB). MacOS: a GTK+ installer is available here (~19MB). GNU/Linux: GTK+ is usually included by default on these systems. Install R. Hydrosanity requires R version 2.5.0 or later. Here is a link to the latest stable Windows release. Install the packages in R:  install.packages(&quot;hydrosanity&quot;) -- this will also install the dependencies RGtk2, playwith and reshape. install.packages(c(&quot;sp&quot;, &quot;rgdal&quot;, &quot;maptools&quot;, &quot;tripack&quot;, &quot;gpclib&quot;, &quot;akima&quot;, &quot;maps&quot;)) if you want spatial functions. install.packages(&quot;mapdata&quot;) (a 24MB download!) if you want higher resolution world coastlines and rivers on maps. library(hydrosanity) to load the package, and then hydrosanity() to start the graphical user interface. TroubleshootingTry updating packages with update.packages() or the corresponding menu item in your R GUI. If you experience crashes, try updating to the latest GTK+ libraries (2.10.x).   Things often don&#39;t get refreshed until you move the mouse around, so the program may appear to have stopped. This is a known limitation of RGtk2. Also, the main RGui sometimes flips to the front, hiding the Hydrosanity window. To avoid that, just minimise RGui.</p>

<br/>Index &amp; Search</p>

<p>The pure Python index and search engine (itools.catalog): full text indexing, boolean, phrase and range searches. Simple to use and to deploy, best fit for the small to medium size applications.</p>

<p>Internationalization
<br/>Language negotiation, text segmentation, fuzzy matching, language guessing, support for the GNU gettext tools, automatic extraction of translatable messages from (X)HTML documents. These and other features make of itools a must-have in the toolbox of the international Python developer.</p>

<p>Resource - Handlers
<br/>The most difficult-to-explain part of itools, the resource handlers are also, probably, the most powerful feature. A flexible and consistent way to implement the business logic, built around the filesystem model: store your data wherever you want, control the way it is serialized, enjoy a powerful high-level API that smoothly degrades to the low-level... Grasp it and multiply your productivity!</p>

<p>Standard file formats
<br/>XML, (X)HTML, CSV, PO/MO (from GNU Gettext), iCalendar (RFC2445), RSS 2.0, TMX, XLIFF. Enjoy the ever-growing support for standard file formats provided by itools.
<br/>The Simple Template Language
<br/>You think all template languages are the same? We get back the meaning of the word simple, without lossing any power: STL is a declarative template language for XML files (the logic belongs to Python). Quick to learn, high-productivity in demanding environments, and fast.</p>

<p>The CMS (a.k.a. iKaaro)

 title : The lib-vtk-io Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>LIB_VTK_IO is a Fortran library to write and read (actually only to write)  data  conforming the VTK standard, Visualization Toolkit from Kiteware, both binary and ascii. Even though there are many wrappers/porting of the VTK source code (C++ code), there is not a fortran one. This library is not a porting or a wrapper of the VTK code, but it is only an exporter/importer of the VTK data format written in pure fortran language (standard Fortran 95 with some extensions of Fortran 2003) that can be used by fortran coders (yes, there are still a lot of these brave coders...) without mixing fortran with C++ language. </p>

<p>The library is still in developing and testing; this one is the first usable release, but there are not all the features of the future stable release (the importer is totaly absent and the exporter is not complete). Surely there are a lot of bugs and the progamming style is not the best, but the exporter is usable for the 90% of the VTK data format.</p>

<p>Requirementslistocracy is a set of PHP functions that can find a list of television providers based on a zip code, and then produce an array of television listing data. listocracy&#39;s only requirement is that PHP needs to have the Curl extension installed. </p>

<p>Functionsmixed get_providers( zipcode )This function takes any five digit zip of postal code. It then returns an array of available television providers with the provider id and the provider name. With an invalid zip code this function returns false. </p>

 summary : <p>The MailChimp LOLCode interpreter allows you to write and run lolcode scripts. It mostly conforms to the lolcode 1.0 spec and picks up pieces of the more recent 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 specs/proprosals where we needed something they defined. After that, we just made things up. Also, when we didn&#39;t like something or found something more lulzy, we just did whatever we pleased. </p>

<p>Some highlights of what the interpreter supports: </p>

<p>BUKKIT - multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays/hashes GIMMEH - io - file i/o, read from STDIN, network IO via http (see test4.lol for a working example of network IO + LOL) MOARAGINS - eval() lolcode  POOPONIT! - analogous to PHP&#39;s var_dump() for variable inspection This code was developed using Tetraboy&#39;s parser and we have, in fact, left some of that code intact in this release. Tetraboy&#39;s original site and code is here: </p>

<p>http://www.tetraboy.com/lolcode/ </p>

<p> </p>

<p>LOLLOL is our very own acronym for a standardized data format that can be consumed by a lolcode script. It stands for LOL Objekt Langwedge. You can think of it like JSON, but in a more lulzy fashion.  </p>

<p>Also, really, it&#39;s just the bukkit grammar, but how could we pass up a recursive acronym, yaknow? </p>

<p>So far the only compatible web service that we&#39;ve found to implement a version of LOL compatible with this implementation is, well, our very own web API :) Check it out here: </p>

<p>http://www.mailchimp.com/api/ 
<br/>     A sample data of the data can be found here (test4.lol connects to this as well) http://www.mailchimp.com/api/downloads/lol 
<br/>     Flickr and Pownce both implement similar versions of LOL, but they are not compatible. Since they were not the same and neither actually followed the LOLCode specs very closely, we did not build ours to match or support them. Maybe they&#39;ll join the fun now? </p>

<p>ExamplesWe&#39;ve packaged up some example scripts in the downloadable packages and they are also available from our repository... here are links to some: </p>

<p>test.lol - This is from Tetraboy&#39;s original index.lol example. It opens a SQLite db and prints data from it test2.lol - This example shows creating an associative array and printing its values. test3.lol - This example shows reading in LOL format, eval&#39;ing it, and then iterating over and printing the &#39;imported&#39; variables. test4.lol - This example shows off using the IO package to download a LOL formatted data file over the intertubes, evals it, and works with the data in the local scope test5.lol - This example shows off using the IO package to prompt for input to save in a variable, then spits it back out. test6.lol - This is from Tetraboy&#39;s original index.lol example. It shows defining a function, variable assignments, and incrememting numbers kthxbye!</p>

<p>In most cases, all of these scripts were incorporated as part of my dissertation, thus their storage here.   </p>

<p>I have put these here for 3 main purposes: </p>

<p>So that others may use them w/o having to re-invent the wheel For review and refactoring by others For the purposes of archival Code bits (all in the Subversion Trunk at this site): </p>

 title : The open-pl2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>See current Progress </p>

<p>OverviewThis is an attempt at writing an open source engine and toolset for the somewhat popular PolygonLove2 (PL2, ポリゴンラブ２) Japanese 3D dating sim game made by Purple Heart. </p>

<p>No resource files will be provided here, just the engine. The best part of a dating sim game is the story and characters, so go buy the original! </p>

<p>However tools to create new resource files and edit existing ones will be made available here when the formats have been fully reversed. </p>

<p>If you have any suggestion or comment, feel free to make an &#39;issue&#39; or email me (LightDark3D </p>

<p> gmail  com). Also feel free to just say hi and that you&#39;re interested in the project. The more people I know are interested, the more I&#39;ll want to work on it.  </p>

<p>All user interface use QT4, this should run on Windows, Mactels and Unix machines. </p>

<p>All 3D code uses OpenGL and Cg. </p>

<p>Please note: PolygonLove2 is an &#39;18&#39; rated game, and does contain explicit content. This project page will not contain any such content, or link to it. </p>

<p>LibraryThe library (reads files, etc) is written in C99 and can be used with Windows, UNIX and Mac systems. The only dependency it has at the moment is iconv, which can be disabled. </p>

<p>The PL2 format library doesn&#39;t support big-endian machines (though this shouldn&#39;t be hard to change). </p>

<p>Currently the library can not open compressed PL2 files, since the compression system is still being reversed. (The &#39;PakPl2.exe&#39; tool creates uncompressed PL2 files, however the files which come with the game are compressed. You can use MltPl2.exe to unpack the PL2 files and then repack them with PakPl2.exe to create compatible files.) </p>

<p>ViewerThe viewer at the moment supports loading and displaying of TMB model files using the format library. There is no animation support yet. </p>

<p>TODOIn order of priroty:  </p>

<p>PL2 Decompression support TSB reverse/finish TMB reverse Bone palette generation (model seem to use around 200 bones, but shader only have about 30 loaded at a time) Animation Clean up 3D viewer and upload Various import/export tools for file formats PSD import support (Why they use PSD?) Extended format and feature creation (see below) Script support for story mode I&#39;d also like to setup a website somewhere suitible hosting user created models and modifications. Please e-mail me if you have suitible hosting. </p>

<p>Super-PL2After I have the basic PL2 format support done, I plan to add new features that might be fun to code. These will really be just so I can mess around. </p>

<p>New mesh/animation formats supporting more stuff Liquid simulation Cloth and hair dynamic HQ screenshot/video-capture support (using global illumination, etc) Fun fragment shaders (cel shading, fur?, etc) </p>

<p>Q&amp;AQ) Why is the format library in C, but the rest of the project in C++? A) I prefer to have libraries and such as C since then I (and other people) can use them in non-C++ projects MUCH easier. </p>

<p>Q) Why QT4? A) It&#39;s a nice multiplatform GUI that works well on the different platforms. I do not think GTK works well on non-unix platforms, and I don&#39;t think .NET works well on non-windows platforms. </p>

<p>Q) Who are you? And why work on this project. A) A game developer currently working in Japan. It&#39;s mainly so I can mess around with a relativly simple game system and add some fun features.</p>
 title : The open-source-feed-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Open Source Feed Engine (OSFE) is a world class open source feed engine application designed to manage and process multiple feed files of varying file formats, with varying behaviors, containing a few rows of data to millions of rows. OSFE processes files of delimited, fixed and single row XML formats, right out of the box. 
<br/>Installation OSFE and run demo </p>

<p>OSFE provides a common framework and design patterns for three primary types of feed processing engines:   </p>

<p>Data Retriever Engines – Engines that retrieve data from internal or external sources (e.g., retrieving data via socket, FTP, Web Service). Retrieved files may also need to be prepared for processing (e.g., data may need to be unzipped, unencrypted, concatenated, etc).   Inbound Data Processing Engines – A raw data that has been retrieved and prepared for processing is parsed, passed through phases and processed into meaningful data (e.g., filtered, calculated and sent to persistent storage).   Outbound Data Creation Engines – Data is pulled from database tables or files, processed and placed into a feed file in a specified format (e.g., sending an enrollment response to complete the contract from a given enrollment request feed). </p>

<p>At it&#39;s core,  OSFE is driven by several key concepts: </p>

<p>XML driven -  OSFE needs an XML document to instruct it on how to process a given feed file.    Service driven – OSFE uses services to define its core behavior. These core services all are also defined within the XML feed document an can be interchanged to modify OSFE&#39;s core behavior. OSFE comes with a set of core services designed to cover most feed processing tasks. Phase driven – OSFE processes feeds by passing data through one of more phases.  Each phase has the responsibility of performing specific operations on the given data. Phase definitions are added to an XML feed document to instruct OSFE on how to process a feed.   Database driven – OSFE uses a database to manage the complete life cycle of processing a feed. The databases maintains a description of all feed files, feed types and data sources. It also maintains a permanent history of each feed run. Life Cycle driven – OSFE defines a framework for managing the complete feed processing life cycle that includes handling exceptions for failing a feed, retrying a failed feed and rejecting a failed feed that can not be repaired. Directory driven – OSFE creates and maintains a specific set of directories for managing a feed file&#39;s complete life cycle to include where a feed may be downloaded, where is placed when it&#39;s being processed, where it is placed if the feed is failed and where it may be permanently archived.

<p>Go to top of page </p>

<p>Downloading and InstallingRequirementsPRIDE Converter requires Java 1.5 (or above), which you can download for free here. Most modern computers will have Java installed already, so first try to follow the instructions below to download and run PRIDE Converter before downloading Java. You only need the JRE version (and not the JDK version) to run PRIDE Converter. Unless your data is stored in, or can be converted to, one of the supported data formats, the software will unfortunately not be of much help. We are however working on extending the list of supported data formats. The current version has been tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Linux and Mac OS X, but should also work on other platforms. If you come across problems on your platform please let us know. Go to top of page </p>

<p>DownloadingFollow the download link, and download the latest version of PRIDE_Converter_vX.Y.zip (where X and Y represent the version of the software). Unzipping the file, creates the following directory structure: </p>

<p>  PRIDE_Converter_vX.Y
<br/>     PRIDEConverter-X.Y.jar
<br/>     Properties
<br/>          Contacts
<br/>          Instruments
<br/>          Protocols
<br/>          Samples
<br/>     libTo start the software, simply double-click the file named PRIDEConverter-X.Y.jar. If this fails, try to download and install Java 1.5 or above, as explained in the previous section. (The program can also be started from the command line using the following command: java -jar PRIDEConverter-X.Y.jar.) A PRIDE Converter icon that can be used for shortcuts linking to the program is also included in the zip file. </p>

<p>At start up you will be given the choice of importing the settings from any previously installed versions of PRIDE Converter. Simply follow the instructions to import your old settings and lists of instruments, contacts etc. Upgrading does not delete your previous installation, but when you have verified that you can run the new version without problems, you can manually remove the old version by deleting the given folders. </p>

<p>At the download page you will also find a zip file containing example data sets to test the converter. </p>

<p>Go to top of page </p>

<p>TroubleshootingDoes Not Start - If nothing happens when double clicking the PRIDE Converter jar file, the most likely cause is that you don&#39;t have Java installed. Download the latest version of Java  here and try again. (You only need the JRE version (and not the JDK version) to run PRIDE Converter.) Does Not Start II - If PRIDE Converter fails during start-up and you get the &quot;PRIDE Converter - Startup Failed&quot; message, a file called pride_converter.log will be created in your home directory. In this file you will find detailed information about why the program was not able to start. Does Not Start III - The most likely reason for the &quot;PRIDE Converter - Startup Failed&quot; message is that you have installed PRIDE Converter in a path containing special characters, i.e. [, %, æ, ø, å, etc. Move the converter to a different folder or rename the folder(s) causing the problem and try again. (On Linux PRIDE Converter also has to be run from a path not containing spaces). Does Not Start IV - Another reason for the &quot;PRIDE Converter - Startup Failed&quot; message could be that you have set the upper memory limit higher than your computer can handle (see points below).  General Error Diagnosis - In the Properties folder (see section above for the folder structure), there is a file called ErrorLog.txt. This file contains transcripts of any errors that the application has encountered, and can be very useful in diagnosing your problem. Memory Issues I - Big datasets can require a lot of memory. If the software unexpectedly fails on a big project, and the software mentions that it ran out of memory, you should try to give the program more memory. This can be done by editing the JavaOptions.txt file in the Properties folder (see section above for the folder structure). In this file, change the -Xmx768M option to a higher number (e.g., -Xmx1500M for a maximum of appr. 1.5GB of memory). Please note that on a 32-bit operating system you can not increase this value beyond 2000M. If increasing the memory settings does not solve your problem, or you don&#39;t enough memory available, e-mail a support request to the PRIDE team at the EBI: pride-support at ebi.ac.uk (replace at with @). Memory Issues II - Another memory related issue that can occur in rare cases is that the default Java stack size memory is not set high enough for a given dataset. If this happens an exception will be thrown and an error (java.lang.StackOverflowError) can be found in the ErrorLog.txt file. The solution is to increase the default stack size, which is done in the same manner as the point above, but this time by increasing the -Xss1M and -Xoss1M parameters. Try doubling both of the values until the problem disappears. Memory Issues III - If you get an out of memory error after using the converter to create multiple PRIDE XML files, it might help restarting the converter and try converting the last file again. If the problem persists try increasing the provided memory size as explained above. Memory Issues IV - In some rare cases increasing the maximum memory size may result in the converter not starting, even though you have more than enough memory available. (Please note that on a 32-bit operating system you can not increase the maximum memory beyond 2000M.) If you are using Windows it may help to increase the available virtual memory, but this is not recommended unless all other options have been tried. For Windows XP: Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Tab -&gt; Performance Panel, Settings -&gt; Advanced Tab -&gt; Virtual memory, Change.  Internet Connection - If you have problems connecting to the Ontology Lookup Service, first make sure that you are connected to the internet. Then check your firewall (and proxy) settings to see if they prevent PRIDE Converter from accessing the internet. If you are using a proxy server you need to add the proxy settings to the JavaOptions.txt file in the Properties folder (see section above for the folder structure). Add: &quot;-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy.domain.com&quot; and &quot;-Dhttp.proxyPort=3128&quot; to the end of this file (on two separate lines). Replace the name of the proxy host (and the proxy port if necessary), save the JavaOptions.txt file and start the converter again. If this does not solve your problem, or you are not using a proxy server, you (or your IT department) has to allow HTTP POST connections to the following URL: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/services/OntologyQuery. Miscellaneous - A rare issue/bug is that the converter sometimes (for unknown reasons and very rarely) halts after clicking the Convert! button in the last step. If this happens simply cancel the conversion by closing the progress dialog and restart the conversion. If the problem persists, try going back one step in the converter and then forward again before restarting the conversion. Problem Not Solved? Or Problem Not In List Above? - See Support.

<p>UpgradingWhen a new version of PRIDE Converter becomes available, existing users will be notified of this the next time they start the converter. Upgrading is done by downloading the latest version from the Download section, unzipping the file in a (preferably) empty folder, and then double clicking on the PRIDE_Converter_vX.Y.jar file. You will then get the chance to import your settings (instruments, contacts, etc) from the previously installed version of the converter. Simply follow the instructions to import all your old settings. Upgrading does not delete the older version of PRIDE Converter. But after making sure that the new version is working, you can safely delete the folder containing the old version. </p>

<p>Installing the new version in the same folder as the previously installed version can result in problems and is not recommended. </p>

<p>How to Submitt Data to PRIDEOnce the PRIDE XML file is created, there are currently two ways of submitting it to PRIDE: </p>

<p>Direct submission via the PRIDE web page: this submission path is only suitable for small submissions (files of up to 15 MB unzipped, corresponding to about 5 MB for zipped files). In order to make the submission, users will have to be registered in the PRIDE system and log-in, at which point a “Submit Data” option is made available in the left menu on the PRIDE website. For larger files, users are advised to first contact the PRIDE team at pride-support at ebi.ac.uk (replace at with @). A curator will then create a private directory for the user in the EBI FTP server and the user will be able to upload their files there confidentially. The restrictions on using the web interface are solely the result of potential problems in the HTTP protocol when uploading large files, as file size limitations are essentially non-existent for submission purposes. </p>

 title : The pride3 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository        for proteomics data. It has been developed to provide the proteomics community with a public repository for        protein and peptide identifications together with the evidence supporting these identifications.  </p>

<p>The original motivation behind its development was to provide a common data exchange format and repository to support proteomics literature publications. This remit has grown with PRIDE, with the hope that PRIDE will provide a reference set of tissue-based identifications for use by the community. The future development of PRIDE has become closely linked to HUPO PSI. In addition to identifications, PRIDE is able to capture details of post-translational modifications coordinated relative to the peptides in which they have been found. </p>

<p>This project builds the core API of PRIDE, comprising the relational database implementation, core Java API and XML schema. PRIDE3 is a re-write from the ground up to implement the new MzML and AnalysisXML PSI formats and incorporate new technologies to make PRIDE responsive and able to handle massive data sets.</p>

 title : The pyvfdman Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The current system is made up of numerous manual processes which together support: </p>

<p>      The application and approval associated with new members.       The production of the membership reports.       The maintenance of training subject listings/schedules.       The inventory checking and ordering of consumables. Fire department administrators use this information extensively for planning. This information is also used by the City Council or Board of Directors and timeliness of published information is important. The accuracy of the subject information is critical to other processing done at budget time and year end. </p>

<p>The current system lacks flexibility for growth, its data is difficult to synchronize, only one year’s records can be effectively maintained at a time, and many procedures must be done manually or in duplicate. These shortcomings have led to a decision to replace the current set of functionality with a new, integrated system that will also provide a solid infrastructure for future growth. </p>

<p>The proposed new management system will provide for the development, publishing, and sharing of information about department information in an integrated environment using modern technologies. It will provide the infrastructure to support state-of-the-art initiatives. The new system will resolve these problems in the current information systems: </p>

<p>The lack of secure, access-controlled support for sharing information among members, admin staff, and the City Council office during the development of new and changed proposals, The use of many manual procedures such as logging the receipt of members approvals, The use of hardcopy for training subject approvals, Inability to effectively maintain data for more than one year at a time Delays between approvals of new/changed purchase requests and purchase order release, The dependence upon out-dated manual record keeping, Inadequate technological support for record keeping activities. The new system will: </p>

<p>Replace the current out-dated set of processes and data stores with a new, integrated management system, Employ modern technologies (an environment using a database, a PC system, and a graphical user interface) Streamline the creation/maintenance of new and changed member, equipment and departmental records, Provide for up-to-date reports and enriched availability of related subject information. The volunteer fire community in general needs: </p>

<p>Accurate and accessible membership information, starting with up-to-date member listings, Accurate and accessible inventory information, starting with up-to-date inventory listings, Accurate and accessible call/run information, starting with up-to-date call/run listings, Easy access to information about training courses such as course subjects and schedules.

<p>Concrete Abstract: What You Can ExpectHere are a few short examples of what you can expect. The XENON library is the first application (or, specialization) of the more generic POD library; either can be imported from the shuttlepod package. Our focus is not so much on HTML processing, but on seeing what we can do with plain old dictionaries and a little help from a dictionary handling library. Let’s start by reading in a short text with some tags, and then work on them: </p>

<p>#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>from shuttlepod import XENON
<br/>from pprint import pprint as _pretty</p>

<p>#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/># some (defective) XMLish stuff:
<br/>source  = &quot;The Utmost&quot;
<br/>#...........................................................................................................
<br/># gets healed, parsed, and printed out as XMLish again:
<br/>pod     = XENON.parseOne( source )
<br/>print repr( XENON.toXml( pod ) )
<br/>This is the output: </p>

<p>u&quot;The Utmost&quot;
<br/>Now take a look under the hood. print pod yields this output: </p>

<p>{u&#39;%classes&#39;: [u&#39;hype&#39;, u&#39;label&#39;],
<br/> u&#39;@align&#39;:   u&#39;left&#39;,
<br/> u&#39;@foo&#39;:     u&#39;42&#39;,
<br/> u&#39;mid&#39;:      [u&#39;The Utmost&#39;],
<br/> u&#39;name&#39;:     u&#39;div&#39;,
<br/> u&#39;~isa&#39;:     u&#39;xenon.pod&#39;}
<br/>What we see is a plain old dictionary with keys like %classes, name, @foo, ~isa. Note that the names of all attributes of the tag have been prefixed with the sigil @ and that @class is missing, but there is a member %classes. Also, all texts are Unicode objects. We can investigate about the mysteriously missing @class; here are two ways to accomplish that: </p>

<p>print repr( XENON.getAClass( pod ) )
<br/>print repr( XENON.get( pod, &#39;@class&#39; ) )gives: </p>

<p>u&#39;hype label&#39;
<br/>u&#39;hype label&#39;We can see that both methods do the right thing. @class is only a virtual member of pod, and its value gets behind the scenes reconstructed from the value of %classes. – Next let’s do some class name juggling: </p>

<p>XENON.toggleClasses( pod, &#39;hype&#39; )
<br/>print repr( XENON.toXml( pod ) )</p>

<p>XENON.addClasses( pod, &#39;hype&#39;, &#39;good&#39;, &#39;hilite&#39; )
<br/>print repr( XENON.toXml( pod ) )</p>

<p>XENON.prependClasses( pod, &#39;good&#39;, &#39;hilite&#39; )
<br/>print repr( XENON.toXml( pod ) )gives: </p>

<p>u&quot;The Utmost&quot;
<br/>u&quot;The Utmost&quot;
<br/>u&quot;The Utmost&quot;################################################# ????????????????????????????????????????????????? The data is yours -- a dictionary is still a dictionary. If someone else comes up with another library that does what you need but XENON does not provide, you can use the methods of that library, and still keep the data. That is less true within the classical OOP approach, where you would have to re-instantiate the object that represents your structure, or subclass an XML-handling class. </p>

<p>Now for something slightly more involved – two nested tags: </p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </p>

<p>&#39;mid&#39; it’s all about mixed content </p>

<p>shuttlePODThe JSON data format (http://json.org, http://json.com) has gained wide appreciation in a short time. JSON’s outstanding key feature is that it provides a sound set of atomar and collective data types – texts, numbers, booleans, lists, dictionaries – that are (1) written out in a cross-language, no-nonsense style, and that (2) live as native objects in your native programming language, be it Python, JavaScript, Perl, or PHP. This sets JSON apart from XML, which has proven to be complicated and often impeding for the difficulty to get it seamlessly working in current programming languages. </p>

<p>With handling structured data, the need arises for facilities that support the most important data transformations in a painless way. shuttlePOD is a JSON handling library. Now, JSON being so generic, shuttlePOD aspires to go way beyond the #1 conceived use case for JSON – a serialization format for Ajax HTTP conversations. </p>

<p>It can already read from XML and serialize itself to XML, and first experiences have shown that it makes sense to do a lot of HTML handling chores (think templating, form data processing, dynamic web page building, web scraping) using shuttlepod.XENON library. </p>

<p>The name of this project, shuttlePOD, highlights two aspects: </p>

<p>shuttle stands for ‘mobility’. Build and handle any kind of structured data, and as long as you restrict yourself to Json’s Seven Sisters – string, number, object, array, true, false, null – you are at any point ready to transmit your object over the wire (HTTP, eMail, file). </p>

<p>POD  stands for Plain Old Dictionary (alias hash, associative array). Using named values is the cornerstone of building soundly structured data, and dictionaries excel at that. Dictionaries are the basic building block for classes and objects in object oriented programming (OOP). </p>

<p>shuttlePOD is currently being implemented in Python. The focus of development is on two libraries, POD for fully generic dictionary handling, and XENON, an application of the shuttlePOD paradigm to reading and writing X/HT/MLish (XML, HTML, XHTML) notations. </p>

<p>shuttlePOD is a data-centric library; this entails </p>

<p>a shift away from classical OOP, towards a more library-oriented, more generic style; a shift away from producing results as a direct result of imperative programming, towards producing results by using generic tools to ‘massage’ or transform input data into output data. When you transform data – and my experience is as a programmer you do that almost all of the time – you better use a data model that lends itself to be kneaded the way you need it to be, and you better use some good tools that cover all the general use cases. Transforming XML is, in part, so painful because XML sucks with all its arcane features you never need, because reifying an XML document as a DOM structure sucks in terms of ease of use, and writing XSLT sucks in terms of readability. Libraries like jQuery have flourished because expressions like $(&#39;#x123&#39;), $(&#39;.foobar&#39;) just let you forget all the hairy stuff that is hidden inside of HTML and the DOM. </p>

<p>The workflow of shuttlePOD when it comes to X/HT/ML handling may be summarized as follows: </p>

<p>Read in a snippet of XML or HTML. Just assume it makes sense and for the most part just repair what is broken (makes sense as a majority of the world’s websites use broken markup). Transform that into a JSON-compliant object, e.g. using shuttlePOD xenon. Inspect, transform, amend that structure. Pass that structure on to a consumer (e.g. a web scraper, a database model), or write it out as another wire format (text, CSV, HTML, PDF, image). Passing on a model may mean to pass the structure inside your Virtual Machine (VM, eg the Python interpreter), or to write it out as a JSON string to send it over HTTP. The functionality of shuttlePOD lives in libraries that handle generic dictionaries. This way, you do not have to instantiate any FooBar class before you are good to go – just call a method like POD.iterNames({&#39;@foo&#39;:42,&#39;@bar&#39;:108,&#39;blah&#39;:&#39;whatever&#39;},prefixes=&#39;@&#39;) et voilà. Throw any plain old dictionary at the library methods and they’ll do the chores. </p>

<p>In the future, shuttlePOD will also support to build objects that allow for classical OOP-style programming. The buzzword for that plan is Kata, Japanese for ‘form’, ‘matrix’, ‘mold’. You will have the possiblity to throw a dictionary at a factory function like kata=POD.getKata(pod) and be returned an object of an appropriate OOP class. The beautiful thing about this is that </p>

<p>the POD library knows how to get appropriate classes; Kata classes use the full power of libraries; in the ideal case, they can be defined in a wholly declarative way. – But that is the future. Advantages Of The Data-Centric, Library-Oriented ApproachBeing libraries, POD and XENON do not have state(#); all they do is inspect objects, transform objects, and build and return values. </p>

<p>(#) more precisely, libraries do not keep state on a per object basis, but a library can have library-wide settings that make it different from other libraries with the same implementation, but different configurations. Think of ‘configuration’ as ‘library state’. 
<br/>Some people will complain that writing XENON.toXml(pod) is ‘not OOP’, and they would be right. To a certain degree: the library is by design the point of method invocation, not the object being affected; we have to write L.do(a,x) instead of a.do(x). (It’s not that f(x) is ‘not OOP’ because ‘only x.f() is correct’, that would be ridiculous.) The library-oriented approach has several advantages (and a few caveats): </p>

<p>(1) Clear Separation of Functionality and DataData objects (PODs and other data types) remain pure data objects, and functionality objects remain pure functionality objects (without state). </p>

<p>Since state can’t be kept in a library, it must either be transient (be kept in an accompanying variable soon to be discarded) or else be kept in the POD itself. Putting the state in the POD means you can always say print pod to get a full account of state. When transmitting the object (say, to a web page or to serialize and persist it), you can do so at (almost) any point in time and never have to worry about serialization issues (read PEP307 if you want to know the meaning of this word). </p>

<p>(2) Automatic Name Mangling And Name-Based SpecialsUsing a data-centric library-oriented style of coding, we free ourselves from the naming conventions of the hosting language (Python in the case of shuttlePOD). You can’t have an attribute name like font-size if you want to write mystyle.font-size in Python, but you can state mystyle = { &#39;font-size&#39;: &#39;24pt&#39;, &#39;font-weight&#39;: &#39;bold&#39;, } to keep the CSS data and then say POD.get( mystyle, &#39;font-size&#39; ) to retrieve it. There is actually a good deal of names management &amp;mangling at work inside the POD library(#) that makes sure you can say POD.getFontSize(mystyle) and so on to deal with font-size, if you prefer to have it that way. </p>

<p>(#) i originally wrote we don’t do name mangling in shuttlePOD, but that’s plain wrong – and let’s hope that name mangling doesn’t get too magic). 
<br/>Non-generic libraries like XENON also can define ‘handlers’, that is, methods that do more than just getting and setting values. As a case in point, when you get or set the member @class in a dictionary using the XENON X/HT/ML library, what happens behind the scenes is that values are understood as whitespace-separated lists of words and internally tucked away as %classes. This means you are freed of having to deal with the details of CSS class name handling. The example near the top of this page tells it all. </p>

<p>(3) Avoidance Of Namespace PollutionGranted the examples above are a little more wordy than plain snappy OOP – fact is you will run into difficulties any time you want to map a problem domain’s naming conventions to Python or JavaScript. You will have to do name mangling and change that font-size to fontSize. Granted also that Python somewhat culturally favors to write system-level attributes as a.attr and user-level data items as a[&#39;item&#39;], but again fact is people almost always strive to map SQL table names, CSS style rules and so on to a a.attr style of access, partly because of the terser syntax. Some of that mapping business goes well, some of it does not. The riding starts to get rough when you have both a table foobar and an unrelated attribute foobar and you are never sure which is which when doing mydb.foobar. The reason for this problem is called namespace pollution, and you should avoid that. </p>

<p>(4) Avoidance Of OOP BoilerplateI find a lot of my time – too much of it – goes into designed the ever-same never-changing very basic design things into my custom OOP model classes. How is this supposed to print. How do i access instance data. How do i initialize the little bugger. And so on. How many classes i have designed over the years that allow me to do the foo.bar trick to get me foo[&#39;bar&#39;] i cannot count. Using shuttlePOD, much of that just vanishes like it’s never been there. And i don’t look back. </p>

<p>(5) Sigils Are Namespace PrefixesMy proposal to avoid namespace pollution and achieve a clear, yet readable and serializable structuring of data involves sigils, also called namespace prefixes. As such, sigils are not a new idea – for example, in Python you use __init__ and __contains__ as names to indicate the special status of methods, or _frob to indicate ‘this item is private and not part of the public API’. Read NamespacePrefixes for more. </p>

<p>(6) Data Type MarkupData can be easily marked up for type by using ~isa. </p>

<p>(7) Data Type ModellingData types not among the Seven Sisters can be modelled using the core data types, and the core facility to achieve that are, you guessed it, dictionaries. For example, to define a set, we could choose to write </p>

<p>myset = { &#39;~isa&#39;: &#39;set.pod&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;: True, &#39;bar&#39;: True, &#39;baz&#39;: True, }
<br/>that is use a dictionary with nonce values to represent a set. How about a lexicon (an ordered dictionary)? Here it is: </p>

<p>mylexicon = {
<br/>  &#39;~isa&#39;:       &#39;lexicon.pod&#39;,
<br/>  &#39;~sorting&#39;:   [&#39;bar&#39;,&#39;foo&#39;,&#39;baz&#39;,],
<br/>  &#39;foo&#39;:        42,
<br/>  &#39;bar&#39;:        108,
<br/>  &#39;baz&#39;:        3, }
<br/>It all hinges on the libraries being able to recognize and deal with objects that are marked as set.pod, lexicon.pod and so on. </p>

<p>OBS: Beyond doubt, some thinking has to go into (1) naming types and (2) type handling library retrieval. We are liberally using designations like lexicon.pod, car.pod, set.pod here; these are meant as mere illustrations. Later work will clarify and regularize things.</p>
 title : The slofs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?SloFS (pronounced slow-FS) is a quick and dirty, mostly POSIX conforming, read/write filesystem API on top of SQLite. The purpose is to simply provide an alternative to various tiny-domain formats for data storage, much like zziplib does, but with the added ability to write to the data store. </p>

<p>Why?Why not? During development of the pm password management tool, the authors found it necessary to have an open format, easy to read data file. Originally YAML was chosen for its terse and easy to write and debug data format -- unfortunately, the C libraries for parsing such a data structure are too painful. After considering other options, they finally came across zziplib. Realizing that their data format was just a simple set of strings and that reading and writing to a filesystem were simple and well-defined algorithms already, the authors set out to start using this library instead. Unfortunately, they realized that zziplib is a read only API to zip files, and finally came up with the crazy idea of implementing a complete filesystem on top of a very lightweight SQL database. SloFS was the result of their discussion and research. </p>

<p>SloFS -- It&#39;s not stupid, it&#39;s just slow.</p>

 summary : <p>The data on your website is stored in SQLite.  Its the kind of data where you don&#39;t really need to provide an API as much as get it to people in formats they can open and read.  SQLiteDownloader is a php file that can export SQLite databases as xls, xlsx, csv, sql, or pass through the raw database.  Support for ods is planned soon (relies on another package that can only do one sheet = one table, working a mod for more than one sheet = all the tables of the database).</p>
 title : The structorian Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Structorian is a tool which lets you describe formats of binary data in a powerful C-like language, and then view or edit the data in a structured view. The process of describing the data format is interactive - you can modify the data structure definitions right as you are viewing the data.</p>

<p>Potential uses of Structorian are reverse-engineering games, network protocols and document file formats. It can be also used as a reference tool when writing code for working with data in known and documented formats.</p>

<p>The main goal of the Structorian project is to be for data what IDA (Interactive Disassembler) is for code.</p>

<p>Structorian is written in C# 2.0 and should run under both Microsoft .NET Framework and Mono.</p>
 title : The swloot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Rolls for loot in World of Warcraft.  Stormwardens makes use of a form of Roll-for-interest system that calls for both need and greed rolls, with each member being allowed one &#39;priority&#39; need roll per instance.  This addon keeps track of which members have used their needs, and automates the basic roll system. </p>

<p>Release NotesThe current release (r76) removes the raid roll functionality.  This has been moved to OpenRolls (also a featured download).  The general interface remains largely unchanged. </p>

<p>Also: what is the deal with the question mark up there? I fixed it. Talk to me later about it. -govtgeek </p>

<p>Rudimentary DocumentationAll tasks are handled via the command line. </p>

<p>Initial Set up/swloot raid start  </p>

<p>This command begins tracking the raid </p>

<p>.   must be unique and is case sensitive.  If  is omitted, will resume tracking the last known raid. </p>

<p>/swloot raid stop </p>

<p>Stops tracking the raid. </p>

<p>Rolling Loot/swloot roll  </p>

<p>/swloot award </p>

<p>Line one starts the roll. Line two awards the loot to whoever the mod believes won the roll. You provide an actual item link (as gotten by shift-clicking the item in the loot window); actual names of items without a link are rejected. </p>

<p>Graphical InterfaceWhen you loot an item at or above the current loot threshold, a series of windows will also open providing an interface to the above functions.  &quot;Need&quot; and &quot;Greed&quot; begin rolls for the specified loot, the results of which are filled in automatically.  The returned values can be changed manually if so desired.  Clicking &quot;Award&quot; actually awards the item. </p>

<p>Each item maintains its own winner, so rolling multiple items do not clear previous winners like happens when using the command line interface.  However, this information is lost when the loot window closes. </p>

<p>Advanced functions/swloot loot direct    </p>

<p>Used if the mod is wrong for whatever reason, so you can circumvent the roll mechanism all together. The last option is need/greed; if omitted, a need is not used. </p>

<p>/swloot loot need    </p>

<p>Used if somebody rolled need, but you decided to grant it as a greed roll. Or vice versa.   is true/false; if true, </p>

<p>&#39;s need roll is taken away.  If false, the need is given back.  If omitted, the status toggles. </p>

<p>/swloot greed  </p>

<p>Used if you want to skip the need portion of the roll. Still only provides a 5-second roll window.  </p>

<p>/swloot loot disqualify  </p>

<p>Used to disqualify a specific roller.  If performed while a roll is taking place, the addon will behave as normal and &#39;award&#39; can be used.  If the roll has finished, the new winner will be printed to chat, but &#39;loot direct&#39; must be used to award the loot as &#39;award&#39; will not be sure how to behave. </p>

<p>/swloot summarize  </p>

<p>Prints details for the current raid to the chat. Details include all loot awarded by the addon (via either &#39;award&#39; or &#39;loot direct&#39;...loot distributed via raid rolls et cetera are not tracked), and which players have used needs. </p>

<p>Synchronization/swloot synchronize    </p>

<p>Sends your loot information to another player. This communication is bidirectional, such that afterwards both player&#39;s will have the same information.  You must be on </p>

<p>&#39;s trusted list (see below) to synchronize.   does not need to be on your own trusted list. </p>

<p>/swloot trusted add   </p>

<p>/swloot trusted remove   </p>

<p>Controls who you will synchronize with. Synchronization requests from players not on this list will be ignored. </p>

<p>Debug Functionality/swloot debug verbose </p>

<p>Toggles printing of additional information when performing raid summaries.  </p>

<p>/swloot debug summarize </p>

<p>Prints a summary that only you can see </p>

<p>/swloot debug output  </p>

<p>Controls who can see output from the addon.  </p>

<p> can be &quot;Raid&quot;, &quot;Party&quot;, or &quot;Chat&quot;.  &quot;Raid&quot; is the default value and results in everybody seeing the information; &quot;Party&quot; limits it to members of your own party; &quot;Chat&quot; limits it to just your screen.  Note that this only modifies public information; data that would normally be private remains private regardless of this value.</p>
 title : The swx-format Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SWX is the native data format for Flash. Data is stored as SWF bytecode (you can&#39;t get more native than that on the Flash Platform) that is interpreted by the Flash Player. The SWX format is a subset of the SWF format (just like JSON is a subset of JavaScript). </p>

<p>With ActionScript 3 support, SWX provides you with custom events which are dispatched when your data is received, and it is available for use immediately. Using ActionScript 2, you can loadMovie() SWX data files and they are ready to use the moment they are loaded. When using either language you don&#39;t need to deserialize or massage the data in any way before using it as it is stored in native Flash objects. </p>

 title : The towel-db Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>toweldbAbouttoweldb is an extremely simple two-dimensional database library currently only available for Python.  It has been designed for data integrity over performance by using a simple textual data storage format so that it can be easily repaired by hand if needed.  It is primarily aimed at usages where a search delay is preferable to a broken database (i.e. package managers). </p>

<p>StatusCurrently, toweldb 0.8.1 is available.  It&#39;s a proof-of-concept written in Python, and has more than a couple bugs.  The pure-python approach has since been discontinued in favor of a library written in C, which is under heavy development and will be released as 0.9. </p>

<p>RationaleRaw speed is, in most cases, not a concern for &quot;real world&quot; programs.  As processor and disk performance rises, the usage of a binary database format begins to be of questionable value for most use cases.  A binary format is also harder to debug, and cannot be easily repaired in the case of a system crash or just a bug in the database library itself.  A textual format, however, sacrifices performance for data stability.  Thus, the goal of toweldb is to provide a database library with a data storage engine more powerful than standard configuration file formats, while still offering the integrity possible in such formats.</p>
 title : The twxproxy-ep Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TWX Proxy is a Trade Wars 2002 helper program designed to assist experienced players of the game in their &#39;art&#39;. Unlike most other helpers, the idea of this program is to simply provide a sidelined assistance in the game rather than directing its play.   This project also includes several subprojects that look to take the same proxy design to the server-side.  The first such subproject, TWX BBS, provides a server-side proxy for sysops to script unique games for their players. </p>

<p>HistoryTWX Proxy started life as a commercial product by Xide, but was later released as Open Source under the GPL2 license in 2005.  Development has resumed in this branch of the TWX Proxy project.  Originally, there were several forks of TWX Proxy, however, at this time, this branch, known as ElderProphet&#39;s version, is the only actively developed project. </p>

<p>GoalsThis project aims to produce: </p>

<p>A client-side helper for traditional TradeWars players A set of server and client-side tools to provide a better environment for casual gamers </p>

<p>Since we are building on the stable TWX Proxy, the helper is stable and ready for use.  The second goal is one that is in the early design and implementation phases. </p>

Pages are written in an xml/xhtml dialect, rich of build-in tags made to loop through a result-set, show data in a variety of ways, easily navigate the db structure, reuse xml snippets, and so on. All of the application logic resides in pure php files, that can be used to manage lots and lots of xml-page-definitions with the same abstract logic, adding separation between application-logic and presentation. This version includes AJAX support via the (gorgeous) prototype library. </p>

<p>ubk è un framework che permette agli sviluppatori di costruire rapidamente applicazioni orientate alla gestione dati. Le pagine sono scritte in un dialetto di xml, ricco di tag fatti per ciclare su un result-set, visualizzare i dati in vari modi, &quot;vascare&quot; facilmante la struttura del db, riutilizzare parti di codice xml, e via dicendo. Tutta la logica applicativa risiede in file php puri, che possono essere utilizati per gestire molti file xml che condividano la stessa logica di funzionamento, fornendo quindi la separazione fra logica applicativa e presentazione. Questa versione include il supporto per AJAX attraverso la (fantastica) libreria prototype.</p>
