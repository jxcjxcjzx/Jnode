 title : The AltDrag Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AltDrag gives you the ability to move and resize your windows in a new way. After you have started the program, you can simply hold down the Alt key and then click and drag any window. Besides just moving windows, you can resize, maximize and close them too. AltDrag simply allows you to do more with less mouse movements.</p>

<p>This behavior already exists in the window managers of Linux and other operating systems, and AltDrag was made with the mission to copy that behavior to the Windows platform. I believe I have succeeded with this and even added a lot of new functionality that makes your everyday computing a little easier.</p>

 title : The awn-plugins Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis project was started to have a seperate project space for plugins related to avant-window-navigator. Most plugins are actually plugins for other applications, like the gaim plugin by mycroes. Any avant-window-navigator plugin is welcome, the more developers that want to help, the more users we can serve. </p>

<p>Pluginsgaim_awn </p>

<p>gaim_awn is a plugin for Gaim that will make the icon in AWN behave in a similar way to the docklet gaim has. Large pieces of code that are in the first revisions is just ported over from the gaim docklet, but as AWN advances there will be more features that currently don&#39;t seem to exist on any other OS or in any other task list. You can download a binary version of this plugin at the downloads page or you can compile yourself with the source that&#39;s in svn. </p>

<p>Exaile_awnExaile_awn is a plugin for Exaile that shows album art for the song playing in Exaile. You can find this plugin on the Downloads page. </p>

<p>pidgin_awnpidgin_awn is a forked version of gaim_awn. Because gaim won&#39;t be developed anymore, mycroes decided to copy the code, apply changes necessary to work with pidgin and start from there. The plugin differs from gaim_awn in that it uses the status icons from pidgin, instead of the tray icons gaim_awn used. Because of this there are just a few states and the connecting state is represented by the log-in icon. If in the future larger icons become available for the systray icon this behaviour might get reverted to the way it works in gaim_awn. Besides this change, pidgin_awn also displays the unread message count on the pidgin icon if there are any unread messages. You can get pidgin_awn from the Downloads section</p>

 title : The cachegrindvisualizer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CachegrindVisualizerCachegrindVisualizer is a visualizer for xdebug profiling data (cachegrind compatible file), i. e. frontend for Cachegrind (part of Valgrind). Supports OS: Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista Home and Ultimate Edition, Mac OS 10.4.7 and above (Intel and PowerPC), Mac OS X Leopard. </p>

<p>Example </p>

<p>All examples in Russian or in English. </p>

<p>Screenshot </p>

<p>ОписаниеCachegrindVisualizer — это кроссплатформенная программа для визуализации файлов в формате Callgrind, в частности, его подмножества используемого Cachegrind. Профайлер Xdebug является совместимым с Cachegrind. </p>

<p>CachegrindVisualizer строит граф в формате DOT, который с помощью Graphviz можно преобразовать в 18 других форматов (VRML не поддерживается), в том числе, в SVG — самое вкусное. Сам CachegrindVisualizer не визуализирует формат DOT, для просмотра графа как изображения вам необходимо самостоятельно преобразовать его в нужный вам формат. Для удобства работы рекомендую использовать просмотровщик — ничего лучше чем ZGRViewer под Windows я не нашел. </p>

<p>Построение графа происходит автоматически после анализа, изменения настроек или выделения ветки дерева, сам граф располагается там же, где и исходный файл профилирования, с тем же именем, но с раширением dot. Граф можно строить как для всей системы в целом, так и для любой из ее подсистем — выделением соответствующей ветки дерева. Настроить, какой каталог содержит файлы профилирования для использования его по умолчанию в диалоге &quot;Открыть&quot;, нельзя — каталогом по умолчанию считается тот, откуда в последний раз брался файл. Настройки построения графа можно сохранять и загружать. Имя вкладки это имя анализируемого файла с удалением &quot;cachegrind.out.&quot;. </p>

<p>При анализе осуществляется корректировка записей о деструкторах — xdebug пишет их так, как оно есть и как оно зависит от внутренних механизмов PHP — но обычному смертному PHP-программисту этих подробностей знать не надо и CachegrindVisualizer в независимости от того, как была завершена программа — сама или ей помогли (например, exit) или был ли присвоен инстанцированный класс какой-либо переменной, размещает эти записи в ветке main, и, таким образом, у вас всегда дерево, а не лес. </p>

<p>Пиктограммы для токенов были взяты из шаблона phpDocumentor earthli и доработаны для прозрачности (разделять на ветка/лист не стал — рябит в глазах). В отличие от WinCacheGrind встроенные классы PHP я считаю не функцией, то есть php::blitz-&gt;blitz будет иметь пиктограмму конструктора, а php::blitz-&gt;set пиктограмму метода. Пиктограмма для программы в розыске ;) </p>

<p>Кто работал во flex приложениях, учтите, что все использованные управляющие элементы доработаны для нормального использования: Tree и DataGrid знают о щелчке в пустом месте для снятия выделения; Tree, DataGrid и List поддерживают Ctrl + A; NumericStepper поддерживает колесо мыши и корректно устанавливает курсор ввода; TextInput поддерживает Ctrl + Z/Y.</p>

<p>项目最新更新 CHTML 项目组和草泥马编程语言已经达成谅解备忘, 互相推动彼此发展, 推进马勒戈壁信息化产业的发展, 三年内开创戈壁上的新硅谷.  CHTML 项目组推荐使用 草泥马 编程语言作为标准内嵌脚本语言. 详情请访问草泥马语言官方网站:  http://code.google.com/p/grass-mud-horse/ </p>

<p>CHTML 安全漏洞警号001号: 尊敬的用户请注意, 所有用汉编编写的脚本都有很高的风险被注入蠕虫, 导致您的计算机红屏, 显示中国国旗. 请向我们项目组报告您遭受的攻击.  海内外媒体热议 CHTML 标准推出是中文互联网重大突破 网民纷纷发贴祝贺 CHTML 标准草案胜利颁布 新版本标签任前公示 一个已知的服务器故障已经修复, 用户可顺利下载DTD. 请点击此 http://chtml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chtml.dtd </p>

<p>简介CHTML 是一种超文本标记语言. 它顺应汉语编程的历史潮流, 允许中国的互联网开发者发布信息到万维网上使用中文的字符作为标签. 比如 </p>

<p>五大三粗 和 东倒西歪 </p>

<p>详细介绍CHTML 是国际互联网组织 W3C 超文本标记语言 4.0 的一个实现. 是在汉语编程光辉思想的指导下, 互联网普遍协议与中国国情相结合的产物. 和汉语编程一样, 原来使用英文的标签现在可以全部使用中文; 除此之外, 还额外扩展了两个标签, 即  和 . 除此以外, 该协议和现有 HTML 标准完全兼容. 目前 CHTML 的版本是零点零一.  </p>

<p> 是和中国国情结合的产物. 有时候我们需要创建只有一个答案的投票, 此标签即可用于及时丢弃用户投票, 节省服务器资源, 彰显社会主义优越性.  </p>

<p> 是著名的 CAPTCHA 系统的浏览器实现. 所以在此标签中的元素都变成 CAPTCHA 从而人可以顺利阅读, 而机器不能. 目前的实现有两个, 一个是由 CMU 构建的 reCAPTCHA 文字自动转系统, 另一种是由中国网民发起的竖起来的文字系统. 此标签对人和搜索引擎都无害, 但可以透明飞跃长城. 技术细节还在讨论当中. </p>

<p>为便于中文开发者理解含义, 其他标签也按照中文互联网的特色做了相应的定义. 如,  变成 ，  变成 ，更多的细节可以参见这个 中文文档.  我们的新版本也在紧锣密鼓的开发中, 请各界群众查看我们新版本中部分标签的 任前公示  </p>

<p>已知实现我们正在工作在一个火狐狸的实现, 而且已经要完成了基本上, 并且可以让火狐狸直接呈现 CHTML 页面. 对不起微软的用户, 因为我们没有得到任何英特网探险家的超文本解析库的授权, 按照新千禧年数字法案, 我们的工程师不能加 CHTML 的支持通过反向工程. 我们感到很抱歉为此.  </p>

<p>竖排文字是  标签已知的一个实现, 在新版本 CHTML 的协议 中, 你可以使用   内容  飞跃功夫网.  其他的反功夫网方法正在紧张开发中.  </p>

<p>在我们的代码库里面, 已经有一个 蟒蛇编程语言 的分析器, 验证器的实现和一个火狐狸的超文本解析器的实现.  </p>

<p>为了方便我们的开发人员，代码库里面还有一个面向 Textmate 的 Bundle.  您使用Textmate 实作编写 CHTML 非常节省能量. </p>

<p>问题和答案 此项目和谷歌有关系吗? </p>

<p>虽然此项目放在谷歌代码上但它是纯粹由中国人自发发起的项目.  中国人的事情中国人自己办, 我们绝不容许谷歌或者其它任何组织机构染指她. </p>

<p>你也可以 创建项目 这里在谷歌代码上免费. </p>

<p> 因为这是一个中国人的项目, 他有中文名字么?  </p>

<p>是的, 他的名字在中文叫 &quot;中文版如何做爱&quot; 他是 CHTML 的全写: Chinese How To Make Love.  </p>

<p> 我怎么告诉我的浏览器我正在使用的是CHTML呢?  </p>

<p>谢谢你精彩的问题, 这很简单. 就加 </p>

<p>AboutCHTML is a brand new markup language that allows Chinese developers to publish contents on World Wide Web by using tags in Chinese characters, such as bold and italic </p>

<p>WTF is CHTML exactly?CHTML is an implementation of W3C&#39;s HTML 4.0 except that all tags are now written in Chinese such as  . It has extension tags that support the anti-censorship such as  and . It&#39;s complied with XML and other known W3C language specifications except two tags:  and  </p>

<p>#  is used in the situation that there is no democratic election in China. Therefore, the implementation of  in any HTML specification is illegal in China.  (in Chinese 勾) is designed and aims to be used as an alternative such that you can vote. (you thought you can vote but you can not, this tag will discard the vote under any circumstance). </p>

<p>#  is actually an implementation of the famous CAPTCHA system. All the words embedded are converted into CAPTCHA so that human can read it smoothly while the censorship system (we guess it is actually a computer) can&#39;t detect that. (Unless they can break the CAPTCHA system).  </p>

<p># Other tags are redefined in the context of Chinese Internet. For instance,  now becomes  and  becomes  </p>

<p>Known implementations:Currently we are working on an implementation on Firefox. Sorry M$ user, since we don&#39;t have the library of IE and can&#39;t recompile the HTML parser library, we currently don&#39;t support IE.  </p>

<p>You can checkout the python CHTML parser as well as a library extension of Firefox in the SVN repository.  </p>

<p>Q&amp;A Since it&#39;s a Chinese project, does it have a Chinese name?  </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s Chinese name is 中文版如何做爱. It means How To Make Love in Chinese.  </p>

<p> How can I tell my browser I am using CHTML instead of HTML? </p>

<p>Thank you for the excellent question. It&#39;s very easy. Just add </p>

<p>`&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD CHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/chtml/DTD/chtml.dtd&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/chtml/DTD/chtml.dtd&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&gt;` </p>

<p>to the first line of your HTML.  </p>

<p>Due to the poor quality of Google, this file might be 404 some times. However, it would be highly appreciated if you can donate us a server or some money via paypal.  </p>

<p> Can you show me some examples about this fantastic project? </p>

<p>Yes, you can check the supported Chinese tags .  </p>

<p>We also provide a example page for beginners in CHTML.  </p>

<p>You might wonder to know the actual result of our project, here are some screenshots </p>

 title : The collisiondetectionkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>--NOTICE-- </p>

<p>A new version of the CDK is now available! Updates have been made based on user feedback, as well as overall code optimization. Download the new CDK v1.5 and enjoy these changes: </p>

<p>- &quot;overlap&quot; property in the checkCollisions() returned array has been replaced by &quot;overlapping&quot;.  The new overlapping property is an array of all the pixels that were overlapping in the collision, given to you in stage coordinates.  Now you can know exactly where your collisions are happening as well as by how much. </p>

<p>- You no longer need to have display objects on the stage to detect for collisions!  Use the CDK in your blitting engines and experience the added speed benefits of detecting for collisions off the stage with the CDK.  Works with objects on the stage colliding against objects off the stage.  The display list simply doesn&#39;t matter anymore! </p>

<p>- Transformations made on parent display objects are now accounted for.  Do whatever you want to your container sprites without fear of it messing with your collision detection. </p>

<p>- Code optimizations have led to ~15% in speed improvements overall. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re already using the CDK, I strongly encourage you to get this new version. Please note that the package name has changed, and now resides at com.coreyoneil.collision </p>

<p>Enjoy!  And as always, if you use the CDK in a project, feel free to let me know.  The CDK has had over 2500 downloads so far, and I love hearing about the cool things devs are using this for.  :) </p>

<p>--/NOTICE-- </p>

<p>The Collision Detection Kit is a package of classes created for pixel-precise, shape-based collision detection for all display objects. It is written in Actionscript 3.0 and meant for Flash Player version 9 and higher. The Collision Detection Kit comes with several features to control how collisions are detected, and provides data for the user of the class so they can do something about the collision: </p>

<p>Set an alpha threshold to ignore colors below the threshold. Specify colors and color ranges to exclude from collision detection. Receive an angle of collision for each collision. We&#39;re not talking about bounding boxes here - the angle is calculated based on the shapes of the display objects at the site of the collision. Great for when you&#39;re working with physics! Receive the pixels that overlapped in a collision in stage coordinates. Combined with the returned angle, and your physics engine will have no problems traversing complicated shapes or performing off-axis rotation. Takes transformations (scale, rotation, color transforms, etc.) of individual instances of your display objects into account. Add items for collision detection regardless of their nesting. You can have as many CollisionGroup and CollisionList instances as you want, allowing you to easily manage different interactions and behaviors. Works with all display objects - MovieClips, Sprites, Bitmaps, TextFields, FLVs, and on and on! To learn more about this package and how to use it, please reference the links for examples and documentation. </p>

 summary : <p>The Digg Toolbar for Firefox lets you Digg, submit content, and keep track of Digg even when you&#39;re not on the Digg site itself. With a notification window built into the toolbar, you&#39;ll never miss a popular story or when friends Digg, submit, or comment on stories. </p>

<p>Using the ToolbarWhen you&#39;re browsing the web, the toolbar will let you know if a story has already been submitted to Digg and, if it has, how many Diggs and comments it got. If the page you&#39;re viewing isn&#39;t already on Digg, the toolbar will display a submit button, which will help you easily submit the story to Digg and share it with the entire Digg community. It&#39;s even easy to hide the toolbar; if you don&#39;t want to see it, simply click on the Digg guy in the navigation bar, and it will be hidden. </p>

<p>Latest Popular ContentThe toolbar will alert you when new stories become popular on Digg by showing the story details in a small notification window at the bottom of the browser. And don&#39;t worry, you can control whether to see all recently popular stories or just those from the topics and media types you care about. </p>

<p>Follow Your FriendsA great way to discover the best content is to see what your friends are doing on Digg. Enter your Digg username in the settings window to receive notifications when you friends Digg, submit, or comment on stories. To go back and look at earlier notifications, click the Digg icon at the status bar at the bottom of the browser. All notifications can also be snoozed if you want to temporarily turn them off. </p>

 title : The googleearth-autohotkey Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a collection of tools for working with Google Earth, reading/modifying coordinates, converting between different format coordinates, saving the current Google Earth position to JPEG files as Exif GPS data etc. </p>

<p>ProgramsGoogle Earth PositionA tiny program for reading coordinates from the Google Earth client (or editing coordinates to make Google Earth fly to a new location). </p>

<p> 
<br/>The Copy buttons are intended to be useful for pasting coordinates and LookAt parameters into a spreadsheet, for example when generating KML using Google&#39;s Spreadsheet Mapper 2.0 
<br/>Latest version: 1.12 </p>

<p>Download: GoogleEarthPosition.exe </p>

<p>Google Earth PhotoTagA small program for adding Exif GPS data to JPEG files and reading coordinates from the Google Earth client. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>With the Auto-Mode enabled any new file drag-and-dropped onto the PhotoTag window will automatically be tagged with the current coordinates from the Google Earth client. 
<br/>Latest version: 1.21 </p>

<p>Download: GoogleEarthPhotoTag.exe </p>

<p>The program requires the Exiv2.exe command line tool by Andreas Huggel which can be downloaded (for free) from http://www.exiv2.org/ </p>

<p>The options to read/write Exif GPS data can be added to the windows right-click menu for JPEG files (click on the button in the About: dialog to add these options into the registry). 
<br/> 
<br/>The program can write KML output for showing a collection of photos inside Google Earth, like in this screenshot: </p>

<p> 
<br/>To edit the style of the popup balloon edit the *.PlacemarkStyle files in the same directory as the executable. Any files with a .PlacemarkStyle extension will automatically show up on the Placemark style dropdown list in the PhotoTag program window. </p>

<p>The program will include photo comments from descript.ion files or JPEG embedded comments in the placemark balloons. JPEG Comments or descriptions can also be edited in the PhotoTag GUI (configure which type to edit using the right-click menu; JPEG comments are stored inside the file itself so will stay with the file when you move/copy it, descript.ion comments are kept in a separate file and are faster to read/store, but not understood by all programs). </p>

<p>LatLong ConversionA tiny program for converting coordinates between Degree Minute Second and Decimal formats. </p>

<p> 
<br/>The tool can handle the following DMS formats: 
<br/>8 deg 32&#39; 54.73&quot; South	119 deg 29&#39; 28.98&quot; East 8°32&#39;54.73&quot;S, 119°29&#39;28.98&quot;E 8:32:54S,119:29:28E Decimal coordinates are in the format: 
<br/>-8.548333, 119.491383 Latest version: 1.07 </p>

<p>Download: LatLongConversion.exe </p>

<p>SourceThese programs are written in the AutoHotkey language (http://www.autohotkey.com) </p>

<p>The source code for the programs can be downloaded from the Google Code source tab. There is also a library file libGoogleEarth.ahk which includes the following functions: </p>

<p>Converting Coordinates Deg2Dec() - convert from 8°32&#39;54.73&quot;S, 119°29&#39;28.98&quot;E into -8.548333, 119.491383 Dec2Deg() - vice versa Dec2Rel() - convert into 0/1 55/1 5617/100, 78/1 36/1 2061/10 format (useful for raw Exif GPS data) Google Earth functions IsGErunning() - simple check to see if the Google Earth client is running GetGEpos() - get the current Google Earth coordinates and LookAt camera info using the COM API GetGEpoint() - get the current Google Earth coordinates and altitude using the COM API SetGEpos() - fly the Google Earth client to a specific coordinate FlyToPhoto() - fly the Google Earth client to the coordinate stored in a JPG file GEtimePlay() - start playing timeslider animation (useful when recording movies as GE Pro hides time control) GEtimePause() - stop playing timeslider animation JPEG Exif, Exif GPS, XMP tag and JPEG Comment functions GetPhotoLatLong() - read the Exif GPS Latitude/Longitude stored in a JPG file GetPhotoLatLongAlt() - read the Exif GPS Latitude/Longitude/Altitude stored in a JPG file SetPhotoLatLong() - write Exif GPS Latitude/Longitude data to a JPG file SetPhotoLatLongAlt() - write Exif GPS Latitude/Longitude/Altitude data to a JPG file ErasePhotoLatLong() - delete the Exif GPS Latitude/Longitude/Altitude data from a JPG file GetExif() - read full Exif data from a JPG file !GetJPEGComment() - read JPEG embedded comment !SetJPEGComment() - write JPEG embedded comment SetXmpTag() - read JPEG file XMP tags GetXmpTag() - write JPEG file XMP tags Other ImageDim() - return image dimensions (uses ImageMagick identify.exe) FileDescription() - read file description from descript.ion file WriteFileDescription() - write file description to descript.ion file captureOutput() - capture output from console command line (uses cmdret.dll if available) </p>

<p>The JPEG Exif functions require the Exiv2.exe command line tool by Andreas Huggel. It can be downloaded at http://www.exiv2.org/ (GPL 2+ license) </p>

<p>The Google Earth COM API functions requires the Embedded Windows Scripting and COM for Autohotkey library (ws4ahk.ahk) from http://www.autohotkey.net/~easycom/ </p>

<p>The JPEG Exif functions will optionally use cmdret.dll if present (removing the need for temp files while capturing command output)  http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic3687.html (already bundled in GoogleEarthPhotoTag) </p>

<p>Further information about the Google Earth COM API can be found here: http://earth.google.com/comapi/ </p>

<p>These programs are distributed without any warranty. The functions for writing to JPEG files can probably be considered safe as they rely the Exiv2 command line tool for file write access (and all writes in the PhotoTag program are verified by a read operation afterwards). However, do make sure there is a backup of all files before using these programs.</p>

 summary : <p>The GPX viewer is a 100% client-side JavaScript GPX file viewer that uses Google Maps to map waypoints and tracklogs. </p>

<p>GPX files are a standard GPS data format that is supported by many software applications.  It is an XML based data format which lends itself nicely to being parsed in JavaScript. </p>

<p>Since it is written entirely in JavaScript, this script can be added to any web page with minimal effort and little or no server code.  Just copy a GPX file to your web site, make a web page with an embedded Google Map, include the script, and initialize it. </p>

<p>This script is meant to be customized to some extent.  The default formatting for Waypoints is to show the available GPS data, but since it is Javascript, you can easily customize it to suite your needs.</p>

<p>View your iGoogle (formerly known as Google Personalized Home page) modules in the sidebar with an optimized layout. </p>

<p>This extension was inspired by a tip posted by Erica Joy on her blog. </p>

<p>Erica suggests to create a bookmark to your Google Personalized Home page and to open it in the sidebar using a built-in feature of Firefox. </p>

<p>This trick works great - or at least it did worked great until either Google changed the code of the page or the new Firefox 1.5.0.6 changed the actual layout, making it unusable (squeezed 3 times horizontaly). </p>

<p>This extension aims at reproducing the feature initially described in the trick, with additional features. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Un-squeezed modules Optimized layout: removed header, search box and footer; removed margins; (optional) reduced font size </p>

<p>Usage: </p>

<p>select in the menu: View -&gt; Sidebar -&gt; IGoogle, or use key combination: Ctrl+Alt+I, or click on toolbar button </p>

<p>To disable the &#39;Reduce font size&#39; feature: </p>

<p>uncheck item in the extension&#39;s Options dialog, or right click in IGoogle Sidebar page and uncheck item </p>

<p>Future versions may include more features like choosing which modules are visible and integration with popular sidebar extensions.</p>

 title : The jquery-asmselect Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionA progressive enhancement to  form elements. It provides a simpler alternative with the following advantages: </p>

<p>Easier for users to understand and interact with than regular  form elements. Users know how to interact with it sans instruction. Doesn&#39;t require user to Ctrl-Click or Shift-Click multiple elements. Instead users of your form can add or remove elements individually, without risk of losing those that have already been selected. Selected elements are always visible (within the confines of your interface) while unselected elements are always hidden (within a regular ). Unlike regular  option elements, those on asmSelect are optionally sortable with drag and drop (this part requires jQuery UI).  asmSelect hides, maintains and updates the original  so that no changes are required to existing code. If a user does not have javascript, then of course the regular  form element is used instead. If the original  form element is modified by some other jQuery or javascript code, the change will be reflected in the asmSelect as well. Try a Live Example Article about the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and others RequirementsjQuery 1.2.6 or newer An HTML/XHTML document that contains one or more  form elements. UsageInclude jquery, asmSelect, and css in document head:</p>

<p>Use a jQuery selector in your document ready function:
<br/>$(document).ready(function() {
<br/>    $(&quot;select[multiple]&quot;).asmSelect();
<br/>}); 
<br/>If desired, you can specify options when you call the plugin: </p>

<p>$(document).ready(function() {
<br/>    $(&quot;select[multiple]&quot;).asmSelect({
<br/>        sortable: true,
<br/>        animate: true,
<br/>        addItemTarget: &#39;top&#39;
<br/>    });
<br/>});
<br/>To optionally set a label inside the select, set the title attribute:</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>OptionsThe following options may be specified using the format in the example directly above this section. </p>

<p>Primary OptionslistType:  Specify what type of list will be created as part of the asmSelect. Allowed values: &#39;ol&#39; or &#39;ul&#39; Default: &#39;ol&#39; sortable:  May the user drag and drop to sort the list of elements they have selected? Allowed values: true or false Default: false Note: In order to use this option, you must have jQuery-UI Draggables, Droppables, and Sortables enabled. highlight:  Show a quick highlight of what item was added or removed? Allowed values: true or false Default: false animate: Animate the adding or removing of items from the list? Allowed values: true or false Default: false hideWhenAdded: Stop showing in select after item has been added? Allowed values: true or false Default: false    Note: Only functional in Firefox 3 at this time. addItemTarget: Where to place new selected items that are added to the list. Allowed values: &#39;top&#39; or &#39;bottom&#39; Default: &#39;bottom&#39; debugMode: Keeps original select multiple visible so that you can monitor live changes made to it when debugging. Default: false Text LabelsremoveLabel: Text used for the remove link of each list item. Default: &#39;remove&#39; highlightAddedLabel: Text that precedes highlight of item added. Default: &#39;Added: &#39; highlightRemovedLabel: Text that precedes highlight of item removed. Default: &#39;Removed: &#39; Modifiable CSS ClassescontainerClass: Class for container that wraps the entire asmSelect. Default: &#39;asmContainer&#39; selectClass: Class for the newly created . Default: &#39;asmSelect&#39; listClass: Class for the newly created list of listType (ol or ul). Default: &#39;asmList&#39;   </p>

<p>listSortableClass: Another class given to the list when sortable is active. Default: &#39;asmListSortable&#39; </p>

<p>listItemClass: Class given to the  list items. Default: &#39;asmListItem&#39; listItemLabelClass: Class for the label text that appears in list items. Default: &#39;asmListItemLabel&#39; removeClass: Class given to the remove link in each list item. Default: &#39;asmListItemRemove&#39;    </p>

<p>highlightClass: Class given to the highlight . Default: &#39;asmHighlight&#39; </p>

<p>Known IssuesIn Firefox (all versions), if your form has an asmSelect that precedes radio buttons or checkboxes, then you should set Firefox&#39;s autocomplete to off. Otherwise, if the user manually reloads the page containing the form, it&#39;s possible for radio/checkbox values to be wrong. This is not an issue with asmSelect, but rather a general issue with Firefox and dynamic form fields. See this issue report for more information The animating of adding/removing items is not as smooth in IE6/IE7 as it is in other browsers. There appears to be an issue with jQuery slide effects on list items with IE, so hopefully this will not be an issue forever. If you don&#39;t like the animation behavior in IE, I suggest setting animate to false. (false is the default) In Safari 3 and Firefox 2, the &#39;add item&#39; animation is not as smooth as in Firefox 3, though the removing is. Improvements need to be made here for more consistent animations across different browsers.  The hideWhenAdded option only works in Firefox 3 at this time. All other browsers continue to show the added items, but they are greyed out (disabled) and not selectable. This may in fact be preferable since the disabled items are placeholders.  In Internet Explorer, there is a slight gap between items that is not present in other browsers. Should be an easy fix with CSS, but haven&#39;t found it yet.  In Internet Explorer 6 (IE6), when dealing with a larger list of items, IE6 will sometimes do some odd scrolling within the select after an item is selected.  Also in IE6, when the list is sortable, the screen will flash every time you add an item. This appears to be getting triggered by the jQuery UI sortable(&quot;refresh&quot;) function that asmSelect calls.  TODOAdd user definable callback functions for add and remove Make it possible for a selection in one asmSelect to alter the available options in another multiple select or regular select form field.  Set a limit for max number of selected items. When the list is sortable, the items will take on a new look with something tactile to make it more obvious that they can be dragged.  Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.  Please NoteDisclaimer - This is a beta version, and as such is not intended for production use yet. If you come across any bugs or issues, or if you see room for improvement in the way it works, or the underlying code, please contact me.  As of July 15th, 2008, asmSelect has been confirmed to work properly with Firefox 2 &amp; 3, Safari 3, IE6, IE7, and Opera 9.5. There are some issues with IE6. See Known Issues above.

 title : The jsonvalidator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Schema By ExampleWell, let&#39;s start with an example.  </p>

<p>A Flickr API method can be invoked to return JSON data. Say, flickr.people.findByUsername may return a JSON-formatted output on successful call: </p>

<p>{&#39;user&#39;:{&#39;id&#39;:&#39;99926721@N00&#39;, &#39;nsid&#39;:&#39;99926721@N00&#39;, &#39;username&#39;:{&#39;_content&#39;:&#39;mderk&#39;}}, 
<br/>&#39;stat&#39;:&#39;ok&#39;} The string above has a lot of obvious information about the structure of possible JSON reply: </p>

<p>The structure is an object, with two attributes -- user and stat; The user attribute is an object, with three attributes -- id, nsid and username; The id and nsid are strings, and username is an object, with one attribute -- content, which is a string; The stat attribute is a string </p>

<p>I assume, any successful output of flickr.people.findByUsername would be of the structure described above. If we know how to parse that string (any JSON parser would do), traverse objects in the parsed result and check the types of values in them, any valid reply can act as a schema.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s simple. If you want a schema to validate data against, simply describe the valid example. So, the schema can be defined as the very string that is specified above, or as an annotated string such as: </p>

<p>{&#39;user&#39;:
<br/>{&#39;id&#39;:&#39;the user id (string)&#39;, &#39;nsid&#39;:&#39;a string&#39;, 
<br/>&#39;username&#39;:{&#39;_content&#39;:&#39;username content&#39;}}, 
<br/>&#39;stat&#39;:&#39;status code (should be ok)&#39;}The more formal description of the schema language: </p>

<p>Strings can be defined a string literals (&#39;anything&#39;). Numeric values can be defined as number literals (3.14). Boolean values can be defined as boolean literals (true or false). Null values are null literals. Objects are object literals ({}). That literal may have attributes defined ({&#39;foo&#39;:1}), in which case the attributes specified are required, and no attributes other than specified are allowed. Arrays are (surprise!) array literals([]). The array literal can optionally define allowed types of the values in array, e.g. [&#39;string&#39;] or [&#39;string&#39;, 1]. If so, no other value types are allowed in array. </p>

<p>For convenience, several types can be described as strings, with &#39;?&#39; appended to indicate that the value can be undefined or null: </p>

<p>&#39;number&#39; or &#39;number?&#39; for numeric values, the latter is to indicate that the value can be skipped; &#39;string?&#39; for string values that can be skipped; &#39;bool&#39; or &#39;bool?&#39; for booleans, required or not. </p>

<p>In my current implementation, there is no rule to indicate objects or arrays as optional, e.g. &#39;object?&#39;. The problem is how we could describe an object structure in this case? The general rule is if we define an object, we should define its attributes as well. I thought about &#39;recursive&#39; JSON descriptions, e.g.  {&#39;foo&#39;:&#39;json:{\&#39;type\&#39;: \&#39;object\&#39;, \&#39;required\&#39;: false, \&#39;definition\&#39;:{\&#39;bar\&#39;:1}}&#39;},  but it makes life ugly, and, apart from that, who may know how deep one may dig into this recursion? The simpler solution would be to validate data against two different schemas both, one of which defined the object in question, and other -- did not. If only one of them failed, then the data is valid. </p>

<p>Well, to examples. The following schemas are equivalent: </p>

<p>{&#39;a&#39;:&#39;there can be a string&#39;}, {&#39;a&#39;: &#39;string&#39;}, {&#39;a&#39;: &#39;&#39;} {&#39;b&#39;:4563}, {&#39;b&#39;: 0}, {&#39;b&#39;: &#39;number&#39;} </p>

<p>The schemas [&#39;string&#39;, &#39;number&#39;], [&#39;anything&#39;, 1] </p>

<p>is valid for [], [3], [&#39;&#39;], [&#39;something&#39;, 4, &#39;foo&#39;] invalid for {}, 1, &#39;&#39;, [true], [1, false] </p>

<p>The schema {&#39;one&#39;: 1, &#39;two&#39;: {&#39;three&#39;:&#39;string?&#39;}} </p>

<p>is valid for {&#39;one&#39;:0, &#39;two&#39;:{}}, {&#39;one&#39;:0, &#39;two&#39;:{&#39;three&#39;:&#39;something&#39;}}, {&#39;one&#39;:2, &#39;two&#39;:{&#39;three&#39;:&#39;&#39;}} and invalid for 1, &#39;&#39;, [], {}, {&#39;one&#39;:0}, {&#39;one&#39;:0, &#39;two&#39;:{&#39;three&#39;:1}}, {&#39;one&#39;:0, &#39;two&#39;:{}, &#39;foo&#39;:&#39;bar&#39;} (extra attribute &#39;foo&#39; in the latter case) </p>

<p>What is not validatedOnly the type of each of the data elements and the objects&#39; structure is validated, not the actual value. E.g., in the Flickr example above, the value of  stat attribute should be &#39;ok&#39;, but it&#39;s not guaranteed to be so by the validator. The validator checks for the fact that the value is a string only, nothing more. The validation would fail for integer or boolean value, but would pass for &#39;maybe&#39; in stat.  </p>

<p>The problem here is similar to the &#39;optional objects&#39; problem above -- the additional language should be defined, e.g. &#39;string;regex:^ok$&#39;, or a JSON equivalent. The simple and elegant decision doesn&#39;t come to my mind yet, so I&#39;ll leave it for tomorrow. </p>

<p>ImplementationsJavaScript: jsonvalidator.js; Require json.js </p>

<p>var schema = &#39;[&#39;string&#39;, &#39;number&#39;]&#39;
<br/>var validator = JSONValidator(schema, true);
<br/>var isValid = validator(data) // data is a JavaScript object  or a JSON string
<br/>// isValid is data or false if invalid.If debug parameter is passed to JSONValidator (the second argument) and is true: validator = JSONValidator(schema, true);And you have Firebug installed, the error is printed to console if validation failed. 
<br/>If throwError parameter (the second) is passed to validator function, and it&#39;s true,     then, if an error occured, it will be raised, so you can wrap the call with try .. catch   and read the error message: try {
<br/>  isValid = validator(data, true);
<br/>} catch (e) {
<br/>  alert (e.message);
<br/>} Python: jsonvalidator.py; Require simplejson </p>

<br/>validator = JSONValidator(schema);

 title : The log5j Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Logger facade that supports printf style message format for both performance and ease of use. </p>

<p>http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/Logger.html </p>

<p>The log5j package supports a &#39;modernized&#39; interface on top of the class Log4j API usage. </p>

<p>It provides a few syntactic extensions thanks to JDK 1.5 (hence the name log5j). </p>

<p>UsageFirst.  It is no long required to give log4j the category when creating a new class level logger.  Log5j just figures it out from the call stack. </p>

<p>For example old usage for log4j was: </p>

<p>private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger( FeedTask.class );and the new syntax with Log5j: </p>

<p>private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger();Much better and fixes a lot of copy/paste errors. </p>

<p>Second.  It provides sprintf support for logging messages </p>

<p>Before: </p>

<p>log.debug( &quot;This thing broke: &quot; + foo + &quot; due to bar: &quot; + bar + &quot; on this thing: &quot; + car );After: </p>

<p>log.debug( &quot;This thing broke: %s due to bar: %s on this thing: %s&quot;, foo, bar, car );That is SOOOOOO much better.  Good god! </p>

<p>PerformanceThere&#39;s also a performance advantage here. </p>

<p>If you were using log.debug() calls with string concat the strings are CONSTANTLY generated even if the debug level is disabled.  This burns CPU and pollutes your heap leading to addition garbage collection. </p>

<p>Now internally the log.debug message isn&#39;t even called and the string is never expanded/formatted unless the debug level is enabled.</p>
 title : The loosejar Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>loosejarDescriptionloosejar is a simple Java Agent that can be used to discover unnecessary jars lying on application classpath. It performs per classloader JVM heap analysis and displays its results. loosejar can be safely used during development, QA, UAT or even in production as it doesn&#39;t modify the state of the JVM at all and adds no overhead.  </p>

<p>The usage is very simple: </p>

<p>Start your application or application server with -javaagent:loosejar.jar flag    (loosejar.jar should obviously point to the correct path of the actual jar) Exercise your application to make sure that the classes get loaded into the JVM. Get loosejar analysis results via JMX console (open jconsole and run com.googlecode.loosejar.LooseJarMBean#summary() in MBeans folder) or on application shutdown (via regular console log). loosejar can only be used on Java 1.5 or higher JVMs. </p>

<p>loosejar 1.0.0 has been released! </p>

 title : The nhocr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Since Sep 8, 2008 / Last update: Feb. 12, 2010 </p>

<p>IntroductionNHocr is a command line OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program for Japanese language, etc. It has been designed to recognize machine-printed Japanese characters and some ASCII characters/symbols in an image. NHocr is probably the first Open Source Japanese OCR software (offline, machine-printed), except some experimental, partial codes open to academic communities. </p>

<p>You can also use NHocr through WeOCR service at: </p>

<p>http://maggie.ocrgrid.org/nhocr/ </p>

<p>The program is highly experimental, and the character recognition performance is limited. (You would become happier with a commercial product if you want a high performance OCR.) </p>

<p>The character feature used in NHocr is based on Peripheral Local Moment (P-LM) proposed by Hori et al. in late 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>NHocr is originally a product of the author&#39;s weekend programming. The development work may be rather slow. </p>

<p>Limitations of the current versionThe current NHocr can handle text block image only, since it has not been equipped with a page layout analysis engine. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate when wide and narrow characters are mixed or when proportional fonts are used. The character segmentation performance is limited, since a very simple segmentation algorithm is used in the current version. The recognition accuracy with ASCII characters may not be so good. Using another OCR, such as tesseract, is recommended for European languages. No language processing (post-processing) is yet included. Supported platforms and requirementsSolaris SPARC/x86 and Linux are officially supported. NHocr would work on other UNIX(-like) platforms and MS-Windows. </p>

<p>NHocr depends on O2-tools package available at: </p>

<p>http://www.imglab.org/p/O2/ </p>

<p>NHocr uses FreeType 2 available at: </p>

<p>http://www.freetype.org/ </p>

<p>Supported languagesThe current version of NHocr supports Japanese only. </p>

<p>The author is interested in supporting other oriental languages such as Chinese. Character code table cctable-xxx is required. Contributions are welcome. </p>

 title : The photo-uploader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PHP5 Reverse ProxyThis is a reverse proxy written in PHP5. It uses cURL to handle the back-end connections. I wrote it to replace some mod_perl code that was slow because it had to talk to our back-end API via XML calls. This turned out to be faster. </p>

<p>What is it useful for?Some uses may include </p>

<p>Extend the class to add an SSO layer to back-end app servers not written in PHP Extend to handle authorization and authentication to a back-end database (SVN, for example) </p>

<p>LimitationsIt does not, currently, handle any caching. I expect that caching could be implemented in a sub-class. </p>

<p>How do I get the code?From the google docs: </p>

<p>Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP. svn checkout http://php5rp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ php5rp </p>

<p>Read the readme.txt. There is an assumption that you know what a reverse proxy is for, and how to configure apache. Other documentation is welcome! :)</p>

 title : The processingas Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Processing.as is a port of the Processing programming language to ActionScript. It includes a fully functional parser and evaluator, as well as an API layer, to run many existing and new Processing scripts. To check out Processing.as in action, take a look at the following examples: </p>

<p>Processing Test Suite (Java/JavaScript/Flash) Processing.as sandbox Using Processing.swfThe processing.swf file can be placed in any webpage and loaded with a Processing script dynamically via JavaScript. First download the compiled package. Embed the processing.swf in your page, and include the &quot;processing.as.js&quot; file. To interact with the swf, add methods to the ProcessingAS variable. For instance: </p>

<p>var Processing = null;</p>

<p>ProcessingAS.onLoad = function () {
<br/>	// movie loaded, get object reference
<br/>	Processing = document.getElementById(&#39;processing&#39;);
<br/>	// start interactivity
<br/>	Processing.start();
<br/>}</p>

<p>ProcessingAS.onStart = function () {
<br/>	// drawing APIs are now available
<br/>	Processing.size(200, 200);
<br/>	Processing.fill(255, 0, 0);
<br/>	Processing.rect(0, 0, 100, 100);</p>

<p>	// run some Processing code
<br/>	Processing.run(&#39;line(0, 0, width, height)&#39;);
<br/>}</p>

<p>ProcessingAS.onResize = function (w, h) {
<br/>	// Processing canvas resized; resize embedded element
<br/>	Processing.width = w;
<br/>	Processing.height = h;
<br/>}
<br/>Using the LibraryThe Processing library can be used for its API or for its Parser. To get started, download the source and unpack it to your script directory. You can take a look at the root-level processing.as for an example, or view the classes in the api/ folder for more information. </p>

<p>To use it in a script, you&#39;ll want to create a new Processing object, call .evaluate() with your code, and then .start(). Additionally, you can call the API methods directly with the .applet.graphics reference (an instance of the PGraphics class). </p>

<p>CreditsMany thanks go to John Resig for his work on Processing.js, and the folks over at Processing for their work in developing the language.</p>
 title : The pycite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pycite is an open source port of Nature Publishing Group&#39;s Connotea to Google&#39;s App Engine platform. </p>

<p>The getting started guide walks you through getting the source and testing it out on your local machine (if you&#39;ve already got Python installed it should take less than ten minutes). </p>

<p>pycite is purely experimental at this stage. You can sign in with your Google ID, add new bookmarks (no edit or delete yet), filter by tag or by user, search by keyword (the full text of pages are already indexed) and get atom feeds for each page. </p>

<p>pycite uses the Connotea&#39;s citation module webservice to extract citation information from the papers that you bookmark. The citation module webservice can be found here here. </p>

<p>The code is pretty simple (&lt; 300 lines). Take a look and feel free to tinker with things. </p>

<p>Features I&#39;d like to see added: </p>

<p>bookmarks added by my friends (from Google&#39;s Social Graph or Contacts APIs) automatic import / export from other bookmarking services (Connotea and Bibsonomy both have APIs) buggotea (&quot;x people have bookmarked this page&quot; functionality) ability to upload PDFs embargoing (Connotea does this) geocoding (Connotea does this too) auto-tagging based on the bookmarked page&#39;s contents (could do this with the Yahoo! Term extraction API) ratings more output formats (atom and HTML are in there now but there could easily be JSON, serialized PHP and XML outputs too to make mashups easy)</p>
 title : The pydot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the homepage of pydot, a Python interface to Graphviz&#39;s Dot language. </p>

<p>pydot allows to easily create both directed and non directed graphs from Python. Currently all attributes implemented in the Dot language are supported (up to Graphviz 2.16). </p>

<p>Output can be inlined in Postscript into interactive scientific environments like TeXmacs, or output in any of the format&#39;s supported by the Graphviz tools dot, neato, twopi. </p>

<p>Requirementspyparsing in order to load DOT files. Graphviz to render the graphs. ChangelogThe release 1.0.2 of pydot boasts the following: </p>

<p>The parser has been improved a lot. It passes all of GraphViz&#39;s regression tests (which I consider quite an accomplishment seeing the kind of crazy constructs on those )  Different charsets should now be dealt with properly.  The search of GraphViz&#39;s executables has been improved for all platforms. On Windows, paths and registry keys are searched. On Unix now it should exhibit the same behavior as the traditional shell path search. (Thanks Andy Gimblett and many others)  Double-quoted paths in Windows are nor properly handled. The os.path.exists() check fails if a valid path is enclosed within quotes.  &#39;type&#39; keyword has been changed everywhere to &#39;graph_type&#39;  Better handling of Node/Edge/Graph defaults. Added methods: set_graph_defaults, set_node_defaults, set_edge_defaults, get_graph_defaults, get_node_defaults, get_edge_defaults  Now it&#39;s possible to use rank to lay out nodes at the same level  graph = pydot.Dot(&#39;graphname&#39;, graph_type=&#39;digraph&#39;)  
<br/>subg = pydot.Subgraph(&#39;&#39;, rank=&#39;same&#39;)  
<br/>subg.add_node(pydot.Node(&#39;a&#39;))  
<br/>graph.add_subgraph(subg)  
<br/>subg.add_node(pydot.Node(&#39;b&#39;))  
<br/>subg.add_node(pydot.Node(&#39;c&#39;))  
<br/>Multiple main graphs in a file are now supported, will be returned as a list of graph instances  Handling of shapefiles Dot().set_shape_files()  Added method &quot;add_style()&quot; to the Node class to easily append styles to a node  Attribute lists updated to reflect the available ones in graphviz 2.16  Added error reporting when rendering graphs with GraphViz executables. There was an often reported problem where the output graphs would have 0 size. In most cases this was due to Graphviz missing a library for a format that pydot assumed to be there. Now the error given by the executable will be reported instead of being silently ignored (Thanks Jarno)  Improved parsing of identifiers  Added non-GraphViz attributes needed by dot2tex  Jose Fonseca contributed a fix dealing with quoted strings the the dot parsing module  setup.py updated so that it&#39;s possible to install pydot through Setuptools&#39; easy_install  Edge()&#39;s can be created passing two Node objects as well as, the previously supported, two strings with node names. Warning: when passing two Node instances, the attributes won&#39;t be taken into account. The edge will only read the Nodes&#39; names to create an edge, the Nodes must be separately added to the graph so all their attributes are &quot;remembered&quot;.  Substituted all str()&#39;s for unicode()&#39;s  It&#39;s possible now to manually specify the path to GraphViz&#39;s executables in the case they can&#39;t be found automatically. The method &#39;set_graphviz_executables(paths)&#39; will take a dictionary specifying the location of the executables. Please refer to the documentation for usage detailed information.  And too many bugfixes to list...  Performance: </p>

<p>The new pydot stores graphs and their objects using a hierarchy of nested dictionaries and lists. Graph, Node, Edge objects are mere proxies to the data and are created on demand. So that now it&#39;s possible to have a graph with a 1 million edges and there will not be a single Edge instance (only if requested, then they will be created on demand, mapping the data and providing with all the methods to act on the data in the global dictionary).  </p>

<p>Storing a graph with 1 million edges in pydot 1.0 has approximately the same memory requirements (~813MiB) as dealing with one with only 40.000 edges in pydot 0.9 (~851MiB), the 40.000 edges graph needs ~35MiB in pydot 1.0 . Handling graphs should be much faster, as no linear searches are performed in pydot 1.0  </p>

 summary : <p>PySmell is a python IDE completion helper. </p>

<p>It tries to statically analyze Python source code, without executing it, and generates information about a project&#39;s structure that IDE tools can use. </p>

<p>There is currently support for Vim, Emacs and TextMate. Feel free to contribute your own favourite editor bindings, or to improve the existing ones. </p>

<p>Download and InstallationPySmell is available at PyPI. The best way to install PySmell is by downloading the source distribution and doing python setup.py install. While easy_install pysmell also works, I haven&#39;t yet found a way of distributing the editor scripts with it (suggestions welcome). </p>

<p>You should be able to import pysmell inside your Python interpreter and invoke pysmell at the command line. </p>

<p>You can track the development of PySmell by visiting GitHub. You can click &#39;Download&#39; to get it as a zip/tar if you don&#39;t have git installed. python setup.py develop will setup your enviroment. </p>

<p>UsageBefore you invoke PySmell, you need to generate a PYSMELLTAGS file: </p>

<p>cd /root/of/project
<br/>pysmell .
<br/>If you want to specifically include or exclude some files or directories (eg. tests), you can use: </p>

<p>pysmell [Package Package File File ...] [-x Excluded Excluded ...]
<br/>Check for more options by invoking pysmell without any arguments </p>

<p>Using external librariesPySmell can handle completions of external libraries, like the Standard Library and Django. </p>

<p>To use external libraries, you have to first analyze the libraries you want, eg. for stdlib: </p>

<p>pysmell /path/to/stdlib -x site-packages test -o ~/PYSMELLTAGS.stdlib
<br/>This will create PYSMELLTAGS.stdlib in your HOME. Copy that in the root of your project, and repeat for other libraries by changing the extension. Note that you still have to have a root PYSMELLTAGS file with no extension at the very root of your project. </p>

<p>Partial tagsSometimes it&#39;s useful to not pollute global namespaces with tags of sub-projects. For example, assume that there is a Tests package, which has hundreds of tests, together with a few testing-related modules. You only want to see these completions when working on test file. </p>

<p>To accomplish that, you can put PYSMELLTAGS. files inside subdirectories, and they will be used only when you&#39;re working on a file somewhere in that directory or its children. </p>

<p>pysmell Tests/FunctionalTest.py Tests/UndoTestCase.py -o Tests/PYSMELLTAGS.Tests
<br/>The information in FunctionalTest and UndoTestCase will only be accessible when editing a file inside the Tests package. </p>

<p>VimTo use PySmell omnicompletion from inside Vim, you have to have: </p>

<p> Python support in vim (:echo has(&#39;python&#39;))  The pysmell package in the PYTHONPATH that Vim uses: python import pysmell should work.  Drop pysmell.vim in ~/.vim/plugins  :setlocal omnifunc=pysmell#Complete Note: If you want to always use pysmell for python, do: autocmd FileType python setlocal omnifunc=pysmell#Complete  OPTIONAL Select a matcher of your liking - look at pysmell.vim for options. Eg: :let g:pysmell_matcher=&#39;camel-case&#39; You can then use XO to invoke Vim&#39;s omnicompletion. </p>

<p>You can generate debugging information by doing: </p>

<p>:let g:pysmell_debug=1
<br/>:e PYSMELL_DEBUG
<br/>Debug information will be appended in that buffer, copy and paste it into the report. </p>

<p>TextMateDouble-click PySmell.tmbundle :) </p>

<p>Complete with alt-esc - look into the bundle for more commands. </p>

<p>You can find the bundle in the source distribution - it&#39;s not installed with the egg, because it&#39;s too much trouble. </p>

<p>Set TM_PYTHON in your Shell Variables to point to the Python where you installed PySmell. </p>

<p>EmacsPut pysmell.el into your load-path, and inside your .emacs file put: </p>

<p>(require &#39;pysmell)
<br/>(add-hook &#39;python-mode-hook (lambda () (pysmell-mode 1)))
<br/>Complete with M-/, create tags with M-x pysmell-make-tags </p>

<p>Pymacs is required as well. </p>

<p>Reporting issuesPySmell is hosted at Google Code. </p>

<p>Look in the issues list first. Star issues that you feel strongly about, or create your own. </p>

<p>If you can create a unit test that exposes that behaviour, it&#39;d be great!</p>

 title : The pythoninthebrowser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Python in the BrowserThis project is now obsolete. It has been replaced by: </p>

<p>Try PythonAn interactive Python interpreter that runs in the browser, using Silverlight 2 and IronPython. </p>

<p>This is ideal for tutorials and documentation, where example Python code can actually be tried in the browser. The demo has some examples &#39;built in&#39; that demonstrate one way it could be used. </p>

<p>It requires Silverlight 2, and the Python version is 2.5. </p>

<p>The interpreter runs in an HTML textarea, with Javascript that communicates with Silverlight and prevents you deleting text from the console except after the interactive prompt. </p>

<p>Target browsers are Firefox 2 &amp; 3, Safari and IE 7 &amp; 8. (It won&#39;t work in other browsers until there is a version of Silverlight that works with them.) </p>

<p>The project is a combination of IronPython (for the interpreter loop), Javascript (for the &#39;console behaviour&#39; in the textarea) and C# (as a helper to call into Silverlight from Javascript).  On every keypress Javascript calls into IronPython (via the C#!). If the keypress is an &#39;enter&#39;, then it pushes the current line into the interpreter loop (which uses the standard library code module). Stdout is diverted to print into the textarea, where tracebacks are also sent. If you are attempting to type over, or delete, previous output then the keypress is cancelled. </p>

 summary : <p>qGuestbookqGuestbook ist unter der GNU GPL Lizenz (Version 3) freigegeben Objektorientert programmiert in PHP5 (OOP) Templates mit validem XHTML und CSS Templatesystem, Mehrsprachig, unterstützt mehrere Datenbanken Eingabe von Homepage und ICQ UIN RSS Feed für die Einträge im Gästebuch Dank qEndoding werden Sprachpakete in mehreren Zeichensätzen unterstützt Beitragsmoderation Benuterrangsystem (User, Mod, Admin usw.) Modulbasiert (Standartmodule: Smilies, BBCode, Badwords, textLimiter) Warum so viel Aufwand für ein Gästebuchscript? Primär geht es mir bei qGB darum, meine PHP Kentnisse zu vertiefen, die ohnehin schon ziemlich gut sind. Außerdem soll qGuestbook allen die Möglichkeit bieten, ihr Gästebuch ganz einfach auf die eigenen Bedürfnisse anzupassen. </p>

<p>Mitarbeiten? Desinger, Coder und Übersetzer werden immer gesucht! ;) </p>

<p>Übersetzungen? Bis dato sind nur Deutsch und Englisch in Planung. Da ich selbst leider nicht mehr Sprachen beherrsche, ist hier die Community gefragt. Es empfiehlt sich aber zu warten, bis qGuestbook RC1 erscheint. Im Moment gibt es noch zu viele Änderungen und viele Teile des Codes sind noch nicht für Mehrsprachigkeit ausgelegt. </p>

<p>Gibt es eine Demo? Es gibt eine Demo, jedoch ist sie etwas veraltet und nicht mehr auf dem aktuellen Stand. Insbesondere wird noch das alte Design benutzt. Ein recht aktueller Screenshot findet sich hier. </p>

<p>qGuestbook ist frozenqGuestbook wird nicht mehr weiterentwickelt, zumindest nicht mehr von meiner Seite her. Mir fehlt einfach die Zeit dazu. Ein schwerere Schritt, ein schon soweit fortgeschrittenes Projekt einfach so liegen zu lassen. </p>

<p>Es geht aber nunmal momentan leider nicht anders. </p>

<p>Weitere Infos gibt es auf </p>

<p>Alte News und Updates24.08.2008 - Endlich eine Installationsroutine! </p>

<p>Endlich ist es geschafft, somit beginnt die letzte Etappe zum Aufstieg zum ersten Release Candidate. qGuestbook lässt sich nun recht einfach installieren. Es ist zwar weiterhin nur eine Installation mit MySQL möglich, dennoch ist dies eine enorme Erleichterung für unsere Betatester. Das automatische schreiben der Konfigurationsdatei funktioniert übrigens auch tadellos. </p>

<p>Jetzt fehlen nur noch einige kleine Features und einige Bugfixes, dann ist qGuestbook eigentlich bereit für den täglichen Einsatz. Insbeondere bei der Modularen Erweiterbarkeit gibt es noch einige kleine Feinschliffe zu erledigen, dennoch ist das größte hiermit geschafft. Der RC1 Release wird definitiv noch dieses Jahr erscheinen, wann genau kann ich aufgrund dessen, dass ich nun wegen der Arbeit weniger Zeit habe, mich um qGuestbook zu kümmern nicht genau sagen. </p>

<p>Mir wäre aber sehr damit geholfen wenn ihr euch jetzt schon die SVN Version herunterladen würdet und diese auf Fehler überprüfen könntet. Fehlerreports entweder ins Forum oder per E-Mail oder Instant-Messenger an mich, Kontaktdaten findet ihr auf der Hauptseite von www.simlau.net. </p>

<p>17.07.2008 - Weitere Anpassungen für die Erweiterbarkeit mit Modulen </p>

<p>In den Modulen können neue Dateien angelegt werden. Diese werden automatisch von qGB verarbeitet. Im Moment wird noch an diversen Möglichkeiten zur Veränderungen des Templates zur Laufzeit gefeilt. </p>

<p>class.php - Die Modulklassendatei hat nun einen festen Namen. Nicht mehr $modulname.php wir vorher.
<br/>admin.php - Administration des Moduls (wenn vorhanden wird die Datei automatisch im ACP gelistet)
<br/>install.php - In der Klasse ist der ganze Quatsch für die Installation.
<br/>uninstall.php - Ebenfalls eine eigene Datei für die Deinstallation.15.06.2008 - SVN Entwicklung wieder aufgenommen! qGB bekommt eine Modul API </p>

<p>Die SVN Entwicklung wurde wieder aufgenommen. Heute wurde qModule integriert. Hier ein Beispiel Code: </p>

<p>  $module-&gt;action(&#39;index_before_vars&#39;);	
<br/>  $row[&#39;post_id&#39;] = $encode-&gt;encode_html($row[&#39;posts_id&#39;], false);
<br/>  $row[&#39;posts_name&#39;] = $encode-&gt;encode_html($row[&#39;posts_name&#39;]);
<br/>  $row[&#39;posts_text&#39;] = $encode-&gt;encode_html($row[&#39;posts_text&#39;], false);
<br/>  $module-&gt;action(&#39;index_after_vars&#39;);Die Methode action(); ruft hier einmal vor der Bearbeitung der Variablen die Methode $Modul::index_before_vars() und einmal nach der Bearbeitung die Methode $Modul::index_after_vars(). Die Methode index_after_vars() ist z. B. im Modul BBCode definiert und wandelt BBCode-Tags in HTML um. Für alle wichtigen Aufrufe sind &quot;Actions&quot; definierbar, bei denen eine Modul Methode aufgerufen wird. So kann qGuestbook sehr leicht angepasst werden. </p>

<p>Dies bringt auch den Vorteil, dass nun BBCode und Smiliepakete komplett als externe Module ausgelagert werden können. Outsourcing quasi, und das sogar wörtlich.</p>

 summary : <p>SUP (Simple Update Protocol) is a simple and compact &quot;ping feed&quot; that web services can produce in order to alert the consumers of their feeds when a feed has been updated. This reduces update latency and improves efficiency by eliminating the need for frequent polling. </p>

<p>SUP is being developed by FriendFeed. </p>

<p>Benefits include: </p>

<p>Simple to implement. Most sites can add support with only few lines of code if their database already stores timestamps. Works over HTTP, so it&#39;s very easy to publish and consume. Cacheable. A SUP feed can be generated by a cron job and served from a static text file or from memcached. Compact: updates can be about 21 bytes each. (8 bytes with gzip encoding) Does not expose usernames or secret feed urls (such as Google Reader Shared Items feeds) Resources: </p>

 title : The tilgungsplan Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The amortization scheduler Tilgungsplan allows to find the maturity or the installment of a loan. It is able to calculate changing interest and/or installment over maturity. In case of a changing interest, it can calculate a new installment to ensure the maturity doesn&#39;t change. The completely calculated amortization schedule can be displayed in a table and you can copy the contents of the table to the clipboard. From there you can insert the amortization schedule into a spread sheet, for example. </p>

<p>Tilgungsplan is able to calculate a so called effective interest, that represents the percentage the loan really costs in the first year. With this effective interest you can compare the loan over different banks, because how to calculate the effective interest is defined by law, at least in Austria. </p>

<p>Tilgungsplan was developed under Linux and needs KDE3. This gives the program a modern dialog, makes it easy to deal with the program. Beside this it was developed to be portable to every operating system that offers KDE3. This includes even Windows, if Cygwin was installed.</p>

(The Media Access Key needs to be entered to download data.  The group and sort settings must match the TiVo&#39;s settings to correctly play the show.) </p>

<p>TiVo DetectionTiVoRemote version 0.15 has the ability to automatically detect TiVos on your network (this is accomplished by listening for the UDP broadcast packet that TiVos send out about every 60 seconds).

 summary : <p>Twittereeze is a SIMBL (Smart InputManager Bundle Loader) extension for Twitterrific (freeware), a Mac OS X client for the Twitter service. Twittereeze aims to improve Twitterrific&#39;s user experience in small ways. </p>

<p>While Twitterrific itself is a nice little app to send and receive &#39;tweets&#39;, i.e. change your own status and stay up-to-date on that of others, I primarily use Twitter in a similar manner to an IM network&#39;s status message. Thanks to AppleScript, the status messages of iChat (AIM/.mac/ICQ, Jabber/Google Talk/LiveJournal), Skype and Adium (many, many protocols) can be changed through a simple API. With Twittereeze enabled, any status that Twitterrific sends to Twitter as a &#39;tweet&#39; automatically becomes your status on those three applications as well, provided you have them running. </p>

<p>Moreover, Twittereeze makes the &#39;What are you doing?&#39; text field frontmost (except when it doesn&#39;t make sense), so you can typically type right away, and it adds the following keyboard shortcuts: </p>

<p>cmd-F11 for globally toggling the Twitterrific window (and, where applicable, making it frontmost) cmd-shift-F11 for globally making the Twitterrific window frontmost ctrl-up and ctrl-down for navigating the list of recent tweets while the &#39;What are you doing?&#39; text field is frontmost. In a nutshell, it eliminates many, many cases of having to unnecessarily switch between keyboard and mouse to use the interface. </p>

<p>I&#39;m releasing this in the hope that it will be as useful to others as it has been to me. </p>

<p>Twittereeze requires a Twitter account and Twitterrific as well as an installed SIMBL. It currently comes with no preferences of its own; the aforementioned shortcuts are thus far hardcoded.</p>

<p>更新这原本是我的一个学习Django的实验项目，已经有好几个月没有维护了，没想到大家给了很多建议，我将在2010年每周尽量抽出些时间对项目进行更新和维护，同时，有想要一起开发的朋友，也可以给我发邮件，pandaxiaoxi@gmail.com </p>

<p>特性目前拥有特性如下： </p>

<p>用户系统，注册，登陆 发主题贴，发回复贴 可以进行用户设置，增加个性化信息 发贴使用了WYMeditor编辑器 </p>

<p>设置方法这是一个可重用的app，可以直接放到你的project中作为一个app使用。 设置方法如下： </p>

<p>拷贝forum目录到你的project下 把forum/site_media下的styles目录拷贝到你的media目录中 把forum/templetes下的forum目录拷贝你的templetes目录中 把forum app加到你的project的settings.py文件中 在你的project的urls.py文件的urlpatterns中增加一行代码 (r&#39;^forum/&#39;,include(&#39;yourproject.forum.urls&#39;)), 
<br/>这样，forum应该就可以在你的project中跑起来了。 注意: media文件的url是&#39;/site_media/&#39;开头的 如果你是在Django自带服务器中测试的话，urls.py的urlpatterns中还必须加上下面这行代码，处理静态文件。 (r&#39;^site_media/(?P.*)$&#39;,&#39;django.views.static.serve&#39;,{&#39;document_root&#39;: MEDIA_ROOT}),</p>

 title : The wordmill Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WordMill is a simple web forum which doesn&#39;t require registration to post/respond. </p>

<p>It is in its very early stages. Basic functionality has only just been completed and the interface is bare and undocumented. </p>

<p>Its most innovative feature is the simplification of the standard 5-step web forum process (Foum homepage, Signup form, Sign in, Select sub-forum / category, Post) to its own 2-step process (Forum homepage, Post). </p>

<p>I think you will find that registration discourages many people who want to post one thing from doing so, thus depriving your community of precious remarks by outsiders. </p>

<p>Seeing as no registration is required WordMill attracts everyone&#39;s remarks. Everyone but spammers that is! WordMill uses Akismet to stop you from getting flooded with spam. (No Captcha which would also discourage novice internet users unfamiliar with that process.) </p>

<p>Ignited Coders wanted! Want to join in? We are looking for CodeIgniter developers to help this baby along its RoadMap. If you&#39;re interested please send the project owner an e-mail. (add @gmail.com to his user name).</p>

 title : The ccrevisionlabeller Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CC Revision Labeller is a plugin for CruiseControl.NET that allows you to generate CruiseControl labels for your builds, based upon the build and revision number of your Subversion working copy. This can be customised with a prefix and/or major/minor version numbers.  </p>

<p>Labels follow the Microsoft versioning standard i.e Major.Minor.Build.Revision </p>

<p>Build Numbers are automatically incremented. Revision Number is pulled from the subversion working copy. </p>

<p>RequirementsCruiseControl.NET v1.3 - the plugin has been compiled and tested against this version of CC.NET. As such, it uses the .NET Framework 2.0, and is not backwards compatible with previous versions of CC.NET. If you cannot upgrade to this version of CC.NET and want to use this plugin, you can rebuild from the source code, but your will need to replace the solution and project files to work with Visual Studio 2003. </p>

<p>InstallationTwo builds are provided - Debug and Release. You should only need the Debug build if you are diganosing technical issues with the plugin. Just drop the contents of either src\ccnet.SvnRevisionLabeller.plugin\bin\Debug or src\ccnet.SvnRevisionLabeller.plugin\bin\Release into the folder that CruiseControl.NET is running from, update ccnet.config with the appropriate configuration (see below), and restart the service. </p>

<p>ConfigurationBelow is a sample configuration for svnRevisionLabeller, showing the mandatory fields: </p>

<p>	3
<br/>	1
<br/>	svn://localhost/repository/trunk
<br/>The following sample configuration shows the complete set of fields: </p>

<p>	Test
<br/>	3
<br/>	1
<br/>	svn://localhost/repository/branches/dev-project
<br/>	ccnetuser
<br/>	ccnetpassword
<br/>	true
<br/>	40
<br/>Usage
<br/>	7
<br/>	11
<br/>	svn://localhost/repository/trunk
<br/>When CruiseControl.NET begins a project build, it generates a label for the build and stores it in the property CCNetLabel - this property can then be used by NAnt or MSBuild to generate the AssemblyInfo.cs for your assemblies, so that CC.NET displays as its label the same version that the assemblies are built with. So, if the configuration for the labeller is set as: and the latest Subversion revision number is 920, the CCNetLabel will be set to 3.1.1.720.  </p>

<p>Forcing a build without any changes to the repository will not increment the build number and it will stay as 3.1.1.720. </p>

<p>A subsequent commit to the repository would then set the label to 3.1.2.921, and so on. If a prefix is applied, that will need to be stripped from the label before creating AssemblyInfo.cs. </p>

<p>	MyProject
<br/>	3
<br/>	2
<br/>	svn://localhost/repository/branches/dev-project
<br/>	ccnetuser
<br/>	ccnetpassword
<br/>	true
<br/>	1
<br/>resetBuild allows one to reset their build numbers. This is useful when working on a new iteration or a new release. </p>

<p>Consider the case where the current label is 3.1.43.1230 This basically means that for 3.1 release we have created 43 builds. This build can be referenced in Subversion as revision number 1230. If one decides to now move to 3.2 - instead of incrementing the build number to 44 it makes sense to reset the build. To do this one will have to pass resetBuild as true and a build number. </p>

<p>In this case we will set it as one. On the next commit to the respository the label would be 3.2.1.1231 telling everyone that this is the first build for the 3.2 release. </p>

 summary : <p>Una librería de gráficos en java. </p>

<p>La base de la librería es un Lienzo gráfico con dos capas. Una de fondo en la que dibujar gráficos y otra superior, transparente, para dibujar cursores, objetos arrastrables, de forma que no sea necesario realizar un repintado de todo el gráfico al mover uno de estos objetos. </p>

<p>Los gráficos a dibujar son clases que hereden de objeto gráfico. Reciben una clase de pintado similar al java.awt.Graphics de java, pero en el que las coordenadas a usar son directamente coordenadas de usuario en vez de pixels. </p>

<p>Los objetos gráficos se añaden a voluntad al lienzo. Se pueden usar los ya creados o bien hacerse unos nuevos. Existen además objetos gráficos suscritos a los movimientos del ratón, de forma que se pueden arrastrar o reaccionar a los clicks de ratón. </p>

 summary : <p>ClassBus is an event delivery API written using Java (TM) 1.5. It decouples event producers from consumers. </p>

<p>The EventService interface is the central &quot;bus&quot;. You can publish any kind of object to an EventService instance like this: </p>

<p>myEventService.publish(&quot;someChannelName&quot;, aMessageObject);Subscribers receive events from the EventService. A subscriber must implement a simple interface: </p>

<p>public interface EventSubscriber {
<br/>  void onEvent(T event);
<br/>}Subscribers attach to the bus through a combination of the channel name and event type. Subscribers can listen to particular channels by exact name match, regular expression, or any other matching strategy you can dream up. You can similarly match on event type, subtype, or some other pluggable matching strategy. </p>

<p>Finally, events are delivered via a DeliveryStrategy interface. Out of the box, we provide an Event Dispatch Thread strategy that ensures subscribers are notified on the EDT.</p>

<p>Passwords obviously are important and most people know by this time how to pick a good one.  </p>

<p>For many people, the problem is not so much that their password is weak and too easy to guess or steal (though this is still a common problem.) The problem is that they use their same strong password over and over again -- meaning if it is compromised at any one of the sites where they use it, it can be misused at another one.  </p>

<p>Mushpup can help you pick a strong, unique password that can be securely retrieved from anywhere there&#39;s an internet connection. </p>

<p>The original trunk has been branched to http://mushpup.googlecode.com/svn/branches/version1/.

<p>The goal of this project is to develop a web based application that generates geographic maps of DNA haplotype data that are often used in the course of phylogeographic analysis. The application will create maps of pie charts viewable through Google Earth that show the spatial distributions of each haplotype, the frequency of each haplotype in each population, and the number of samples included per population. This program may also be useful to people outside of evolutionary biology; anyone who has need of visualizing frequency data on maps may find this application helpful.</p>

<p>I always begin from &#39;revision4&#39; :-0 </p>

<p>The project is merely an attempt to create a resource for like minded users and developers so to speak. “Please make sure your seat backs are in their full, upright position, and that your tray tables are stored. Flight attendants, prepare for take-off….” </p>

 summary : <p>Sailcut8 was originally written by Robert Lainé and is now supported by the junk rig community through the members of the Yahoo! Junkrig Group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junkrig/ </p>

<p>Robert is now concentrating on developing Sailcut which is a cross-platform sail design package for either 4 sided sails like for an old timer gaff rig or 3 sided sails like jibs or main sails for a Marconi rig.  His new Sailcut does not design junk rig sails.  See: http://www.sailcut.com </p>

<p>Sailcut8 lets you design the geometry of a junk rig sail that will be made from separate horizontal panels where the sail can have a user-specified amount and position of built-in camber. Sailcut8 produces lofting specifications for the separate panels. </p>

<p>Sailcut8 automates the ideas of Arne Kverneland as described in: http://home.triad.rr.com/boatbarn/arnek.htm  </p>

<p>You can download a Windows installable version of Sailcut8 from the &#39;Downloads&#39; section of this web-site.  You will need to unzip the file sailcut8-packageV1.0.zip into a temporary folder and execute the setup.exe file in that folder. </p>

<p>See also: http://code.google.com/p/sailcut8/wiki/Versions for more information about downloading Sailcut8. </p>

<p>Note: there is no documentation available at this time - you will have to experiment with the controls to see how it works. </p>

<p>Sailcut8 is written in Visual Basic 6 and only runs on MS Windows computers.  You will need a VB6 development environment (Visual Studio) if you want to modify the source.</p>

 summary : <p>This projects objective is to allow 4D users to use a source management tool like subversion. </p>

<p>v1 : just methods exported and imported in text files. interface with subversion can be made with third party tools or command line. </p>

<p>Future releases :\\ </p>

<p>- integrate the subversion API into 4D (no need to use a third party tool)\\ 
<br/>- handle other objects (forms, tables, etc...)\\ 
<br/>- handle international tokens (french, etc...)\\ </p>

<p>The Quick Start page is here : QuickStart </p>

<p>The project should be plug-in independant (easy to switch from “API Pack“ to &#39;Dynamic Structure“ for instance). </p>

<p>WARNING : this tool is a work in progress. ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR STRUCTURE BEFORE IMPORTING OR UPDATING CODE. Something could go wrong and you could loose your code. As Rob Laveaux said in its API Pack documentation, if someting go wrong nobody can help you, Member of this project, Pluggers (Rob Laveaux, author of API Pack), Commited Software (author of Sanity Check) or 4D won&#39;t be able to help you...</p>

 title : The swt-paperclips Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to PaperClips: a simple, light weight, extensible Java printing plug-in for SWT.  PaperClips hides the complexity of laying out and rendering documents on the printer, helping you focus on what to print instead of how to print it. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, PaperClips provides an assortment of document &quot;building blocks,&quot; which you can tweak and combine to form a custom document. The assembled document is then sent to PaperClips for printing.  PaperClips includes support for printing text, images, borders, headers and footers, column layouts and grid layouts, to name a few.  It can also be extended with your own printable classes. </p>

<p>With PaperClips you do not have to track cursors, calculate line breaking, fool around with font metrics, or manage system resources--it&#39;s all handled internally.  And unlike report-generation tools, you are not constrained to a predefined document structure (like report bands).  Every document is custom and the layout is up to you. </p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<p>Java 1.4 or later. SWT 3.2 or later. SWT may be downloaded at http://www.eclipse.org/swt/. PaperClips can be used as an Eclipse plug-in or as a regular Jar (provided the SWT libraries are on the classpath).</p>

<p>Comme on va utiliser Netbeans pour le projet, voici un petit tuto qui résume l&#39;installation et la configuration du client Subversion pour Netbeans: CollabNet.Le lien http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion/ </p>

<p> Installation du client </p>

<p>Avant tout, fermez Netbeans Dans un premier temps, récupérez l&#39;archive présente dans la section download du site. Une fois le fichier téléchargé, renommez le fichier en retirant l&#39;extension .badack Décompressez l&#39;archive Zip Installez l&#39;exécutable (ex: D:\Program Files\CollabNet Subversion\) Dès que l&#39;installation est terminée, ouvrez une invite DOS et tappez la commande suivante: svn --version (Vous devriez obtenir du texte explicatif en retour si tout c&#39;est bien passé).  Configuration du client dans NetBeans  </p>

<p>Lancez Netbeans (mais pas trop loin :) ) Allez dans Versionning =&gt; Subversion =&gt; CheckOut Il est possible qu&#39;à ce stade Netbeans vous demande de lui indiquer le répertoire où est installer le client svn (ex: D:\Program Files\CollabNet Subversion\), donnez lui à manger le path complet et redémarrer Netbeans Retournez dans Versionning =&gt; Subversion =&gt; CheckOut Remplissez les champs suivants: Repository Url: https://terjee5.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Username: votre adresse Email Gmail (sans l&#39;extension @gmail.com) Password: votre mot de passe généré par le site Google code (Pour avoir ce password, faites settings) Voilà une bonne chose de faite !!!! </p>

<p> Sinon on peut utiliser SVN tortoise sous Windows, ce qui a le désanvatage d&#39;être obligé d&#39;aller faire click droit sur le repertoire du projet et l&#39;uploader, dans ce cas le versionning reste à désirer.</p>

 title : The admb-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Now available for MacOSThe ADMB software suite is an environment for non-linear statistical modeling enabling rapid model development, numerical stability, fast and efficient computation, and high accuracy parameter estimates. ADModel Builder is a high level language built around the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension which transparently implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. A closely related software package, ADMB-RE, implements random effects in non-linear models. </p>

<p>Management of human and natural systems often requires understanding of non-linear relationships among dependent variables and suites of independent variables. Off-the-shelf software packages usually demand many compromises to adapt appropriate models to non-appropriate software. Reliable, efficient non-linear models that can be rapidly applied to real data will make natural systems more amenable to prediction. </p>

<p>The Mission of the ADMB-Project is to promote wider application of ADMB to practical problems and to assist current ADMB users to become more proficient. </p>

<p>ADModel Builder, ADMB-RE and AUTODIF were created by David Fournier of Otter Research Ltd.</p>
 title : The baubau Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&#39;baubau&#39; is a multithreaded backup tool written in python. </p>

<p>It aims to create a backup of all unrecoverable files which either don&#39;t belong to any package or have been modified. </p>

<p>The logic behind it is fairly simple: </p>

<p>the main loop walks the file-system searching for files a second thread checks whether the file belongs to a package (using information from rpmdb) if the file belongs to a package, a third thread compares it against the rpm database (size and eventually md5 checksum) all modified files and new files are listed to a file (and packed into a tar archive on the fly if requested) To avoid including unnecessary files and thus saving space, baubau uses regexp expressions to force the exclusion or inclusion of certain files (for instance media, log and lock files are excluded in /etc/baubau/exclude_files). </p>

<p>Generally speaking, the resulting archive will typically contain all files which cannot be restored by simply reinstalling packages. For instance: </p>

<p>your home directory all the configuration files you have modified your log files baubau will create a directory in your home directory (-d to specify the directory): </p>

<p>[root@navid-laptop ~]# ls -l /root/baubau-20070313-131511
<br/>total 1892
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       0 Mar 13 13:15 excluded_files
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     278 Mar 13 13:15 excluded_files_regexp
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       0 Mar 13 13:15 excluded_pkg_files
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1900544 Mar 13 13:15 included_files
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       0 Mar 13 13:15 included_files_regexp
<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   25425 Mar 13 13:15 rpm-qaThis directory will also be included in the tar-ball archive if you decide to let baubau create one for you (-z option). </p>

<p>Ideally, in order to fully restore from backup all you have to do is reinstall the rpm packages and then extract the archive produced by &#39;baubau&#39; over the root file-system.</p>

 title : The crimsonglory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Crimson Glory is a side-view air combat dogfighting game set in the post WWI mediterranean . The game is inspired by Miyazaki&#39;s movie Porco Rosso. The game and engine are developed by Michal Marcinkowski creator of Soldat. He is using the engine in his new game, the structure of the engine and all of its core components like scripting and entities will be the same. </p>

<p>The basics you need to know are: The whole source is written in C++ ready to compile and go from Visual Studio 7 (it should run on any other compiler) There are 2 projects Crimson (the executable) and GameDLL (the DLL that is executed by the exe); basically the interesting stuff, meaning the whole game is in GameDLL </p>

<p>The engine uses several subsystems: </p>

<p>- graphics: Irrlicht (also used for geometry, including math and vectors) - sound: FreeSL (wrapper for OpenAL) - player animations: Cal3D - scripting: GameMonkey - network: RakNet - maps format: DeleD </p>

<p>The game runs on Windows, however it is possible to compile it on any system. The problems I see are in the different components like FreeSL or Cal3D.</p>

 summary : <p>Project DescriptionThis scriptpack aims at enabling the osd-display that one has with the standard xandros os on the eee-pc on other distributions. </p>

<p>Furthermore it offers support for the fn-fx hotkeys for brightness, volume control and so on. </p>

<p>Currently this scriptpack has only been adopted and customised for eeeXubuntu but developers who use other distributions on their eee may feel free to port it for their distribution as well. </p>

<p>CHANGELOG2.1added configfile functionality position of the osd can be altered osd-imagetheme can be changed improved wifi-on-off script added command to fn+f6 hotkey various minor bugfixes 2.0scriptpack now uses a customized version of the asusosd application, so it does not have to be built around the asusosd application anymore but can make real use of it a lot of the external scripts could be removed since their functionality was moved into the custom asusosd executable the issue with slow or leaping display of volume level should be improved a lot with this release the installer script was modified so it can be used to upgrade an older version without any precautions necessary (this behaviour will be kept for any future version) 1.1removed unnecessary debug-output in volume_control.sh  create a lot more sophisticated install script which will make sure directories exist and files and directories get the needed permissions added logging to the install script so that progress and errors are logged to logfiles for easier debugging 1.0the initial version of the scriptpack</p>

 title : The opprua Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OPPRUA/DSS is a fully powered, fully integrated, and full coverage  support for the enterprise web applications and their development process.  It offers </p>

<p>the most promising comprehensive JavaScript toolkit today for your best user interface built directly to its native environment: the browser. Sponsored and supported by most of todays industrial heavy weights, you can be sure your application UI is built on a solid foundation that... (OK, we didn&#39;t do this. It is Dojo. But we do give you complete access to the entirety of the power of Dojo.) the most popular web application platform on the server side. Your application will be deployable to most of the standard enterprise IT infrastructures. With a powerful programming language... (OK, your application will be standard Servlet with Java 5 or later). the leading full-stack Java/JEE application framework of today. A powerful light weight POJO container that brings Inversion of Control, Aspect Oriented Programming, a smooth integration with a host of Object-Relationship mapping tools and much much more... (OK, again we didn&#39;t do this. It is Spring framework. But we do give you a full fledged Spring container for the management of you POJOS that form your server together). a seamless integration framework connecting the two sides while providing extensive support to the development process. This IS what we do. Opprua is a protocol  that connects the very dynamic front-end of an AJAX web application to  the powerful support of a complex business back-end. DSS stands for  Dojo - Servlet - Spring, which are the base technologies on both sides of the applications. Our framework connects these two sides. </p>

<p>Our own contribution to the mix is smallest in size. It amplifies the power of the other elements. Essentially, a DSS application  consists of two set of components. The UI components, called views,  are browser bound based on Dojo. They are completely user facing with  all their data delivered automatically for them. The server components, called workers, are POJOs managed by Spring. They are completely  back-end facing, only called upon when their services are required.  The rest is managed by DSS framework. With access to the complete application internal structure, the framework also provides a host of support for the development process. Please read  DSS for programmers for more details. </p>

<p>latest activities </p>

<p>09/24/2007: we have a tiny application implemented on OPPRUA/DSS. This  serves as a PoC for us and as a preview for interested users. Unfortunately DSS is still too far away from being useful. We will use it to build a non-trivial application as a way to &quot;harden&quot; it. If you are brave enough, you can download the preview version (oppruaSimple.zip). A small readme file will walk you through some playing with it. Otherwise please checking again around the end of this year. We might have a better version (beta version?) ready by then. Thank you.</p>

 title : The ulair Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Developing an application installer for all distributions of GNU/Linux which resolves package dependency problem by identifying the distribution and installing the requisite binaries from a local/remote server. It would also locate the missing libraries or packages to be installed and then actually install the packages by informing the user. Something like “apt-get” of Debian or ”yum” of Redhat Linux. But it would include a single point browser independent as well as browser based installer script like &#39;Klik&#39; possibly developed in Python and even a GUI front-end for newbies which would connect a local server maintaining a classified and tagged package repositories (*.rpm or *.deb or *.bin) and a Click and Run (CNR) (Automatix for Ubuntu), (SMART for SUSE) package support system alongside an updated list of client-side installations. This list may be optionally updated by refreshing from the client side. All installations would be with respect to binaries. The intended distributions of GNU/Linux system to be supported are : Redhat, SUSE, Mandriva, Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and many other clones of the above mentioned.</p>

<p>The purpose of this software is to eliminate the individual package search and online download cum install of each package on every machine on a local area network. Though individual PC users may also use this as a package manger to download and install their favorite application softwares on Linux, this installer is best suited for users on a LAN or network who want to download and install all the popular software applications on their respective machines without actually being online or behind a proxy server. It is also suited for heterogeneous distributions of Linux on a network all wanting common softwares. Though we cannot guarantee for every linux distribution present on this planet. We are fairly sure to be compatible with all the leading linux distributions especially enterprise class distributions.</p>

 title : The cooliris-automator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cooliris (http://www.cooliris.com/) made a great little javascript tool which displays web galleries as a photowall.  Although Cooliris released a utility to create galleries, it is only for Windows and MacOS and very tedious if you want to upload a lot of galleries.  Also, many digital photos can be well over 3 megabytes each and I have found that at such high resolutions they are difficult to manage.   </p>

<p>Introducing Cooliris-Automator, a shell script which works to rectify both these problems.  It uses imagemagick to resize the images and create thumbnails and then creates the .rss and .html files necessary to be viewed with Cooliris. </p>

<p>The current version (0.5) only has the image resize and thumbnail function.  It does not interface with Cooliris yet.  At this time, only Jpeg images are supported. </p>

<p>ETVComskip also integrates with PyeTV, a Leopard Front Row plugin for interacting with EyeTV.  With this plugin it&#39;s possible to turn commercial skipping on and off directly from within Front Row, as well as start a commercial search on recordings which don&#39;t have commercial markers already. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload the appropriate version for your system 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard).  Double click to open the .dmg file and run the installer application. </p>

<p>Some few users have reported problems with the .dmg files.  In this case, make sure the extension on the file is .dmg and nothing else.  That should resolve the issue. </p>

<p>NotesIt is possible to have a user configuration file which indicates programs/channels not to process for commercials; this might be useful for public broadcasting channels where it is known that there are no commercials.  See the README-EyeTV3 file for details. </p>

<p>The current versions are designed to work with EyeTV3.  The last version which works with EyeTV2 is 1.0RC6. </p>

 summary : <p>This is a free Shell-Script designed for Mac OS X </p>

<p>It&#39;s Purpose is to eliminate the hassle of modifying a Macintosh&#39;s settings manually, in order to make it appear more &quot;Unix-like&quot; </p>

<p>Written in the Bourne Again SHell (BASH) script</p>
 summary : <p>To perform an operation, such as &#39;delete all files except .jpg and .jpeg in a directory, and copy all those jpg/jpeg files into another directory&#39;, you&#39;ll have to either write a native program or a shell script. There are some disadvantages though: native program is lack of flexibility (you have to compile it again to enable new features), and shell script cannot run both on Windows and Linux. So this script language (PHP) based project enables you to do this sort of things in PHP. An architecture is ready, all you have to do is pick up functions to apply on files in a directory, or, if the function you want doesn&#39;t exist, you can write one under the architecture. It won&#39;t do any good to non-programmers, but it does help a lot for programmers hopefully.</p>

 title : The flex-shell-script-daemonizer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Flex Compiler Shell (FCSH) is a very useful tool for speeding up flex based compilation. However it requires commands to be pasted into the shell, making it awkward to use inside your own build workflows.  </p>

<p>PurposeSeveral projects exist for launching FCSH as a separate process, and sending it compilation commands.  </p>

<p>For the project I am working on (omixed), we want to be able to provide our Flex code projects to colleagues so that they can build them with as little fuss as possible. Our code projects currently use ant tasks to manage the building, so it would be nice if we could tap into fcsh using ant. Since ant and fcsh both run on Java the solution needs to be Java based. </p>

<p>Our collaborators work on various platforms (Windows, OSX and Linux), so we need a solution that will work for all of them. Also we cannot dictate what IDE they should use.  </p>

<p>Since we have already decided that the code must be built using ant tasks, and since fcsh is a Java tool as well, it makes sense that any existing FCSH process manager we use also runs on Java.  </p>

<p>ImplementationThis project borrows a lot from existing FCSH daemon projects in terms of design and coding, but tries to do so in an platform/IDE agnostic way.  </p>

<p>Currently the tool can be accessed via an ant task, but it can also be accessed via the command line making it possible to be embedded in a variety of build workflows. </p>

<p>Many thanks to these projects : </p>

 summary : <p>smbcp is a wrapper script that calls smbclient to copy a file to/from a Windows cifs share to/from a unix system using scp like parameters. </p>

<p>After dealing with end users of a unix system that needed to regularly move files to and from different Windows systems and determining that a smbmount type solution is to overbearing and admin heavy, I wrote smbcp.  If a user knows how to use scp, it&#39;s similar so there&#39;s not much of a learning curve.  It also transfers files without the need to mount the Windows host before hand or perform ftp like commands with smbclient.  Many unix flavors come with smbclient so smbcp should be relatively easy to be ported to different unix versions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only tested on Sun Solaris systems but hope to get it portable.  The code is also very rough - proof of concept rough even though I have users using it currently.  The script smbrm is a hack of smbcp that provides a way for a unix user to delete a file from a windows host. A smbcp command followed by a smbrm command provides a way to emulate the mv command. </p>

<p>smbcp does not currently support multiple file transfers which should be integrated.  smbclient doesn&#39;t have a easy way to handle multiple files without doing a tar type of operation so there&#39;s some work that needs to be done. </p>

<p>Usage: </p>

<p>smbcp {source} {destination} 
<br/>source|destination = {username}%password@{hostname}:{filename} | {filename}  
<br/>The var SMBPASSWD can also be used. </p>

<p>&quot;Mission Statement&quot; of SortsTo put it simply, unit testing should be transparent. There shouldn&#39;t be the complexity of test harnesses and coding out stub files. This functionality should be there if you want it, but the barrier to writing tests should be so low that it becomes easier to write the test than the code itself. It is on this philosophy that SnapTest was built. </p>

<p>Build a PHP unit testing framework Create a 0-effort harness. Easy to run the code, easy to get results Maintain transparency in the code and the community Be as non-intrusive as possible Be memory efficient Link to complex infrastructures easily Take advantage of the OO structure PHP 5 provides Emphasize end-users as one of the most important resources Promote unit testing in a non-oo PHP world </p>

<p>To use it, you must install the xdebug-extension on your web-server, and configure it to allow remote debugging connections. The port used is 9000 (Default for xdebug). If you have a firewall, you will need to open up this port.  </p>

<p>See documentation for details on how to get up and running.</p>

 title : The tomboy2tiddly Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This script converts Tomboy notes to TiddlyWiki tiddlers. It may be useful for those who want to switch to TiddlyWiki but have some Tomboy notes around. </p>

<p>IntroductionThe script preserves Tomboy cross-references (and converts them into wiki-links), but it ignores font styling and highlights. The converted notes have the creation date as their last modification in Tomboy, and the modification date is the time when you run the script. To easily locate converted notes they are tagged as from_tomboy. </p>

<p>I heard there is a Tomboy plugin to convert notes to TiddlyWiki, but I did not try it as I no longer have Tomboy installed. In fact, if you still have Tomboy installed you may try it. </p>

<p>RequirementsThis is a shell script, but it requires: </p>

<p>xmlstarlet, a command line tool to work with XML files (i.e. parse Tomboy notes) Python, it is used to convert dates (anyone is welcome to replace it with Perl or whatever, but I think Python is quite common nowadays) </p>

<p>Downloadtomboy2tiddly </p>

<p>How to use1. Backup your TiddlyWiki file. Make sure it is not open in the browser (otherwise it may be overwritten later). </p>

<p>2. Convert the notes and save the results until later: </p>

<p>$ tomboy2tiddly ~/.tomboy/*.note &gt; tomboy_notes(I suppose tomboy2tiddly is in your $PATH). </p>

<p>3. Open the file with your TiddlyWiki in the text editor, and insert the contents of previously saved tomboy_notes inside . Putting it just after the `</p>

<p> works for me. </p>

<p>You may achieve it everything with just one command and vim: </p>

<p>A safer RM tool which uses a trash </p>

<p>MotivationOnce upon a time, I deleted my homework and there was no way of redemption. I spent some time breathing fire on the &quot;rm&quot; tool, and tried my level best to recover these files. Finally, I gave up and rewrote everything from scratch.  </p>

<p>I tried a simple alias to make rm prompt by default. It soon drove me up the wall.  I then tried a simple alias for rm to mv. That did not work most of the time and it drove my friends up the wall (Who did not know of the alias). This was when I started development of this wrapper script and grew up to version 2.x. </p>

<p>After which I started using the KDE desktop predominantly and discovered that the files I deleted with trsh and the ones I delete with the desktop file manager were never in sync (I used another trash folder and different specifications). This was the birth of trsh 3.x - a rewrite, which is in evaluation period and should be stable by 4.0. (I am liberal with my version numbers). </p>

<p>This is one if the first scripts I install on a clean system and hence I am also the biggest user. As I use this almost every day, I discover most the the bugs and annoyances and try to fix them.  </p>

<p>Use the current 3.x with caution and please do report bugs: 1. Any departure from the workings of day-to-day /bin/rm usage is a bug. 2. Any departure from the freeDesktop.org&#39;s trash specification is a bug. </p>

 summary : <p>SPEECH ENABLING DIALOG: BUILDING A SIMPLE SPEECH &#39;GUI&#39; </p>

<p>Vialog is a speech version of the widely used ncurses widget library, dialog. In this project, dialog-1.1-20070409 has been voice enabled to work with popular speech synthesis engines such as Flite and eSpeak. </p>

<p>The goal of the project is to instrument intelligent speech rendering into each of the native curses-based widgets of dialog. All the components of dialog have been speech enabled except for tailbox. Michael Gorse&#39;s Emacspeak eflite server provided the original model for building a threaded speech control subsystem. </p>

<p>The quality of the interface still needs to be tuned to improve usability. Also work needs to be done to reduce certain artifacts of speech generation such as popping between audio segments and anomolies in waveform shaping when increasing voice speed. </p>

<p>However, the work so far provides enough interface power to satisfy the requirements of certain real-life installation, configuration, and information scripts. Examples include the dialog-based configuration and help scripts of the lnx-bbc Linux rescue distribution. </p>

<p>Once vialog is launched with one of the supported widgets, the following speech-enabled audio control commands are available: </p>

<p>Control-A V will toggle volume control mode on or off. Control-A S will toggle speed control mode on or off. Control-A P will toggle pitch control mode on or off. Control-A R will refresh the voice screen. Control-A H will announce a help message. Plus (&#39;+&#39;) will increment volume, speed, or pitch depending on mode. Minus (&#39;-&#39;) will decrement volume, speed, or pitch depending on mode.  If a .vialogrc configuration file has been found in the user&#39;s home directory, then any new values given to the speech settings will be saved.</p>

 title : The clf-to-sql Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>There are very few utilities that provide detailed analysis of one&#39;s server logs. The main reason for this, IMO, is the high barrier-to-entry of reading Apache logs. </p>

<p>This program solves that problem by allowing you to import your server logs into a SQL database. I&#39;m hoping that people will take it from there, and write programs to analyze web traffic from the database, which is much easier than reading a log. You can even do basic analysis yourself, if you&#39;re proficient with SQL, using your SQL implementation&#39;s live query prompt. </p>

<p>select * from table_name where timestamp = 2007-03-20; select * from table_name where pathname like &#39;/blog%&#39;;</p>

 title : The sql-dsl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>as a java programmer, to develop a system, mostly we need to create sql by different criterions.  </p>

<p>If we introduce hibernate, it provides criterion module to us, and if we introduce ibatis, it provides sql fragments to consist the last sql.  </p>

<p>But, how if we don&#39;t introduce them? How can we enjoy the convenience by querying by criteria? </p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s why I create this project to provide a very thin layer for java programmer to ease the pain of assembling sql string. </p>

<p>SAMPLE        Table t = table(&quot;table&quot;).as(&quot;t&quot;);
<br/>        Table t1 = table(&quot;table1&quot;).as(&quot;t1&quot;);
<br/>        Field tId = t.field(&quot;id&quot;);
<br/>        Field t1Id = t1.field(&quot;id&quot;);
<br/>        Field t1Time = t1.field(&quot;time&quot;);</p>

<p>        Sql sql = select(tId).from(t).join(inner(t1, tId.eq(t1Id)))
<br/>                .where(and(tId.eq(&quot;&#39;a&#39;&quot;), t1Time.between(&quot;&#39;1900&#39;&quot;, &quot;&#39;2000&#39;&quot;)))
<br/>                .groupBy(tId).having(tId.gt(&quot;1&quot;))
<br/>                .orderBy(asc(tId));
<br/>        assertThat(sql.toString(), equalTo(&quot;SELECT t.id &quot;
<br/>                + &quot;FROM table AS t &quot;
<br/>                + &quot;INNER JOIN table1 AS t1 ON (t.id=t1.id) &quot;
<br/>                + &quot;WHERE ((t.id=&#39;a&#39;) AND (t1.time BETWEEN &#39;1900&#39; AND &#39;2000&#39;)) &quot;

 title : The flepjhaverkamp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A project that implements a realistic 3D simulator frontend and a complete TCP/IP-like protocol stack for a network consisting of EYES Wireless Sensor nodes. </p>

<p>Timespan: 6 weeks. Completed on June 29th, 2008. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>AuthorsThis project has been created by: </p>

<p>H.Y. Bruintjes J.H. Donker C.E. Etheredge J. Teeuw As part of the 214515 Codesign project (2008) at the University of Twente. </p>

<p>ConceptThe scope of this project includes creating a completely functioning protocol stack that is capable of transmitting reliable packets to half-duplex radio frequency transmitter nodes that are connected in a network. This includes everything from creating the C/C++ serial drivers (to control the nodes) up to the routing algorithms and tables that decide the shortest path to certain nodes through the network, so the top application layer (and the application running on top) is capable of sending and receiving reliable messages to and from other nodes. </p>

<p>In addition, a fully functional 2D simulator is required that is capable of letting the user create node networks in specific graphs and testing the reliability and performance of the protocol stack underneath. This is a crucial step in determining in which situations the protocol stack works best. </p>

<p>Our implementation consists of a reliable TCP/IP-like stack with appropriate routing tables that is capable of meeting the above requirements, and extending these by providing a graphical frontend complete with a small 3D engine that is capable of simulating not only the node network, but also a physically correct representation of the world (by using the Bullet physics engine). We believe that in adding this we extend the potential realism of the simulator, as situations with different scenes (e.g. imported models of buildings and rooms) and networks could be imported and tested properly. </p>

<p>We also provide a way of not only simulating nodes in the simulator frontend, but also allowing the user to let real radio transmitter nodes (connected to the serial port) be part of the simulator&#39;s world, so both hardware (real) and software (simulated) based nodes can communicate and form a network. </p>

<p>The radio transmitter nodes used are EYES Wireless Sensor nodes, as provided by the project&#39;s requirements. </p>

 title : The jtv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JTV is a small Java application that enables you to watch tv over a network and record tv programmes. Its main goals are simplicity and ease of installation, modification and use. </p>

<p>JTV is not ready for the &quot;general public&quot; (yet), but if you know a little Java and Linux you can start to play around with it today. Browse the wiki and GettingStarted for more information. If you got MythTV to work (even if just a little), then JTV should be a breeze (even if its functionalities are minimal). </p>

<p>Although the target server setup for JTV currently is Linux with IVTV drivers installed, technically it is not limited to this. Java 6.0 is required however. </p>

<p>If you just want to watch some television over your home network and record some programmes as quickly as possible without any setup hassle, then JTV might just be for you.</p>

 title : The mint-os Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MintBSD-licensed C++ Operating SystemA fresh look at what an Operating System should be. </p>

<p>PhilosophyMint&#39;s philosophy can be summed up with a few lines. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about function and form in harmony... It&#39;s about the beautity of good implimentation... It&#39;s not what works, but what works best in the broadest context... GoalMint&#39;s goal is to be a very simple and clean C++ operating system.  Ideal for students or those who just want to learn. </p>

<p>All portability, compatibility, etc. are sacrafised toward this end.  This is done so that Mint is not bound by the concepts of prior systems, and when bound it is bound as little as possible.  However, the plan is to provide wrappers and support code later to make up for this in areas such as POSIX compliance. </p>

<p>Coding Guidelines</p>
 summary : <p>This is my Hobby OS project. You may use it for educational purpose. This OS kernel is written using gcc-4.1.2 under linux. I used fedora-8, But i think it will be compilable under other linux too. The total OS is developed under QEMU for linux. Tested under BOCHS. and very little tested under Real hardware. </p>

<p>The source code has some inline GCC assembly and some NASM assembler files. for compilation a shell script is used.   To test this you will need a GRUB floppy and in grub.conf put the kernel path. </p>

 title : The rockscuda Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I have run out of space in the repository and am waiting for google to expand my project site.  Source is available as tar files on my website at  </p>

<p>http://sites.google.com/site/scottlhamiltonresearcher/rocks-rolls </p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. </p>

<p>Alpha Level Code is now Available.  This is completely untested I am waiting for hardware to do the tests. </p>

<p>This project will contain the source code and iso images for an NPACI ROCKS 5.0 Roll for Nvidia Cuda libraries and drivers. </p>

<p>The best way to build this roll is to follow the instructions on NPACI ROCKS website for download the ROCKS 5.0 source code repeated below.  </p>

<p>$ hg clone http://fyp.rocksclusters.org/hg/rocks-5.0This will create a ROCKS 5.0 source code repository on your local machine in the rocks-5.0 folder.  You will need to add this source into their tree. </p>

<p>$ cd rocks-50/src/roll
<br/>$ svn checkout http://rockscuda.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rockscuda-read-only
<br/>$ mv rockscuda-read-only rockscuda
<br/>$ cd rockscudaYou will now need to decide if you want the CUDA 2.0 beta or the CUDA 1.1 build. </p>

<p>For CUDA 1.1 do this: </p>

<p>$ cd cuda
<br/>$ mv * ../
<br/>$ cd ../
<br/>$ makeFor CUDA 2.0 Beta do this: </p>

<p>$ cd cuda2
<br/>$ mv * ../
<br/>$ cd ../
<br/>$ makeThis will result in an iso file of the roll.  Which can be installed by doing the following: </p>

<p>$ cd rocks-50/src/roll/
<br/>$ rocks add roll rockscuda-5.0.0.arch.disk1.iso
<br/>$ cd /home/install
<br/>$ rocks enable roll rockscuda
<br/>$ rocks-dist distThen you can install your cuda enabled nodes by using insert-ethers and selecting cuda. </p>

<p>If your head node should be CUDA enabled then do the following. </p>

<p>$ kroll rockscuda |bash</p>

 title : The wireless-cell-phone-terminal Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My company, http://www.dialie.com/ provide today credit card processing, taximeter and digital dispatching for the taxi cab industry. i do only the software in web basis in JAVA. </p>

<p>my customers, and all the taxi industry pay a lot for the hardware. for exemple a wireless terminal for credit card processing cost between 800$ and 2000$. if they buy a professionnal Mobile data terminal with the gps for the credit card and the digital dispatching they buy it 1000$ each + all the server at 40,000$ usually. </p>

<p>My idea was to develop a software on a cell phone on a taximeter(that everybody as so there is no extra fees) and plug it on the taximeter (that all taxicab drivers has too). so we could for 0$ extra cost provide a credit card solution or a digital dispatcing solution with sprint for exemple with our free open source software. because i am alone to do it, i look for some help here.</p>

 summary : <p>Welcome!Starflub is an attempt by two high school students to write an operating system. Our goal is to have a full fledged operating system with a usable GUI and support for 3rd party applications. </p>

<p>Note: It&#39;s now two years later and this project has kind of died due to other things. It was a great learning experience, and the code is still up for anyone who would like to look at it. </p>

<p>Also, forgive me for all the subversion horribleness. I was new to it back then and I&#39;m a lot better at it now. </p>

<p>What we&#39;ve done so farStarflub is currently a (mostly) textual kernel with some experimental GUI components. We&#39;re trying to make it as modular and independent of Linux/UNIX code or code from other kernels. Using some tutorials from osdever.net and other sites, as well as using some open-source projects for help, we&#39;ve hacked together a kernel with some features </p>

<p>We&#39;ve got: </p>

<p>Keyboard support (Experimental) mouse support (Experimental) VGA drivers Paging (but it hardly works) Multitasking (it works in theory) Virtual File system Error handling Other things (that hardly work) </p>

 title : The tqlinux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I wish Linux was a very strong competitor to MS Windows or even Mac OS X, but it is not yet. Even if many users say that the stability of Windows sucks, they still use it. Of course, it is also a matter of available applications for many different purposes, but to be honest, it is not the only one problem of Linux. Simply Linux is still too harder to configure. </p>

<p>In my opinion one of the sources of this difficulty is the architecture of the Linux kernel - the monolithic one. I dont want to bother with a technical stuff, but in short, the microkernels and hybrid kernels (like Windows or XNU of the Mac OS) are more flexible and easier to manage. Of course, there are projects like „Linux on L4” (Linux virtualized on the L4 microkernel), but they are prosthesis only. </p>

<p>However, Linux has became one of the most popular competitors to Windows and is considered as more stable than MS operating systems. And more and more applications are developed for this competitor. Also the Linux kernel is actively developed and maybe some day its architecture and the Linux distros will be much easier and better to set up.  </p>

<p>TQLinux is a project to make Linux distribution what will be fit, fast, stable, easy to set-up and to develop applications for it. </p>

 title : The arpon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ArpON (Arp handler inspectiON) is a portable handler daemon with some nice tools to handle all ARP aspects.  </p>

<p>It has a lot of features and it makes Arp a bit safer. This is possible using two kinds of anti Arp Poisoning tecniques, the first is based on SARPI or &quot;Static Arp Inspection&quot;, the second on DARPI or &quot;Dynamic Arp Inspection&quot; approach. </p>

<p>Keep in mind other common tools fighting ARP poisoning usually limit their activity only to point out the problem instead of blocking it, ArpON does it using SARPI and DARPI policies. </p>

<p>Finally you can use ArpON to pentest some switched/hubbed LAN with/without DHCP protocol, in fact you can disable the daemon in order to use the tools to poison the ARP Cache. </p>

<p>However ArpON is also a good tool to a clever sysadmin aware of security related topics. It is a tool born to make Arp secure in order to avoid Arp Spoofing/Poisoning &amp; co. </p>

<p>Remember it doesn&#39;t affect the communication efficiency of the ARP protocol! </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>- It manages every aspect of the ARP protocol </p>

<p>- It replaces utilities such as arp, arping, arpscan </p>

<p>- It replaces arpwatch, arpon blocks </p>

<p>- It detects and blocks ARP Poisoning/Spoofing attacks in statically configured networks </p>

<p>- It detects and blocks ARP Poisoning/Spoofing attacks in dinamically configured (DHCP) networks </p>

<p>- It detects and blocks unidirectional and bidirectional attacks </p>

<p>- Easily configurable via command line switches, provided that you have root permissions </p>

<p>- It works in userspace for OS portability reasons </p>

<p>- Tested against Ettercap, Cain &amp; Abel, dsniff </p>

 title : The embeddedgmetric Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ganglia&#39;s gmetric is a handy command line tool to inject custom metrics into gmond.  However it and libganglia are not designed for embedding into a C/C++ application.  Nor does it provide any scripting interface. </p>

<p>This project provide scripting modules that do not require gmond.conf or gmetric or any other dependencies (these are not wrappers around C code or call gmetric).  There is also a C/C++ library for embedding into applications. </p>

<p>Language  Wiki  Protocols  Dependencies   C/C++     GmetricClib  UDP only   none -- self contained   Python    GmetricPython  UDP, multicast  none -- pure python, one file   Php       GmetricPhp  UDP only        none -- pure php, one file   perl      GmetricPerl  TBD  one file   Java      GmetricJava  UDP, multicast   none -- one file, multicast project  </p>

<p>BenefitsThe main benefit of embedded gmetric into your script or application is to avoid the overhead of </p>

<p>parsing gmond.conf (assuming it is available on your machine) starting a new process calling gethostbyname to resolve the socket </p>

<p>For the occasion metric, calling out to gmetric is not a problem.  However if you wanted to inject dozens (hundreds?) of statistics the overhead can slow you down. </p>

<p>When not to use embeddedgmetricYou should continue to use regular gmetric if you have any type of special configuration that involve sending stats to multiple machines, sockets, multicast addresses. </p>

<p>Embedded gmetric primary is useful when you send stats to one machine, especially when using UDP. </p>

 title : The evs4j Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CREDITS
<br/>-------
<br/>Paul Kendall (testing, code review, bug fixes)
<br/>Samant Maharaj (testing, code review, bug fixes)</p>

<p>EVS4J is a pure-Java(tm) implementation of the Totem single ring protocol:</p>

<p>&quot;The Totem Single-Ring Ordering and Membership Protocol&quot;,
<br/>Y. Amir, L. E. Moser, P. M. Melliar-Smith, D. A. Agarwal, and P. Ciarfella, 
<br/>ACM Transactions on Computer Systems 13, 4 (November 1995), 311-342.</p>

<p>NOTE: The flow control algorithm in this article uses a fixed window size.
<br/>      I found that this would make it impossible to use the same
<br/>      network for anything else, so I implemented congestion control.
<br/>      Now the window backs off nicely when needed. A maximum window size is
<br/>      still required.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>- Group membership (configuration) service
<br/>- Reliable multicast
<br/>- Total ordering
<br/>- Flow control
<br/>- Congestion control
<br/>- Recovery of messages when a processor fails or joins</p>

<p>WARNING: Using multicasting on your LAN can take away precious bandwidth from
<br/>others on the network and create huge delays. Do not try this code on your LAN
<br/>unless you know that the packets won&#39;t end up on some production network (and
<br/>sometimes this happens by mistake.) Talk to your sys admin.</p>

<p>Usage
<br/>-----</p>

<p>To use this protocol you need to do the following:</p>

<p>1. Pick integer ids for the nodes in your cluster, e.g. 1,2,3.
<br/>2. Pick a port number to send multicast packets on.
<br/>3. Pick a multicast address.
<br/>4. If you have more than one adapter on each node pick one subnet you want to use.
<br/>5. Get an instance of a Connection object.
<br/>6. (Probably) create a Listener object.
<br/>7. Call open() on the connection.</p>

<p>Some time after open() returns, the method Listener.onConfiguration() is called.
<br/>This is to notify the application that a configuration (a ring, or group) has been created.
<br/>After this you can expect to receive messages through the onMessage() method.</p>

<p>See the API documentation and src/Example.java for an example.</p>

<p>Configuration parameters
<br/>------------------------</p>

<p>The class which implements evs4j.Connection is:</p>

<p>evs4j.impl.SRPConnection</p>

<p>The constructor has the signature:</p>

<p>SRPConnection(long, Processor, String)</p>

<p>The first parameter can be zero 0 when running a test, but in a real application it should
<br/>be the id of the last configuration used before the system was shut down. This id should be
<br/>forced to disk in Listener.onConfiguration() and it should be read from disk when creating
<br/>a new connection.</p>

<p>The second parameter is a Processor object with an arbitrary integer id which must be
<br/>unique across the cluster. This id could be generated from the ip address of each,
<br/>but that will depend on each cluster.</p>

<p>The third parameter is a string containing name value pairs using &#39;=&#39; between name and
<br/>value and &#39;&amp;&#39; between pairs, for example:</p>

<p>&quot;port=9100&amp;ip=224.0.0.1&amp;nic=192.168.254.0/255.255.255.0&quot;</p>

<p>This is the complete list of properties:</p>

<p>port			The port number used on multicast packets. Required.</p>

<p>ip			The _multicast_ ip address used, e.g. 224.0.0.1. Required.</p>

<p>nic			The network interface to be used. This can be either of the form
<br/>			###.###.###.###/###.###.###.###, e.g. 192.168.254.0/255.255.255.0
<br/>			or the &#39;name&#39; of the interface, e.g eth0. This property is required
<br/>			only when the machine has more than one network adapter installed.
<br/>			This is the proper behavior because the EVS4J benchmark creates a
<br/>		        multicast storm and we don&#39;t want to do that to the wrong network.</p>

<p>windowSize		The _maximum_ window size (number of messages) to be used for
<br/>			flow control. The window size at any given moment varies between
<br/>			0 and this value. The window size will decrease automatically
<br/>			(following the Van Jacobson et al. protocol) if you start ftp
<br/>			file transfers etc. on the same network. In a production
<br/>			environment you might consider using a dedicated network.
<br/>			You can use this parameter and the size of the ring to tune
<br/>			latency and throughput.
<br/>			Optional. The default is 30.</p>

<p>tokenDroppedTimeout	A timeout in milliseconds used to determine if the token
<br/>			was dropped by the network or by the receiver&#39;s buffer and
<br/>			needs to be re-sent. See totem article for details.
<br/>			Optional. The default is 3.</p>

<p>tokenLossTimeout	A timeout in milliseconds used to determine if the token
<br/>			was dropped because one of the processor _failed_. When
<br/>			this timeout expires the remaining processors attempt to
<br/>			form a new configuration. See totem article for details.
<br/>			Optional. The default is 1000.</p>

<p>joinTimeout		Analogous to tokenDroppedTimeout but applies to the membership
<br/>			protocol. See totem article for details.
<br/>			Optional. The default is 3.</p>

<p>consensusTimeout	Analogous to tokenLossTimeout but applies to the membership
<br/>			protocol. See totem article for details.
<br/>			Optional. The default is 1000.</p>

<p>Known issues
<br/>------------</p>

<p>Under certain conditions on Linux the network card (or cards) have to be
<br/>configured specifically to support certain multicast addresses. If you are
<br/>not receiving any packets this may be the reason.</p>

<p>Support
<br/>-------</p>

<p>There is no commercial support for this code, however you can try me at
<br/>lichtner_at_bway_dot_net if you like.</p>

<p>Benchmark
<br/>---------</p>

<p>The following command runs 2 processors both sending and receiving 1450-byte packets in one JVM:</p>

<p>java -classpath evs4j.jar \
<br/>     -Xincgc -client \
<br/>     evs4j.tool.benchmark.Main \
<br/>     -props &quot;port=9100&amp;ip=224.0.0.1&amp;nic=192.168.254.0/255.255.255.0&quot; \
<br/>     -procs 1 2</p>

<p>In a recent test on 4 dual-core desktop machines evs4j achieved 25,000 messages per 
<br/>second (270 Mpbs,) with a token rotation time of 2ms. We had to change the maximum 
<br/>message size in the code from 1450 to 1423, as it turns out that this fits exactly into a
<br/>udp packet (thanks for Paul Kendall for discovering that the maximum message size was too large.) </p>

<p>When the switch supports jumbo frames you can change the maximum packet size and the
<br/>maximum message size to 9000 and 8923, respectively (presently these have to be changed
<br/>in the code,) and achieve about 6000 messages per second (400 Mpbs.)</p>

<p>EVS4J 1.0b3
<br/>-----------</p>

<p>Incorrectly handled case of 2 network adapters. Should have forced user to
<br/>specify one, but didn&#39;t. Fixed.</p>

<p>Paul Kendall and Samant Maharaj sent in a patch for two bugs, one being a bug in
<br/>the code that collected free nodes in the message buffer and put them back in the
<br/>free list (a 6-line change) and the other a bug in updating the last safe message id.
<br/>Legal note: on 3/2/2006 Paul assigned the copyright to me (Guglielmo Lichtner) on
<br/>behalf of himself and Samant Maharaj.</p>

<p>EVS4J 1.0b2
<br/>-----------</p>

<p>On Linux 2.6.x with ipv6 support the nic-finding code threw an exception. Fixed.</p>

<p>On Windows XP when you bring an adapter down it seem to disappear entirely.
<br/>Added code to report to handle this case more informatively.</p>

<p>In SRPRecovery.java there was a FIXME about delivering messages from the
<br/>transitional processors _only_. Fixed.</p>

<p>EVS4J 1.0b1
<br/>-----------</p>

<p>First release since around January 2004 (0.9.1).</p>

<p>Deprecated EVS4J project in SourceForge because it uses CVS which is
<br/>hard to administer. I am using my own Subversion repository now. I have
<br/>removed a lot of code and done some refactorings to simplify the system
<br/>as much as possible.</p>

<p>Changed the license. This code is now licensed under the Apache License,
<br/>version 2.0.</p>

 title : The libverbose Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>libverbose is a library (not yet thread safe) which overrides certain functions and logs pertinent information to syslog. It is used via LD_PRELOAD (or I suppose via LD_LIBRARY_PATH). An optional configuration file is loaded each time the library is loaded. </p>

<p>PurposeWhile it may have other uses, libvervose was created for use in a web hosting environment. Specifically to combat PHP exploits. That is, you have a client who&#39;s sites are continually or currently being exploited. This library should help you track down the problems. </p>

<p>It has been tested with suPHP but can likely be used with mod_php also. </p>

<p>ltrace and straceThis is not intended to compete with those tools. Most of the time these tools are appropriate.  </p>

<p>OverviewThe current implementation interposes the following functions: </p>

<p>connect send write close popen execv execve execvp execl execle execlp ApacheWrite is used by Apache to serve pages. However, as we only log writes preceded by connect() call&#39;s we should not be logging pages written to Apache clients. mod_proxy calls will be logged. </p>

 summary : <p>A Python program and set of modules for managing Maildir and mbox email archives.  On top of Python 2.5&#39;s mailbox module, this project provides: </p>

<p>Frameworks for email classification logic and mailbox maintenance actions A built-in collection of well-tested rules and actions that will suffice for many use cases Additional exception handling and runtime consistency tests Simple and extensible YAML configuration Logging of mailbox maintenance actions The target audience for this application is, essentially, me:  I wrote this because I wanted an easy way to manage the mbox and Maildir mailboxes on my laptop in conjunction with Procmail and Mutt, so that the old spam can be automatically deleted and the old mailing list messages automatically archived.  But this software could just as well find home on an IMAP server, and so I&#39;m hosting it on Google Code in case someone else might find their own use for it in any circumstance.</p>

 title : The ocal Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a tool to simplify the management of an Oracle Calendar implementation by working as a higher-level wrapper to the existing command line utilities. </p>

<p>BackgroundThe web-based administration interface for Oracle Calendar (OCal) is limited, so much work must be done with command line utilities. Ordinarily this would make a sysadmin happy, but these utilities require one to enter a password with each invocation. In earlier versions of OCal this password could be included as a parameter, but this is a security risk and not recommended (due to this risk this option was removed in OCal 10g). </p>

<p>The result is that a sysadmin has to enter the OCal sysop password a number of times while performing day-to-day operations. At best this is a constant annoyance, but perhaps more importantly it acts as a barrier to writing scripts to simplify tasks, provide information or simplified access to calendar data, add local features on top of OCal, etc. There are C- and Java-based APIs for OCal, as well as a web services API, but they are limited to working on the data from a single account and cannot help with the administration of an entire OCal implementation. </p>

<p>The utilities provided here eliminate the need to enter a password with each invocation and thus the barrier to scripting and simplifying the OCal commands. There are also a number of higher-level tools that work above these commands. </p>

<p>Though OCal seems to be a dying (dead?) product, it is hoped that this project will be useful to those who continue to maintain OCal implementations. </p>

<p>ApproachThe utilities are written in Python and use the Pexpect library to interact with the OCal command line utilities. The sysop password can be kept in a .netrc file in the same way that Unix FTP clients manage passwords, or can be entered once at the beginning of a session and re-used for multiple invocations of OCal commands. </p>

 title : The rollout Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Rollout is a system developed to automate system administration on UNIX servers. It is primarily focused towards Linux, but could be adapted to Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, etc. </p>

<p>It is written purely in Perl, and the configuration is also a Perl source file. Some Perl knowledge is required to edit the configuration, but copy-and-paste may suffice. </p>

<p>System Administration can generally be reduced to a set of steps, which must be completed in order. Some example steps include: </p>

<p>Copy files, create symlinks Edit configuration files Start / stop services Add / modify users &amp; groups Install applications The idea behind Rollout is to automate all these steps in a configurable way. Rollout is by design idempotent - it can be run many times on a single server and produce the same results.</p>
 title : The rolloutx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This tool is a clean rewrite of another tool I built at an old employer over a number of years. </p>

<p>I took advantage of not having a legacy code/user base by making some changes to the interfaces internally. </p>

 title : The thomashartman-shellenv Open Source Project on Open Hub

 title : The timefix Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis library allows a developer or a sysadmin to force Java applications (including those hosted on Java servers such as Tomcat) to use the host operating system&#39;s timezone info (stored at /etc/localtime, using the tz database format). </p>

<p>It was created because Sun&#39;s JVM has its own timezone info (which gets quickly outdated in countries where Daylight Saving Time changes every year, such as Brazil). Sysadmins (and some Linux distros) are used to update this information on the underlying OS, but doing the same on the JVM can be complicated and/or unfeasible. </p>

<p>UsageTo use the library, application developers can just call the Timefix.fizTimeZone() method on the application startup (but it makes your app OS-dependable). A better solution for OS-neutrality (and for deployers/sysadmins that have no access to the application source code) is to force the timezone change by &#39;injecting&#39; the class on the application&#39;s startup script. </p>

<p>For example, if your startup script contains: </p>

<p>java com.xyz.MyAppStartupClass param1 param2 param3 
<br/>you can just add the lib to the classpath (e.g.: export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:timefix-1.0.jar) and insert &#39;timefix&#39; before the main class name: </p>

<p>java timefix com.xyz.MyAppStartupClass param1 param2 param3 
<br/>and the app will start with the correct timezone info. Whenever you change /etc/localtime, just restart the applicaiton and it will use the new info. It also works with application servers (such as Tomcat, in which you change catalina.sh). </p>

<p>Included LibraryThe &#39;magic&#39; of reading and interpreting timezone information from /etc/localtime is cast by Stuart D. Gathman&#39;s excellent Java implementation of the tz routines, which you can download at http://www.bmsi.com/java/#TZ. It is included in this project in compliance with LGPL, and a copy of his ZoneInfo.java is included (unchanged) on the repository just as a convenience for builders - you should check his page for other uses (and to see lots of interesting code too).</p>
 summary : <p>Mission Statement: To make client side scripts and css easy for academics to embed in their Blackboard pages in a way that is easy to maintain and support. </p>

<p>This is an open source project. The design has been taken and developed internally at QUT. I&#39;m hoping it will get a release. </p>

<p>Features </p>

<p>(Planned) Easy to use client interface (Planned) Easy to maintain system admin interface Pool of starting scripts and css </p>

<p>Requirements </p>

<p>Tested on Blackboard 7.2, 9 </p>

<p>At the system admin level, there is a title, embed code and instructions for each script. File upload can be dealt with outside of the building block or inside if it will make maintenance easier and is not difficult to develop. For the client, an item can then be added on the page to include these scripts and an area for custom code while maintaining a central location of the repository for maintenance. In display mode, the plugin would render the embed code for the included scripts and any custom code.</p>

 title : The usepackage Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Usepackage is a tool for managing the Unix environment for a multi-tool, multi-platform site. It is designed to simplify login scripts and allow administrators to control users&#39; environments centrally. This tool should be considered primarily designed for sites where users have to deal with a number of different tools, or versions of tools, that are installed in different locations and require environment variables to be set. This is particularly a problem for developers, or anyone who has to manage a large toolset across multiple platforms (e.g. different versions of the Sun JDK which require various environment variables to be set correctly). One or more central configuration files control a number of different &#39;packages&#39; and their associated environment and dependencies for different platforms (this includes the standard PATH, MANPATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables). A single user command, use, can be invoked to source the appropriate environment information into the users&#39; current shell.</p>

<p>How does it work?The Extras Bridge dynamically linked library is being registered with Skype as a Type-B plugin. To fully support runtime load/unload feature, it spawns a child process Extras Host. Together they will act as lightweight mediator between Skype and your plugin implementation. The host process inspects all the dll assemblies, from within its own directory, looking for first non-abstract public class implementing IPluginFactory. When found, it is going to use it to instantiate your ISkypePluginB implementation. </p>

 title : The etaf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ETAF is a test automation framework.  It&#39;s purpose is to provide:  A browser based IDE to create and remotely execute tests  A versioning capability for both tests and test results  A method to review tests and collaborate  A method to install/upgrade a system, monitor it and catalog it.  A method to trigger executions of tests and to trigger notifications based on execution/pass/fail events </p>

<p>The test scripts are in KSH and could be in any Unux based scripting language. The mechanism of crawling a system to either monitor it or collect logs or install/update packages is based on SSH.  So again this is heavily Unix based. </p>

<p>The reporting is mostly table based with graphs for performance.  The graphs are generated using gnuplot.  The tables are HTML tables generated from delimited flat files like CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.  All data is in flat files and there is no relational database like MySql or any other scripting language like PhP.  The KSH scripts depend heavily on regularly used UNIX tools like -- wc, grep, find, ls, df, vmstat, top, sar, iostat, join, awk, sed, sort, ps, etc.  In a way the tool is meant to simulate how a tester would test on an UNIX system if a script or Web framework was not available.  This is meant so that there is no extra learning required on the part of tester and whatever learning is needed to use the GUI is hopefully very intuitive. </p>

<p>This project was originally started in sourceforge and is at:

 summary : <p>Perl Seminar New York, sponsor of monthly technical meetings in New York City since 2000, announces the initiation of &#39;Phalanx Phoenix: Mentored Maintenance of CPAN Modules.&#39;</p>

<p>The original Phalanx project, initiated by Andy Lester, aimed at improving the code, testing and documentation of important, non-core Perl modules on CPAN. A Perl Seminar NY team met in several sessions between January and June 2005 to &#39;phalanx&#39; CPAN distributions Text-Template and HTML-Template. We learned a tremendous amount about code maintenance and quality assurance -- and had a good time in our face-to-face collective hacking sessions. We reported on our efforts at YAPC::NA::2005 in Toronto.</p>

<p>In the last year-and-a-half the Phalanx project has largely been dormant. In part this was because the CPAN module authors on whose distributions the various Phalanx teams worked were not obliged to incorporate the teams&#39; work into new versions of those CPAN distributions.</p>

<p>In that same time period, however, there has been more attention paid to the need to guarantee continued maintenance of CPAN distributions when their authors, due to changes in life circumstances, no longer can give them the maintenance attention they need. The Perl community appears to lack a central place where CPAN authors who need to transfer maintenance responsibilities for their distributions can hook up with potential new maintainers.</p>

<p>Rising from the ashes like the storied Phoenix, the Perl Seminar NY&#39;s Phalanx project will address this problem via mentored maintenance of CPAN modules conducted in collective hacking sessions. We seek to match up current CPAN authors/maintainers who need to transfer or share maintenance responsibilities with new CPAN participants who either can immediately assume maintenance or who can aim to do so when mentored by other current CPAN authors.</p>

<p>We are currently assembling a list of CPAN distributions whose authors are ready, willing and able to transfer or share maintenance responsibilities. Once we have that list, each participating Perl Seminar NY member will pick a module to work on and develop a plan of work for that module. We will discuss the plans of work face-to-face in collective hacking sessions conducted in a suitable location. When the collective feels the plan is viable, we&#39;ll ask the current author/maintainer to sign the participant on as co-maintainer or to transfer primary maintenance responsibility outright. The collective will then hold each participant to a high standard of quality in module maintenance. We would like to begin our F2F sessions in January 2007.</p>

<p>We&#39;re conceiving of Phalanx Phoenix primarily as a collective hacking experience, so we view the face-to-face sessions as very important -- and also as the most fun! But between sessions most of the work will be conducted online, so we don&#39;t want to exclude Perl hackers and would-be module maintainers who can&#39;t make our in-person sessions.</p>

 title : The gwt-simple-persistence Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Simple persistence layer for GWT1.4 using BeanUtils, Guice and Berkeley DB Java Edition. </p>

<p>Requires Java5. </p>

<p>GWT, Guice, Persistence - together at last! </p>

<p>GWT is a brilliant, time-saving technology, but most developers using it quickly hit a massive brick wall: persistence. Modern persistence technologies rely on Java5+ language additions such as generics and annotations, and GWT&#39;s java-&gt;javascript compiler is only Java 1.4 compatible. </p>

<p>So what to do? I&#39;ve scoured the web and seen many solutions, most of which involve some messy duplication of beans using code generation - in other words, copying data between a GWT-compatible DAO and a JPA/Hibernate/Spring-enhanced DAO on every read and write.  </p>

<p>This approach has a few problems, most notably maintainability and performance. I haven&#39;t looking very hard at the performance side (my app is not that taxing) but in terms of code maintainability it&#39;s a nightmare - the very antithesis of clean code which modern language features are supposed to prevent. </p>

<p>Now, GWT 1.5 will supposedly have Java5 language feature support, though what form that takes and what caveats (if any) it entails remain to be seen. </p>

<p>In the meantime, those of us who need a quick, simple solution to storing and retrieving a bunch of GWT DAOs are stuck in hacky-solution-land. </p>

<p>Until now!  </p>

<p>Thanks to commons-beanutils, Berkeley DB Java Edition and a bit of messing about, I present: simple, fast GWT persistence!</p>

 summary : <p>H8A8 is intended as an alternative to XDoclet for Hibernate for those working with Hibernate 3 under Java 5. </p>

<p>H8A8 is an alternative to the Hibernate Annotations project. The Hibernate Annotations project uses annotations from the EJB3 specification and doesn&#39;t currently (summer 2005) allow the use of all hibernate features. </p>

<p>H8A8 instead makes available nearly all the mapping options currently available in Hibernate&#39;s xml mapping format as Java 5 annotations. Moving to H8A8 from hand-written mapping xml files or xdoclet-generated mapping files should be reasonably straightforward.</p>

 title : The javango Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Javango? </p>

<p>Javango is an experiment at porting some concepts from the Python web framework Django to native Java.  It is not an attempt to duplicate all Django funcitonlality or do some type of line-by-line port,  however syntax and concepts should match as close as possible.   </p>

<p>What is the current status of Javango? </p>

<p>Update (Jan 14, 2008) I just uploaded an update (0.1e) that integrates Guice with core Javango, enjoy. </p>

<p>Update (Jan 9, 2008) The latest download (0.1d) should have most basic functionality of the polls app and the auto generated admin app.   </p>

<p>At this time (Jan 4, 2008) Javango is simple a proof of concept for the View layer of the Django framework.  Django has been described as a View Model Template based design,  Javango currently uses Hibernate for the model layer and Freemarker for the template layer. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Django is (in my opinion) the best web development framework I have seen.  An effort is under way to get Django running under Jython,  however I get paid to write Java code,  not Python. </p>

<p>Future plans? </p>

<p>As of now (Jan 4, 2008) there are currently no plans for Javango,  I am releasing only to see if there is any community interest.  </p>

<p>Support? </p>

<p>None really,  but I have setup a group and will try to answer questions. </p>

<p>Does it have the cool admin site? </p>

<p>Not at this time,  although I believe it is possible with a little effort. </p>

<p>Update Jan 5, 2008,  Some basic admin functionality has been added to the 0.1b download.  Try it out http://localhost:8080/polls/admin/  </p>

<p>Update Jan 7, 2008, More admin is working now,  shamelessly grabbed the CSS from django,  more foreign key support.  Most basic CRUD is working. </p>

<p>How? </p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<p>JDK 1.5 or greater </p>

<p>Maven (tested with 2.0.4) </p>

<p>Run the polls sample app: </p>

<p>Install and get maven running Download and extract javango-complete.tgz From the root javango-complete directory type &#39;mvn jetty:run&#39; Browse to &#39;http://localhost:8080/polls/admin/resetdb/&#39; (This creates the tables and adds sample data,  only required on the first run or if you blow away the polltestdb files.) Browse to &#39;http://localhost:8080/polls/admin/&#39; setup a poll and some choices. Browse to &#39;http://localhost:8080/polls/&#39; vote away. </p>

<p>The code for the polls app is at src/main/java/javango/polls hopefully a basic understanding of Django will be all you need to understand the code (hint, look in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml to see how the settings class is configured).</p>

 summary : <p>OSGI+Spring+Hibernate+...完美解决方案[非SpringDM] 
<br/>导论 “世间本无事，庸人自扰之” SpringDM就是一庸人！ </p>

<p>最近，我做一个项目需要编写Eclipse的插件。我想在Eclipse插件中使用Spring和Hibernate。但却遇到了巨大的问题。 按照Spring组织的提示，我使用SpringDM1.02编写Spring程序（后来用SpringDM1.1，SpringDM又叫SpringOSGI）。但是总是遇到种种问题。特别是Spring管理下的Hibernate，总是无法找到Hibernate的配置文件。 </p>

<p>到了后来，连Eclipse也挂了。每次重设Eclipse的目标插件集合的时候，Eclipse都会死掉！ </p>

<p>终于，我再也无法忍受SpringDM的折磨了！ 我告诉自己，是时候反思了！ </p>

<p>终于，我发现了SpringDM根本就是一个完全、彻底失败，无用的废物！ 所有的问题都是SpringDM造成的！ 而不是SpringDM所说的，OSGI，Hibernate等等其他软件造成的！ </p>

<p>我终于发现了OSGI+Spring+Hibernate+...完美解决方案。 不敢藏私，拿出来给各位共享。 </p>

<p>问题的根源—ClassLoader OSGI提供了自己的ClassLoader。每一个OSGI的插件，都有一个独立的ClassLoader被使用。这样就实现了各个插件的独立性。 一个JVM上可以运行无数个OSGI插件，每一个OSGI插件都是独立的，除非发布为OSGI服务，或者发布自己Package。 SpringDM的工作原理是这样子的：（我猜想的） 1，SpringDM是一个OSGI插件。作为一个一般的插件进行部署。 2，SpringDM一旦启动，就会探查所有其他Active状态的插件。 1）MANIFEST.MF中没有Spring的头，如果有，执行该配置。 2）如果MANIFEST.MF中没有Spring的头，探查META-INF/spring/目录下有没有.xml文件，如果有，它也是一个SpringDM项目。 </p>

<p>SpringDM探查其他插件的资源，应该使用的是这些插件的BundleContext对象来实现的。 
<br/>另外，SpringDM应该注册了OSGI的事件，这样，其他插件启动，关闭，都会通知SpringDM。 </p>

<p>如果SpringDM发现一个插件是SpringDM插件。就导入该插件中的Spring配置文件，创建ApplicationContext。然后，把该ApplicationContext作为OSGI服务发布。 如果插件中需要显式的getBean()方法获得对象，就使用它来获得。 </p>

<p>SpringDM的问题 SpringDM的DM----动态管理，这个设计似乎很巧妙！ 刚开始我也被SpringDM的这一“强大功能”所折服。 但是，实际上，SpringDM的所有问题根源，就在这里！ </p>

<p>SpringDM实际上是在SpringDM这个插件中为所有Spring插件创建ApplicationContext的！ 显然，此时使用的ClassLoader是SpringDM这个插件的ClassLoader，而不是实际的Spring项目的插件的ClassLoader。 并且，当前线程中的ClassLoader，也是SpringDM插件的ClassLoader。 这样，就产生了问题。 如，Hibernate，它内部使用当前线程中的ClassLoader来载入配置文件。 Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() 绝大部分现有Java代码都使用这样的代码来获得ClassLoader来载入资源，动态创建类。 现在，使用了SpringDM，所有这些代码的ClassLoader都会出现问题！！！都无法找到资源！！！ 这些日子里，我都快被这样的问题给逼疯了！ SpringDM的谎言 SpringDM的官方文档，把这些问题的责任推给了Hibernate和OSGI。它说，由于OSGI环境下ClassLoader的特殊性，因此使用Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()得到的ClassLoader都是不正确的。 应该使用BundleActivator接口的实现类的Classloader来得到正确的ClassLoader。 </p>

<p>而Hibernate这样的设计时未考虑OSGI环境的类库，在OSGI环境中出错是不可避免的。 因此，Hibernate应该修改代码，以适应OSGI环境。 </p>

<p>而我上了Hibernate网站，没有看到HibernateOSGI项目。 </p>

<p>我看到有不少朋友在网上写了一些补丁代码，让Hibernate在SpringDM环境下正确运行。 看来，我们还应该忙着修改数以亿行计的Java代码，把获得ClassLoader的代码修改掉，否则在SpringDM的OSGI环境下就会报错！ </p>

<p>悲惨！！！如果真是如此，OSGI真的没有存在的价值了！！！ </p>

<p>事实 但是，事实并非如此！！！ </p>

<p>如果不使用SpringDM，直接在OSGI插件中使用Hibernate，或者Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()，都可以正确载入资源。 因为，OSGI插件使用的ClassLoader是可以直接载入OSGI插件的所有资源的。并且，当前线程中的ClassLoader，也是当前OSGI插件使用的ClassLoader。 </p>

<p>因此，SpringDM在说谎！ 
<br/>SpringDM的动态创建ApplicationContext的机制是一系列问题的源泉。 
<br/>OSGI+Spring+Hibernate+...完美解决方案[非SpringDM] 只要不使用SpringDM的动态创建ApplicationContext机制，就可以避免上述种种问题。 试一下在BundleActivator接口中直接使用new  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext()的方式创建ApplicationContext。 结果失败了！ </p>

<p>通过Debug，我发现是Spring自己的一些特殊处理方式使它在OSGI环境下失败。 </p>

<p>然后，我研究了SpringDM1.1的API，找到了在插件中直接创建ApplicationContext的方法。</p>
 summary : <p>This project aims to quickly generate blank web applications based on Spring, Struts 2, JPA (Hibernate as the provider) and HSQL, Struts Convention and Struts REST, and as little XML as possible. Generation of CRUDs will be supported as well.  </p>

<p>This project seeks to help people to get started with Struts 2, and generate CRUDs for prototyping or leaning the supported frameworks.  </p>

<p>This is not, and will not try to be generic and feature rich, like Appfuse. Only the specified frameworks will be supported, but most importantly, this is my pet project for learning Groovy, you have been warned! :)</p>

 summary : <p>AudioReaper is a modular software synthesizer, like Buzz, Reason or Psycle, but its core is written in pure Java, using Swing as a user-interface. </p>

<p>A modular software synthesizer is a piece of software that mimics the gear used in a recording studio. It uses one or more &#39;machines&#39;, which can be either instruments (like a Piano, or Keyboard) or effects (like Echo, or Chorus), and connects those into a logical flow, from instruments to effects and finally to the master. This is the actual output.  </p>

<p>By creating musical scores in the pattern-editor melodies and effect-controls can be programmed, or played into by a MIDI connected device. These patterns can be placed in the sequencer a whole virtual composition can be made, which can be played real-time or exported to WAV.</p>

 summary : <p>This project has merged with the vimplugin project. All future work is now being carried out at vimplugin. </p>

<p>  This powerful Eclipse plugin brings your favorite editor in the place of the eclipse editor. This way the user has a choice among several popular editors and the built-in eclipse editors. But your editor must support an interface that follows Netbeans external editor protocol (More..) to be able to use it through our plugin. </p>

<p>As of now, Vim and XEmacs only have this interface. More editors can be integrated as well although the External Editor team is focusing on the above two famous editors. </p>

<p>At the moment this project is being undertaken as part of Google Summer of Code 2007. The purpose of the SOC project is just to provide a Vim Plugin for Eclipse and we have decided that the Netbeans external editor protocol is the best way to provide this. So at the moment we are just focusing on getting Vim working and provide no support for any other editors. We will look into supporting XEmacs (and perhaps others) once Vim works with Eclipse fairly well. </p>

 summary : <p>OverviewThis is command completition and parameter tracking script for AutoHotKey language. It is made to help you edit your code faster, to locate exact parameter position with complex commands (like InputBox), and generaly, provide you help with AutoHotKey without ever leaving your editor.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FeaturesWorks in every place having keyboard input and generaly can be made to work with any  editor around.  Info window that contains all commands, AHK and user functions that start with currently typed word part.  ActiveGoTo integration (F1)  Parameter display and tracking.  Full help on last typed command.  Works on already typed sentences.  Every aspect of script is customizable (colors, transparency, hotkeys ...)  UsageTo make ISense monitoring your input, title of your editor window must have word &quot;.ahk&quot; somewhere and you must press SPACE, TAB or ENTER. After typing 3 letters Info window will be shown. It contains AHK commands starting with letters you typed. If you continue to type Info window will repopulate commands in the list based on the last letters you typed. The list will be returned to previous state when you delete charachters.  </p>

<p>While Info window is visible, use arrows, pgup, pgdn, home &amp; end to select the desired command. Press TAB or COMMA, or CLICK to evaluate the selection. If you don&#39;t select anything first command in the Info window will be evaluated.  </p>

<p>After evaluation the script will change mode to parameter tracking. Current parameter will be shown bold.  </p>

<p>To show full help for current command press press CTRL SPACE while tooltip is visible. You can scroll help using arrows, pgup, pgdn, home &amp; end.  </p>

<p>To cancel any ISense window at any moment pres ESC, or move around the code.  </p>

<p>You can also press CTRL SPACE on any part of any line. ISense will grab that line and try to locate the AHK command and parameter at cursor position. This procedure is editor specific so if it doesn&#39;t work with your editor, choose different method or write your own.  </p>

<p>NotesSome editors have custom controls for text editing so some function may not work correctly or not work at all</p>

 title : The newac Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>New Audio Components (NewAC) are designed to help your Delphi programs perform different sound processing tasks. With NewAC you can play audio stored in many formats (wav, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Monkey Audio, WavPack, MP3, Windows WMA, DTS, AC-3 (Dobly Surround), VOB (DVD files)). The playback is performed in the background, and although your application can control it (stop, pause, move forward and backward, play in a loop) it can perform other tasks while audio plays. Both DirectSound and ASIO may be used for the playback and recording. </p>

<p>You can play sound not only from external files, but also from sound resources embedded into your program, and, in fact, from any stream providing audio data. But NewAC not only allows you to play sound, you can acquire audio data from such input devices as microphone or CD and encode it into any of the audio formats mentioned above. While playing audio stored in a file or while writing audio content to a file you can manipulate tags supported by the chosen audio format. </p>

<p>In addition to all this, NewAC can perform some audio editing tasks, like mixing and concatenating audio streams, selecting fragments of streams, and performing sample rate and bits per sample conversions.</p>

 title : The rox-find Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionMany text editors have a &#39;Find in Files&#39; function which shows exactly where in each file some text occurs. Then you can select each instance and jump to that location in the file(s) you are interested in. ROX Edit does not have this feature. So rather than add it to ROX Edit, I figured it would be better as a standalone utility - then you could use it with your favorite editor. </p>

<p>Instructions, etc.Find is simply a shell for find|grep or equivalent. It comes pre-installed with typical settings for these command line apps that should work for most people. If you have different needs, or have different find|search utilities, you can probably (possibly?) edit the standard settings to work. </p>

<p>To start a search you must enter a Path to search in (using &#39;~&#39; for your home directory works), a Pattern of text to search for (either plain text, or a regular expression, or whatever your custom find utility wants), and finally a Files specification to describe what files to search in and which to ignore (e.g. .txt). </p>

<p>NOTE: You cannot execute a Find until all 3 text fields have some data in them. This is because just searching for files without specifying content is not what this application is all about. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Clicking the Find button will execute the find|grep command in the background and capture its output in the results window. While the Find is running, the Find button will be slightly grayed out and effectively becomes the Cancel button. The search results window is NOT cleared after each search, so that search results can be combined and reviewed later. Each set of results is headed by a row that shows the search criteria for that search, and allows that section to be collapsed/expanded. </p>

<p>If you double-click on the results in the Text or Line columns, your editor will open the file at the selected line (depending on which editor you are using). If you double-click on the Filename column, a ROX Filer window will open showing the location of that file. </p>

<p>Each of the Path | Pattern | Files fields will store up to the 10 most recently used entries. </p>

<p>There are options to Match or ignore text case (the Pattern, not the Files), Match whole words or not, Ignore binary files and search only the specified path or all of its subdirectories too. Each of these is configurable in the Preferences dialog. </p>

<p>The Find Command is defined in the Preferences dialog in the first text box that appears. </p>

<p>By default the following is used: </p>

<p>&#39;find &quot;$P&quot; $R -name &quot;$F&quot; -exec grep -Hn $C $B &quot;$T&quot; &quot;{}&quot; \;&#39;This can be modified to do things like ignore certain directories. For example to ignore all Subversion (or CVS?) hidden folders, use the following: </p>

<p>&#39;find &quot;$P&quot; $R -name &quot;$F&quot; \! -path &quot;*.svn*&quot; -exec grep -Hn $C $B $W &quot;$T&quot; &quot;{}&quot; \;&#39;If you know how to use find and grep well, you can customize this to suit your needs. If not, the default should work for most cases. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The find command contains several optional items that are replaced at runtime with different content as specified in the preferences dialog and controlled by the options checkboxes in the main UI window. </p>

<p>For each checkbox state, there is a text field that specifies what to add to the find command string. If the text field is empty, then nothing is added (but the replacement key is removed). Again, the defaults are chosen to work with standard (GNU?) find and grep, but these can be changed to suit. </p>

<p>So, the original find command: </p>

<p>&#39;find &quot;$P&quot; $R -name &quot;$F&quot; -exec grep -Hn $C $B &quot;$T&quot; &quot;{}&quot; \;&#39;is changed at runtime, in a typical case, to something like: </p>

<p>&#39;find &quot;/home/user/textfiles&quot; -name &quot;*.txt&quot; -exec grep -Hn -I &quot;money&quot; &quot;{}&quot; \;&#39;Finally, the Edit command allows you to specify your favorite editor to open the files and (hopefully) jump to the location of the found text. </p>

<p>By default the Edit command is blank. In this case, Find uses ROX&#39; built-in &#39;text/plain&#39; file handler to open the files. However, in this case the editor will not jump to the site of the found text. If you use ROX Edit, you can use the following command to enable this: </p>

<p>/path/to/ROX-apps/Edit/AppRun $File -l $LineWhere $File is replaced with the filename, and $Line is the location of the found text. Many other text editors can also be made to function in this manner. </p>

 title : The weboca Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introduction to WeBoCaWeBoCa is an advanced and altered implementation of JBootCat (a Java implemention of the BootCat scripts written by Marco Baroni et al for acquiring corpora from the Internet).  Written by Michael Drayson, WeBoCa will allow users to create a corpus from a range of search engines, and then conduct processing on the corpus in order to tidy up / manipulate the corpus in a range of ways. </p>

<p>The BootCat scripts are of great interest to linguists, translators and anyone researching such techniques for academic purposes.  </p>

<p>While the main goal of JBootCat was &#39;to encapsulate the BootCat functionality within a user-friendly desktop application&#39;, WeBoCa looks to improve upon the open-source application, and increase its functionality in terms of both corpus collection, and knowledge discovery from within the corpus created. </p>

<p>The application is now in a state ready for public release. </p>

<p>WeBoCa FeaturesWeBoCa includes the following features: </p>

<p>Vertical / Horizontal corpus creation  Google / Yahoo search engine implementation  Define additional search parameters  Define a word limit Define a page size limit Save URLs used in downloading Advanced URL processing including; Remove stored URLs as terms Remove non alpha-numerical terms Sort corpus Convert corpus terms to lower case Remove non-unique corpus terms Generate frequency count Running WeBoCaIn order to run WeBoCa, first please ensure you have the Java Virtual Environment 1.4 or greater installed.  Then, if using Windows download the latest WeBoCa Windows executable archive.  If prefered, or using non-Windows system, download the latest WeBoCa Distribution release, navigate to extracted folder and type &#39;java -jar WeBoCa.jar&#39; at the terminal. </p>

<p>You can also access the latest WeBoCa source code by connecting to it&#39;s Subversion (SVN) repository from your favourite IDE.  WeBoCa was developed in Netbeans with the SVN pluggin and this is the recommended IDE. </p>

<p>Any issues or problems? Contact Michael Drayson at weboca.info@gmail.com </p>

 title : The bspawner Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Erlang nodes can communicate over the network if they find each other. You can send a message to any process (differ from OS process) through its Pid – even if the process is on another node. </p>

<p>Although you don&#39;t have to know where processes are, it is still up to the erlang programmer to decide which node initially spawns a task on which node as there is no inherent way to make use of multiple nodes , even though they recognize each other &amp; can message-pass between them. </p>

<p>Hence, this project attempts to load-balance the task of spawning tasks across multiple nodes . The steps involved can be isolated into a couple of distinct problems. </p>

<p>Steps </p>

<p>  1. deciding which node needs to spawn a task
<br/>  2. communicating across these nodes
<br/>  3. maintaining a record of nodes, added /removed nodes ,etcThis project in its essence, deals with the first part and the implementation of the message passing begins with the &quot;messenger.erl&quot; program located at http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html and will be ported to different message-passing, load-balancing and node-information maintenance based on feedback,suggestions ,comments, and further changes inspired by the growing involvement of the erlang community &amp; encouragement from #erlang in particular. </p>

<p>However, since the project is still in its early stages - better clarity &amp; flexibility about which node takes load, but which node gets the result &amp; how to communicate with least latency, is sought for. </p>

<p>For a fault-tolerant and inbuilt version provided within erlang , check the pool module </p>

<p>pool can be used to run a set of Erlang nodes as a pool of computational processors. It is organized as a master and a set of slave nodes and includes the following features:</p>

<p>    * The slave nodes send regular reports to the master about their current load.
<br/>    * Queries can be sent to the master to determine which node will have the least load.</p>

 title : The croqodile Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: Croqodile is now hosted on github: croqodile </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Croqodile is an AS3/Erlang implementation of the Croquet project&#39;s TeaTime protocol. </p>

<p>Croqodile abstracts networking and state synchronization to allow for rapid development of multi-user, richly-collaborative flash applications. </p>

<p>Brief IntroCroqodile differs from Croquet in many details (it is a far less ambitious project), but the general architecture is similar, so it is important that you read (or at least skim) the  Croquet project http://www.opencroquet.org/index.php/System_Overview before continuing. </p>

<p>A Croqodile system will consist of three components. Two of these components will run on the client&#39;s machine and are implemented entirely in Flash Actionscript - they are the Controller and the IslandReplica. The third component is the router, a thin server implemented in erlang that will serve as a middle-man between the many clients. </p>

<p>In most cases, Croqodile&#39;s router and Controller can be used as-is. The IslandReplica, on the other hand, must be extended to suit the needs of the specific application. We will be looking at the Croqodile distribution&#39;s whiteboard demo as an example. </p>

<br/>&#39;drawSegment&#39; and &#39;clearWithWhite&#39; are private utility methods - pretty self explanatory. </p>

<p>&#39;freeze&#39; and &#39;unfreeze&#39; are an important part of the Croqodile infrastructure. When a new client connects to the router they must somehow synchronize their IslandReplica with everyone else&#39;s. In order to bring the new user into the Island-in-progress, Croqodile will call the &#39;freeze&#39; method of an existing client&#39;s IslandReplica. The resulting frozen IslandReplica will be serialized and sent through the router to the new client, where it will be passed to a fresh IslandReplica&#39;s &#39;unfreeze&#39; method. At that point the two IslandReplicas should (and must) be identical. </p>

<p>There is only one method in the &#39;External Interface&#39; section of the class, &#39;addSegment&#39;. This is the only method that the clients of our Island will be calling, and we must now add the code that will generate these calls. What follows is just some standard, event-handling flex code - first the mxml: </p>

<br/>    }
<br/>}</p>

<p>First, in the &#39;onConnectButtonClicked&#39; handler, we create our Controller and our IslandReplica. The Controller immediately (auto-magically) connects to our router (which must already be running). </p>

<p>Now that everything is hooked up, we can finally send a message to the Island. </p>

<p>Pay attention to the line this.islandRef.send(&quot;addSegment&quot;, segment ); .  </p>

<p>&#39;islandRef&#39; is an object of FarRef type. Whenever a message is &#39;sent&#39; to a FarRef, that message is passed to the local Controller. The Controller knows to transmit the message to the router. The router will then broadcast the message to all the Controllers of all the clients, and then each of the Controllers will tell their respective IslandReplicas to execute the message.  </p>

 title : The geoping Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThe GeoWeb is inspired by the Web itself and particularly the rich set of tools built for Weblogs. Publishing, distributing and consuming maps and spatial data is as simple as publishing a weblog and running an RSS aggregator. </p>

<p>However there is a crucial component missing in the GeoWeb: Ping servers, exemplified by Weblogs.com and blo.gs, which provide a simple central point to receive updates of new content, and distribute those updates to interested consumers. </p>

<p>geoping hopes to serve the commons, so that all parts of the GeoWeb have equal access to updates. </p>

<p>Technical OverviewThis overview is intended to give a high level sketch of the technical solution. There are four components to the service: </p>

<p>a JSON/XML RPC and RESTful API; a web form for submitting updates; publishing of latest updates on the website; an archive of updates. </p>

<p>Implementationgeoping is built with Erlang, a functional programming language, which is ideally suited for concurrent, reliable applications. Erlang achieves this by using lightweight processes, and message passing between these processes. Further it has no shared state threading, thus allowing for lock-free concurrency and keeping the entire system more robust. </p>

<p>Overview of different processesHere is a brief overview of the different Erlang processes inside the Erlang virtual machine: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Update notifications will be stored in a queue. A spam checking process will check the frequency of update of each resource, rejecting those occurring too often. And as a crude change detection, it will make a HEAD request to see if the size has changed since last update. If the resource has been updated, information on that resource will be updated in the database.    A separate process, the update checker,  will periodically query for the latest changes from the database, publish changes in html and xml, and archive the published list. </p>

<p>Finaly, a Webserver together with the database and file storage engine, will respond to REST or RPC pings and also serve the static webpages. </p>

<p>Initial prototypeTo benchmark the Erlang server, a Merb server will be quickly prototyped. Merb, which is a simple and extremely fast Ruby framework, is also ideal for a ping server. If the content-type of the RPC calls are the ones for xml or json, Merb automatically converts the call to a Ruby params hash-table, which can then be processed and a resulting hash-table can be coerced into a xml or json response, without the need for templates which would slow the service down. </p>

<p>Further, Merb comes with a background worker, which can execute some action after the request dispatch has finished. Such a worker, could then be used as a spam checker and also to query the latest updates periodically. </p>

<p>Site mock-upsThe initial site mock-ups are on this wiki page: SiteMockups </p>

<p>Proposed Schedule (TODO)Week 1Initial prototype and benchmark: </p>

<p>Erlang prototype with a basic ping api; Merb prototype with similar api; Benchmarking on the same machine under similar loads. </p>

<p>Week 3Initial work on the spam checking worker task/process: </p>

<p>Need to find good heuristics for ping spams; Implementation and testing; Integration into the main service. </p>

<p>Week 5Initial work on the database query task/process: </p>

<p>Create a model for storage of the urls; Create a periodic worker task that queries the latest urls; Implement the witting of the changes.xml file; Implement the logic for archiving and retrieving the urls. </p>

<p>Week 7Basic REST api and webforms </p>

<p>Also the static webpages and info for using the API. </p>

 summary : <p>What is nsplit and npmap?nsplit is a n-process parallel/concurrent mapping function library based on Erlang/OTP rpc:async_call/4 function.   </p>

<p>The module has an external function: </p>

<p>npmap(N, F, L): spawn N processes to lists:map(F, L) </p>

<p>The npmap/3 function is also available as an independent module npmap.erl from nsplit-0.4. </p>

<p>deprecated functionsThe module has two deprecated external functions: </p>

<p>list_nsplit(N, L): splits a list L into N-member two-level lists example: list_nsplit(3, [a,b,c,d,e,f,g]) -&gt; [[a,b,c],[d,e],[f,g]] pmap(F, L): spawn parallel processes to lists:map(F, L) </p>

 title : The paralog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Prolog interpreter written in Erlang. </p>

<p>Goals of this project: </p>

<p>Be able to embed a Prolog interpreter in an Erlang runtime, calling into Prolog for queries and returning the bindings as Erlang proplists. Be able to call out from Prolog to Erlang to make use of the Erlang runtime, including Erlang libraries for network and system calls, etc. Enable users to write pluggable adapters for databases (Mnesia, RDBMSs, document-oriented stores a la CouchDB) so that those databases may be searched using Prolog queries. Provide users with a choice of algorithms for searching the query state-space.  Allow algorithms which support it to be parallelized across many processes.</p>
 title : The pranayama Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This Erlang project originated as an offshoot of another Erlang project of mine -  The (Mock) Exchange; while I could have used something like Yaws, I was intrigued by the idea of building my own server. </p>

<p>My architecture is simple: the server acts as a filter, intercepting the &#39;raw&#39; http request which it then transforms into an erlang record; this record is sent off to the appropriate delegate; this delegate is any globally registered erlang process which can take responsibility for generating the response; this response is sent back to Pranayama which transforms into the &#39;raw&#39; http response, sending it back to the client. </p>

<p>One of the design aims was to limit the coupling between the server and the various web apps which used it; besides the inclusion of a single .hrl file, a web app must simply register with the server; if the server crashes, losing its registration data, all web apps are informed so that they may re-register. </p>

<p>About a year ago, I started to learn Erlang part-time; I learned much from the projects of others and wanted to bring something to the table that might be of similar aid to others. </p>

<p>Feedback is certainly welcome; this is my first participation in an open source project, so I&#39;d appreciate any guidance. </p>

 title : The chronologies Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Chronologies is a version control system that makes branches first-class citizens and the most important unit of versioning. It&#39;s distributed, using explicit or implicit merging to handle concurrent modifications, communication protocol and mime-content agnostic. It is loosely based on concepts of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanices and applies them to versioning nodes. A node is either a file, a directory or a link and it&#39;s localized by three dimensions: path (i.e. spatial), revision (i.e. temporal, representing an instant) and  branch (i.e. it&#39;s timeline, as in alternate universes). A repository is a collection of branches, but different repositories cohabit the same multiverse: in  a theoretical sense it doesn&#39;t matter in which repository a branch resides, it can be forked and end up in another repository located in a different machine. </p>

<p>It&#39;s written in Haskell and it support usage as a FUSE module.</p>

 title : The git-idea Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>git-ideagit-idea is a plugin for Intellij IDEA that provides integration with the git revision control system. git-idea provides only a subset of the functionality you&#39;ll need for working with git, but it handles most IDE-appropriate actions. </p>

<p>This is an alpha project. It&#39;s not well-tested, although it&#39;s used constantly by several developers. Please provide feedback, and feel free to open tickets for bugs or feature requests. </p>

<p>What&#39;s it Dogit-idea provides the following: </p>

<p>add delete rename move tag file history </p>

<p>git-idea integrates with IDEA and tracks it&#39;s filesystem changes as you work, adding/deleting/renaming/moving files. git-idea also provides standard vcs functions via the normal IDEA vcs menus. You can explicitly add files, commit some or all of the changes in your project, view file history for any file, etc. </p>

<p>You can use the git external git tools, like the command-line tools, in conjunction with git-idea in IDEA. Use the Refresh File Status function if things look out of sync. </p>

<p>More functionality is still to come. </p>

<p>Installation and ConfigurationYou must have git 1.5 installed.  </p>

<p>Download the latest build of git-idea. Unzip it and move the now unzipped &#39;git-idea&#39; directory it into your plugins dir. </p>

<p>In any project needing git, enable the git vcs as follows: </p>

<p>Open IDEA&#39;s Settings panel, and select Version Control. Under Directory Version Control Settings, point to the root(s) of your git repository on disk (be sure they&#39;re accurate!) and select the &#39;git&#39; VCS for each root. Directory entries MUST be at the root direcotry of a git repository, even if it&#39;s outside of your project. Click &quot;Configure VCS...&quot; and select git Configure the plugin it so it can find your &#39;git&#39; executable. You can use the &quot;test executable&quot; button to make sure the plugin is able to find your git installation using the path you provided. That&#39;s it! </p>

<p>Implementationgit-idea works by creating external processes executing the &#39;git&#39; executable and screen-scraping the results. </p>

<p>git-idea is implemented in groovy and java 1.5. It was built using git 1.5.4.4 and Intellij IDEA 7.0.3 #7757. It will probably work with slightly earlier builds of IDEA 7. git-idea will NOT work with IDEA 6. </p>

<p>Source Code AccessBuilds can downloaded here at google, but the source code is stored (naturally) in a git repository at gitorious.org. You can clone the repository with either of the following commands: git clone http://git.gitorious.org/git-idea/mainline.git or git clone git://gitorious.org/git-idea/mainline.git</p>

 title : The lua-alchemy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionBackgroundLua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to bind them together. </p>

<p>A demo can be found here: http://lua-alchemy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/index.html </p>

<p>Can you help us? </p>

<p>LuaLua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language. 
<br/>Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. 
<br/>-- http://lua.org/about.html 
<br/>Adobe FlashAdobe Flash (previously called &quot;Macromedia Flash&quot;&#39;) is a set of multimedia software created by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet applications. 
<br/>-- http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Flash 
<br/>Adobe AlchemyWith Alchemy, Web application developers can now reuse hundreds of millions of lines of existing open source C and C++ client or server-side code on the Flash Platform.  Alchemy brings the power of high performance C and C++ libraries to Web applications with minimal degradation on AVM2.  The C/C++ code is compiled to ActionScript 3.0 as a SWF or SWC that runs on Adobe Flash Player 10 or Adobe AIR 1.5. 
<br/>    </p>

<p>-- http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/ </p>

<p>MotivationWe need Lua Alchemy to... </p>

<p>...To use run-time dynamic programming language (Lua) within the Flash framework.  ...To reuse existing Lua code for the Flash-based utilities ...To get a great cross-platform back-end (Flash) for (simpler) Lua-based games ...To have fun with awesome new technology :-) OrganizationSitesMain place for collaboration: GoogleProjects (file releases, wiki, issues) Main place for development: GitHub (Git source control) Developer&#39;s mailing list: GoogleGroups (to be made open for public as soon as we&#39;re ready) LicenseLua Achemy is licensed at the same license as Lua 5.1: the MIT license. This means that Lua Alchemy is free software and can be used for both academic and commercial purposes at absolutely no cost. </p>

 title : The mock4as Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mock4AS is a simple Mock Object Library for ActionScript3. </p>

<p>The current version of Mock4AS provides a minimalistic Mock Objects library fulfilling the basic Unit Tests mocking needs. </p>

<p>To get started download the latest version of Mock.as and add it to your project. </p>

<p>What is Mock4AS?Mock4as is a simple ActionScript3 library used to verify the interaction between dependent components. </p>

<p>How to use Mock4asUsing a Mock4AS for unit testing involves the following steps:  </p>

<p>Create a mock object class 2 Instantiate a mock object  
<br/>3 Create expectations for the mock  
<br/>4 Inject the mock  
<br/>5 Exercise the mock object 
<br/>6 Verify the the mock expectations 
<br/>ExampleWe will use the Greeting example to illustrate the basic functionality of Mock4AS. </p>

<p>The Greeting component says Hello in any language. </p>

<p>Greeting uses a Translator component to translate “Hello” from English to the selected language. E.g. greeting.sayHello(“Portuguese”, “Paulo”) should return “Ola Paulo” </p>

<p>ITranslator is an interface containing the translate method – parameters from, to and word, which returns the translated word; e.g translate(“English”, “Portuguese”, “Hello”) would return “Ola”. </p>

<p>Greeting.as </p>

<p>package org.mock4as.samples.greeting {</p>

<p>  public class Greeting {</p>

<p>    private var translator:ITranslator;</p>

<p>    public function Greeting(translator:ITranslator) {
<br/>      this.translator = translator;
<br/>    } 
<br/>        
<br/>    public function sayHello(language:String, name:String):String {
<br/>      return translator.translate(&quot;English&quot;, language, &quot;Hello&quot;) + &quot; &quot; + name;
<br/>    }
<br/>  }
<br/>} ITranslator.as </p>

<p>package org.mock4as.samples.greeting {</p>

<p>  public interface ITranslator {</p>

<p>    function translate(from:String, to:String, word:String):String;</p>

<p>  }
<br/>}At construction time, the Greeting component receives a ITranslator component, a concrete implementation of the ITranslator interface. This simple mechanism is called Constructor Dependency Injection; basically an instance of the dependent component (some ITranslator implementation) is being injected in the Greeting component at construction time. </p>

<p>1. Declare the mockMock4AS offers two mechanisms to implement the mock behavior and verification: subclassing and composition. For clarity sake, the reminder of this page will introduce Mock4AS subclassing based mechanism. </p>

<p>First, subclass org.mock4as.mock and implement the interface of the component you want to mock.   You should have something similar to this:  </p>

<p>class MockTranslator extends Mock implements ITranslator {Next, set up the structure to record calls to the dependant component. For example, if you are making a mock object to replace a component that implements ISomeInterface, and ISomeInterace has a doSomething(stringArg:String):void method in it, your mock should now look something like this:   </p>

<p>    public function translate(from:String, to:String, word:String):String</p>

<p>    {</p>

<p>        record(&quot;translate&quot;, from, to, word);</p>

<p>        return expectedReturnFor(&quot;translate&quot;);</p>

<p>    }The record method call is what is needed to provide the mock implementation of the dependent component.  </p>

<p>MockTranslator code: </p>

<p>import org.mock4as.Mock;</p>

<p>import org.mock4as.samples.greeting.ITranslator;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>class MockTranslator extends Mock implements ITranslator {</p>

<p>    public function translate(from:String, to:String, word:String):String</p>

<p>    {</p>

<p>        record(&quot;translate&quot;, from, to, word);</p>

<p>        return expectedReturnFor(&quot;translate&quot;);</p>

<p>    }</p>

<p>}2. Create a mock objectYou create a mock the exactly same way you create any other object in AS3. </p>

<p>var mock:MockTranslator = new MockTranslator();3. Create expectations for the mockIn order to verify that your mock has been invoked the way you expect, you first need to set up the expectation in the mock. You do this by evoking the mock API. The mock API provides the following methods for setting expectations:  </p>

<p>expects(methodName:String – Tells the mock the name of the expected method call  times(numOfTimes:int) – Sets the number of times a particular method should be called  withArgs(arg1, arg2, …argN) – Tells the mock what arguments should be passed to a particular method  Example:  To tell a mock to expect translate to be called with the arguments &quot;English&quot;,&quot;Portuguese&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, and to return &quot;Ola&quot; you would write:  </p>

<p>mock.expects(&quot;translate&quot;).withArgs(&quot;English&quot;,&quot;Portuguese&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;).willReturn(&quot;Ola&quot;);  </p>

<p>4. Inject the MockThe following code shows mock beinf injected during myGreeting construction time. </p>

<p>var myGreeting:Greeting = new Greeting(mock);At construction time, the Greeting component receives mock, a concrete implementation of the ITranslator interface. The mock object which will record and verify expectations set against itself.  </p>

<p>5. Exercise the mockYou need to exercise the component invoking he mock in order to verify the mock behavior and expectations. In our example, you need to exercise the Greeting component. </p>

<p>assertEquals(&quot;Ola Paulo&quot;, myGreeting.sayHello(&quot;Portuguese&quot;, &quot;Paulo&quot;));6. Verify the the mock expectationsThe last step is to verify the mock expectations. </p>

<p>assertTrue(mock.errorMessage(), mock.success());The success() method checks to see if the methods called match the expectations you have previously set. If mock is invoked the way we expected success() returns true. Otherwise success() will return false.  </p>

<p>The errorMessage() method returns a string that describes the reason why the verification failed. Some possible reasons for failure are:  </p>

<p>Methods were called that were not expected  Methods were not called but they were expected  An expected method was called but it was called with arguments that were not expected  When the assertTrue(mock.errorMessage(), mock.success()) assertion fails, the test runner will output the string returned by mock.errorMessage() aiding in the effort to provide defect localization.  </p>

 summary : <p>Team RetributionTeam Retribution&#39;s project is a single player Ultima inspired top-down RPG where the player controls the hero and embarks on a mighty quest full of danger and intrigue. The story begins in ye old times of yore. A dark mist has crossed the village Soddam. The village people have requested your help to purge the village of an almighty thrusting spearhead of Gaudy Maurauders. </p>

<p>The project is being written using the Java programming language by a team of seven heros. The basics for the game is that there will be a controlable player that will be able to interact with enimies and friendlies within the confinds of the map. There will be a series of linear missions that will involve the user completing a specific task. A final boss will have to be defeated in order to complete the game. </p>

<p>It will have a splash screen intro, a GUI menu with options. The playable game and final outro screen which will credit the heros involved. </p>

<p>We are using googlecode as a place to store progress that we have made in the project. This can be found at code.google.com/p/retribution-rpg This contains a wiki and team information. It gives a general overview of the game aswell as technical information related to the project such as bon files etc.</p>

 summary : <p>The Simple Localization System PHP library allows you to add user-contributed localization to your website or web application. It features an easy to use interface for &quot;in situ&quot; edits of UI strings (a WYSIWYG approach to translating web content or a user interface). </p>

<p>For a live demo, go to http://www.worldwidelexicon.org, pick a language and click on the pencil icon. Any translatable object on the page is highlighted. Click on an object, and you can then translate it to your language. </p>

<p>SLS consists of PHP functions that read/write to text files on your local disk (a type of locale based server side include). We use Javascript to implement highlighting and popup editing. The code for all of these components is available here, and can be modified as needed for your system. </p>

<p>We are planning to add support for PO files in the near future, to allow this tool to be integrated with PO based tools such as Pootle.  </p>

<p>SLS, as its name suggests, is simple. We have not tried to build a complex system. It is a simple utility that you can add to your website or web app. We will be publishing some more detailed tutorials, usage guidelines and other materials in late December. If you have any questions, post a note in the Issues forum.  </p>

 summary : <p>OverviewThe goal of this project is to create an ASP.NET control that simplifies and stream lines the use of the TinyMCE project in an ASP.NET website. This includes the usage of Gzip and 3rd party plugins.  </p>

<p>GoalsEasily switch between gzip and non-gzip Support 3rd party plugins Easily extensible so more specific versions of the control can be built Optimized output of includes AJAX.NET integration Inclusion of the TinyMCE project in the control library as an option for users who don&#39;t want to manage the project within their site.  HelpThis project is more of a hobby than it is a critical project but I do see the need for it in other projects. I know I use TinyMCE all the time in my sites and I&#39;d love to see this take off. Please help out in any way you can since everything will help. </p>

<p>UpdateAs of now the basic structure is available for non Ajax pages. A limited number of options are available but enough to get started. </p>

<p>As this project continues I will add more options through an inheritance model rather than adding all properties directly into the control. This should help with extending the control to more specific cases. Lastly, I believe I have an idea for AJAX.NET integration so that should come next. For this reason I&#39;m branching off a new version of the source. </p>

 summary : <p>AboutTreeDroid aims to be a lightweight, &quot;enhanced&quot; todo-list and mind mapping tool, similar in concept to older tools such as BrainForest and Woody, for the Android platform. </p>

<p>Planned features include: </p>

<p>Unlimited depth nesting of nodes/items A notes/memo field available to every node (to prevent cluttering the main display while still permitting detail when needed) &quot;States&quot; for each node: normal (no special handling), done/not done (simple checkbox), percentage done (5% or 10% increments?) Automatic calculation of done/percent complete when a parent node is given a done or percent state and has children with done or percent states Links to contacts Searchable via system search Import and export via XML </p>

<p>Possible additional features: </p>

<p>Arbitrary attachments per node? Synchronization to/from network service? Cross-platform (Linux/Mac/Win32) desktop version? </p>

<p>StatusThe application is now under active development. No development builds are yet available for download. You will undoubtedly find .apk binaries as I commit code updates to SVN (since Eclipse automatically compiles the project whenever a save is executed and the project is compilable (error-free)), but they will do nothing useful. In fact they&#39;re unsigned for now (so getting them to run on hardware will be a fun exercise :)). Please don&#39;t bother installing them yet. </p>

<p>The current target platform is the Android SDK 1.0R1. The current hardware being used for testing by the developers is the T-Mobile G1. </p>

<p>ContributorsMany thanks to Shannon Biagi for her generous contribution of an icon for TreeDroid.

 summary : <p>SummaryTreeShaker listens to your version control system and alerts your when other developers make commits against your code base. </p>

<p>Want to know more?  Check out the TreeShaker FAQ... </p>

<p>FAQQ: What VCSs does TreeShaker currently support? </p>

<p>A: TreeShaker currently only supports the Subversion VCS.  However, the adapter for Subversion is implemented as a plug-in so supporting additional VCSs would be quite simple.  Create a request in the Issues section if you&#39;d like to see another system supported, or contact me directly if you&#39;d like to know how to add support yourself. </p>

<p>Q: I notice this is open source software yet my company is commercial and therefore driven by greed and self-serving needs.  Can I still use TreeShaker? </p>

<p>A: Yes.  TreeShaker is made available under the New BSD license which is a very permissive open source license.  This means that although TreeShaker is available for free, your free to use it your selfish greedy company. </p>

<p>Q: Haven&#39;t you heard of SVN Notifier? </p>

<p>A: SVN What&#39;s it?  Actually yes I have and I even tried it out.  SVN Notifier is a very cool product and the guys did a great job.  However, it didn&#39;t quite fit my needs because it requires you to have a local working copy of all branches you wish to monitor.  Although this is probably fine 99% of the time, I wanted to be able to monitor any branch in any repository even if I didn&#39;t have it downloaded.  In addition, I wanted a more detailed visual indication of when a branch has changed including who made the change and what the change was. </p>

<p>Q: Well, I like SVN Notifier better. </p>

<p>A: Well, that&#39;s not really a question.  But since both it and TreeShaker are free software, it really doesn&#39;t matter to me which you use.  Here&#39;s the link, have fun.</p>

 title : The gnome-mathusalem Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An Overview </p>

<p>Gnome-Mathusalem would be a bridge between the application who want to execute some kind of job (for example, but not limited to, download, copy, send an email) and the application who can do this job. </p>

<p>With the Application process (AP) i mean the application who want to execute the job, you can suppose that&#39;s  Epiphany. The AP doesn&#39;t interact directly with the interface that expose the service (it can do, but the common behaviur of the applications will not need to do it), so the AP make a request to the Mathusalem process (MP) in CLI (Command Line Interface) form by Mathusalem&#39;s dbus object. The MP dispatches the job&#39;s request to the service, each service is exposed with a dbus object that could be register on the fly or can be defined with a file in a well-know directory. MP chooses the service for each job request, by the parameters of the job, the service that doesn&#39;t expose a set of parameters that isn&#39;t a superset of the job&#39;s parameters are exclused; the job is than assigned to the first service that satisfy the request (to handle 2 or more service candidates is a problem that&#39;s not solved). The MP contacts the Service Process (SP), sending the job parameters that are provided from the application. With these parameters the SP creates a new job process (JP), which would be an effective process on the SO or not. If the creation of the new job process have success than then the dbus_path information is send to the MP which send back to the AP. In the end, if the job process is correctly created the AP will interact only with the JP for the job that have requested. AP could use the standard interface for the JP&#39;s dbus object or can use an specific interface. </p>

<p>Interaction between Application Process and Mathusalem&#39;s Dbus Object In the order to make this communication as simple as possible I used the CLI; every service is defined by two meta-commands, one of this (which i used to refer as commandName) is generic in the meaning that the command explain the action that will do the service, but doesn&#39;t specify which Service is under the hood. One or more Service could have the same commandName, each one can have a proper set of parameters for start the new job. The second meta-command assigned to the service is unique (i&#39;ll refer to it as uniqueCommandName), the application process can know the service behind the Mathusalem Process, and than what the job can do. Let me introducing an example, suppose that Epiphany would download a http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2 and it would use a generic downloader. Epiphany should know that the downloads manager, usually, accept as parameters &quot;url&quot; and &quot;destination&quot;. Epiphany could download the file and discard of this work with: &quot;download --url http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2 --destination /tmp/lastest.tar.bz2&quot; ... or ... Epiphany could download the file, let the user interact with it (for example exposing an gui), and show a list of current downloads using: &quot;download --request-interface org.gnome.mathusalem.user-interact,org.gnome.mathusalem.TimeConsumingJob --url http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2 --destination /tmp/lastest.tar.bz2&quot; </p>

<p>More download manager can expose the &quot;download&quot; commandName, they could accept the same parameters, or not. If the parameters list accepted by the services are different, then only one can be started; but if all the services accept &quot;url&quot; and &quot;destination&quot; as parameters, Mathusalem will choose the service that will do the job (by user settings for example or other method). Suppose, now, that Epiphany expose a self-made download manager and want to use it because &quot;is the best download manager never-made&quot;, if the download manager of epiphany have &quot;download-with-epiphany&quot; as uniqueCommandName, epiphany should use this command: &quot;download-with-epiphany --url http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2 --destination /tmp/lastest.tar.bz2&quot; </p>

<p>In the future, if syntax analyzer will support constructs like IF FOR..., the services like &quot;notify&quot; or &quot;rename&quot; could have some sense: </p>

<p>IF [ download --url http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2 --destination /tmp/lastest.tar.bz2 --output out; ] THEN
<br/>		notify --text &quot;Download of $out[url] is completed&quot; --button1 Open --command1 &quot;open --url $out[destination]&quot; --button2 &quot;Open Folder&quot; --button2 &quot;open-folder --url $out[destination]&quot;;
<br/>	ELSE
<br/>		notify --text &quot;Download of $out[url] is failed\nError: $out[errorMessage]&quot; --button1 Retry --command1 &quot;restart&quot; --button2 &quot;Cancel&quot; --command2 &quot;nop&quot;;
<br/>FIthe previus code is only an idea! With the previus commands epiphany could forget that have started a download for &quot;http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2&quot;, Mathusalem knows what should do if the download fails or if it have success, of course supposing that exist an SP that accepts &quot;notify&quot; as meta-command and that accepts these parameters. </p>

<p>Introducing Mathusalem Interfaces Every job have at least one interface exposed by DBus, this interface allows applications to comunicate with the job. If the job exposes an interface that the application knows, then the interaction between application and job process could be very simple and intuitive. On the previus example, I supposed that &quot;epiphany&quot; need to download &quot;http://www.kernel.org/lastest.tar.bz2&quot;; as user, I expect to see a window where i can control the download process, and where I can interact with it. Suppose that Epiphany knows this interface: </p>

<p>/*this interface is only an example*/
<br/>public interface DownloadJobIface: GLib.Object {
<br/>		public abstract bool				supportMultipleDownload();
<br/>		public abstract void			  addSource(string s);
<br/>	  public abstract string[]		listOfSources();
<br/>		public abstract	void				removeSource(string s);</p>

<p>	  public abstract int					getProgress();
<br/>	  public abstract int					getTimeRemain();
<br/>}Epiphany, with these information, could to show an appropriate graphic interface with which the user can interact; the graphic interface could to interact directly with the job process using the DownloadJobIface interface. </p>

<p>Another intersting aspect of the interfaces is the ability to collect similar jobs. Supposing that Epiphany would display ALL the download jobs actually on the system, one way to do it could be let the service process to comunicate with epiphany process with a direct-line ... obviously this way could work only if the service process and epiphany process knows exactly who they are and what&#39;s the protocol used to comunicate.  Instead Mathusalem exposes an object like the java.listener, the listener are created using the name of the interfaces that each job exposes. The listener could be requested to Mathusalem Process which will look for all the job that implements the interface specified, which will advise the application process when a job with the requested interface is started or is terminated or is crashed. In this way Epiphany could know all the download processes, even the download processes started with some other &quot;download services&quot;, using the JobIface could know which of these are started with the own download service and which with other download services. </p>

<p>The Interface&#39;s listener could be used in more other contexts: nautilus could monitor all the processes that write on the disk showing a progressBar near the icon of the file that is the subject of the writing, pidgin could monitor all the file sended with msn protocol ... doesn&#39;t matter who have started the requested (could be pidgin itself, or nautilus, or evolution, or </p>

<p>), and finally the listiner could be used to monitor the &quot;Time consuming&quot; jobs, if all the jobs that require lot of time to be completed expose the interface: </p>

<p>/*the proposed interface for the time consuming jobs*/
<br/>public interface TimeConsumingJobIface: GLib.Object {
<br/>		public abstract bool		getCapability(uint32 action);
<br/>/* or this?
<br/>		public abstract bool 		canBePaused();
<br/>		public abstract bool 		canBeStopped();
<br/>*/</p>

<p>		public abstract uint32		getStatus();
<br/>/* or this?
<br/>		public abstract bool 		isPaused();
<br/>		public abstract bool 		isStopped();
<br/>*/</p>

<p>		public abstract bool		start();
<br/>		public abstract bool		pause();
<br/>		public abstract bool		stop();</p>

<p>		public signal void			onProgressChanged();</p>

<p>		public signal void			onStatusChanged();</p>

<p>		public abstract double		getProgress();
<br/>	
<br/>		public abstract uint64		getEstimatedTimeRemain();
<br/>}the example-application that i wrote show all these jobs (the time consuming jobs) in a single window. </p>

<p>TODO&#39;s - Define a policy for choose which is the best service that satisfy a command line where 2 or more services have the requested parameters. - Auto register and unregister for service process: some service process could be described in a well-knowed directory, if the application that expose the service process is crashed, Mathusalem process should stop to receive every request for this service - Ehnanche the CLI, with the support of construct like IF;FOR defining a way that allow the job process to say which is the output values </p>

<p>How To Try do the svn checkout cd gnome-mathusalem ./autogen make cd job-monitor ./autogen make cd ../download-service ./compile </p>

<p>Now you have the complete environment (i hope :)). If you want try Mathusalem (and probabily you want that if your are reading this :D ), you must follow these instructions in this order: cd ../gnome-mathusalem ./Mathusalem &amp; download-service/gwget-service &amp; job-monitor/job-monitor &amp; </p>

<p>now, using the dbus-bin-tools: dbus-send --session --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Mathusalem /org/gnome/Mathusalem/Services org.gnome.Mathusalem.ServiceManager.startJob string:&quot;download --url http://127.0.0.1/data --filename /tmp/foobar&quot; </p>

 summary : <p>With the ever increasing number of digital photos in our personal photo album, we find it hard to organize those photographs so that they are easily accessible when required. Adding tags is a good approach to categorize photographs. However, it requires manually identifying appropriate tag for each photograph. We present a novel idea of automatically identifying the person in an image and hence adding appropriate tags to the photograph. This makes the process of searching for required photographs much easier. </p>

<p>Center for High Performance Computing </p>

<p>University of Utah (2005) </p>

<p>DescriptionBioseqlib is small library in C++ for bioinformatics applications developted at Center for High Performance Computing University of Utah. Originally, it was built as a part of a bigger project providing basics algorithms like memory management, sequence manipulation and dynamic programming. Since then, the library has grown little more including binary tree operations and some algorithms for calculating phylogenetic trees. I/O functions are done by seqio library, a C library designed to read biological sequences from different databases. A series of wrapper functions are used to access seqio capabilities from bioseqlib. </p>

<p>The structure of this library will allow to be a natural container for more complex implementations. It is organized to improve code portability and re-usability. Another feature is that it is well documented using doxygen as documentation generator. </p>

<p>Bioseqlib featuresBasic containers to represent biological sequences and any of their possible alignments Amino acid alphabet including the PAM and BLOSUM score matrices. A general binary tree definition and operation. Algorithms to create a rooted or unrooted trees given the distances between vertices. C++ adaptation of seqio library. Algorithms to calculate the sequence metrics and/or distances. Linear and quadratic space algorithms for optimal global alignment between two sequences using affinitive gaps. InstallationIt is necessary to define BIOSEQLIBROOT that should be ponting to the root directory where the library is install. </p>

<p>After that just type &#39;make&#39; in the BIOSEQLIBROOT directory. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>~&gt; mkdir bioseqlib
<br/>~&gt; cp bioseqlib-x.x.tar.gz bioseqlib/
<br/>~&gt; cd bioseqlib
<br/>bioseqlib&gt; export BIOSEQLIBROOT=$PWD (for bash)</p>
 title : The cacheer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the cache module for the Pivot Search Engine. It was designed to cache hostname, robots.txt and web query. The replacement algorithms is not the best way but it is easy to use.I will continue to improve this cache module which could be used in most of the purpose and the bigger data sets.   </p>

<p>The implementation of replacemnent algorithm is like History Least Recently Used(HLRU) which is the hash structure and the hash algorithm is FNV hash. </p>

<p>You could see the &quot;README&quot; file before using this cacheer. The documentation of cache module was builed by perldoc and type this command &quot;perldoc design.txt&quot; to see all detail of this library in unix-like os. </p>

<p>This module has been tested with i386 Debian and i386 2.6.20-Gentoo. It is for 32bit platform. If you want 64bit version, you could contact to me via jiayunye@gmail.com.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>ApplicationsThe problem of finding convex hulls finds its practical applications in pattern recognition, image processing, statistics and GIS. It also serves as a tool, a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms.  For example, consider the problem of finding the diameter of a set of points, which is the pair of points a maximum distance apart. The diameter will always be the distance between two points on the convex hull. The &#39;&#39;O&#39;&#39;(&#39;&#39;n&#39;&#39; log &#39;&#39;n&#39;&#39;) algorithm for computing diameter proceeds by first constructing the convex hull, then for each hull vertex finding which other hull vertex is farthest away from it. This so-called &quot;rotating-calipers&quot; method can be used to move efficiently from one hull vertex to another.</p>

 title : The elixis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Elixis is an encryption library made in C#. You can encrypt and decrypt data using AES,TripleDES and MD5 algorithms so far, other algorithms may be imported in future. </p>

<p>AES (Rijndael) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially announced that Rijndael, 
<br/>designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, would be the new Advanced Encryption Standard. 
<br/>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the current encryption standard, 
<br/>intended to be used by  the U.S. Government organisations to protect sensitive 
<br/>(and even secret and top secret) information. It is also becoming a global standard 
<br/>for commercial software and hardware that use encryption. It is a block cipher which 
<br/>uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit keys. Rijndael is very secure and has no known weaknesses.  
<br/>TripleDES Triple DES is three times slower than regular DES but can be billions of 
<br/>times more secure if used properly. Triple DES is simply another mode of DES operation. 
<br/>It takes three 64-bit keys, for an overall key length of 192 bits. 
<br/>The procedure for encryption is exactly the same as regular DES, but it is 
<br/>repeated three times, hence the name Triple DES. The data is encrypted with 
<br/>the first key, encrypted with the second key, and finally encrypted again 
<br/>with the third key. Triple DES enjoys much wider use than DES because DES 
<br/>is so easy to break with today&#39;s rapidly advancing technology. 
<br/>MD5 In cryptography, MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used,partially  insecure cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. 
<br/>As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and       
<br/>is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. An MD5 hash is typically expressed as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. 
<br/>MD5 was designed by Ron Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4. In 1996, a flaw was found with the design of MD5.

Ideally, this could allow motion algorithms to be developed that are better than anything a human could create.</p>
 summary : <p>This is an implementation of exact geodesic algorithm for triangular mesh (first described by Mitchell, Mount and Papadimitriou in 1987) with some minor improvements, extensions and simplifications. The algorithm has O(n^2 log n) worst-case time complexity, but in practice can work with million-node meshes in reasonable time. For the quick overview, see J. O&#39;Rourke, &quot;Computational Geometry Column 35&quot;, SIGACT News, 30(2) Issue #111.</p>
 title : The geodesic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>geomlib is a collection of classes for 3D vector math, 3D model loading and manipulation, raytracing, and advanced geometric algorithms. </p>

<p>It provides classes for several geometric primitives, such as vectors (2D/3D/4D), rays, triangles, triangle meshes, parallelograms, spheres, tori, cones (open and closed), rings,  bezier patches, bounding boxes, and bounding spheres. It has classes for Quaternion and Matrix calculations. </p>

<p>It specifies an API for 3D camera models and provides several implementations: freelook, targeted, and snapshot cameras. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it contains classes to read the obj model text file format (for basic models). </p>

<p>Most of the geometric primitive classes support standard raytracing operations as well as freely programmable shading and texturing. Support classes for these operations are also included, such as texture coordinate calculation, point and area light sources, perlin noise, and a standard library for programmable shading. </p>

<p>Last but not least, it contains implementations for a number of algorithms: numerical root finding up to degree 4, simple and contour based polygon triangulation, 2D convex hull, 3D polygon clipping, smooth vertex normal calculation for triangle meshes, a red-black treeset, and quick-select. </p>

<p>All of that comes in a library package with no external dependencies (except JUnit for the unit tests, which can be omitted).</p>

 title : The grapy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is grapyGrapy is a library for representing graphs and manipulating them, including implementation of some graph algorithms. </p>

<p>What&#39;s its aim?Grapy aims to be usable in implementing various algorithms. It especially wants to be usable where e.g. you have to use a specially behaving DFS (depth-first search) or BFS (breadth-first search) - e.g. topological sort, Dinic maxflow algorithm etc. Therefore it has to be flexible. It has a plugin-based DFS (depth-first search) hook model, where you add custom actions at various points of DFS; e.g. topological sort is implemented by a simple hookset. Dinic maxflow algorithm is planned to be implemented with 2 DFS and 1 BFS custom hook sets as well. Visualisation of DFS running can be implemented with a visualisation DFS hook set as well. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the state of the project?See QuickStart. Grapy is very young, but can already do DFS quite well - topological sorting and strongly connected components work; and a script is included that prints a representation of a DFS run for any graph you supply to it in a text file, and optionally can perform a topological sort, or print strongly connected components. Other things planned to be included in future are in ToDo.</p>

 title : The gsgep Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GSGEPWelcomeGene selection algorithms from microarray data set have been the subject of considerable research in the past few years, and investigators have been continuously improving the performance of the algorithms. However, the results are still far from satisfactory. To face this challenge, we proposed a two-step methodology of gene selection and multi-cancer classification based on step-by-step improvement of classification performance ( GSGEP). The first step of gene selection was to use an existing data mining feature selection algorithm to do the initial selection, resulting in a gene subset; and the second step was to select the genes from this subset based on the gradual improvement in the performance of the classification. </p>

<p>Current StatusVersion 0.1.1 of GSGEP is stable and is recommended for all users.  </p>

 title : The jalds Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JALDS ( J ava AL gorthms and D ata S tructures) pronounced JAL-DOES is an open source repository that contains a variety of algorithms and data structures that you can use in your own code, including graphs , trees , sorting- algorithms and much more. </p>

<p>Motivation : Have you ever wondered, &quot;What is the best sorting algorithm I should use with this data?&quot; , Well the only person who can answer that question is .... YOU. You know your data better than anyone else! And this project can help you experiment and choose the best one. </p>

<p>Graphs, graphs are everywhere eg: Social Networks, Web Pages ... JALDS contains graph algorithms and data structures that you can reuse in your own projects. </p>

<p>Should you use a Binary Tree for sorting ever thing ? not necessarily a regular binary tree will be fast only if you insert elements in a random order, can you guarantee that you will be inserting elements in random order ? Your other option is to use a RedBlack tree, that will guarantee that the tree is balanced but you pay an overhead for that. </p>

<p>Bubble Sort is the worst sort but easiest to implement, did you know there is a Comb Sort that is a very slight variation of Bubble Sort (hence easy to implement) but rivals complex sorts such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort in speed ?  Some of these Sorting algorithms are Stable (keeps the original order of keys, if two key have the same value), online  (all keys need not be provided at the beginning) and off-line. </p>

<p>If you wanted to compare a variety of algorithms and pick the best one, (and not just rely on the stuff that comes in the JDK) then this project is for you.  Having many options is a good thing.  </p>

<p>This project aims to put all of these algorithms and its implementations in one easy spot for everyone to access, read and re-use.  </p>

 title : The js-algorithm-benchmarker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GeneralThis javascript library provides graphical report on an algorithm&#39;s running time. </p>

<p>The key idea behind this project is to ease the testing of an algorithm&#39;s running time. With javascript, it is easy for a developer to quickly test the performance of an algorithm with a specified input, and find out how the performance is affected by the input&#39;s size. The developer does not have to generate boilerplate code to graph out the algorithm&#39;s running times on varied inputs. </p>

<p>Thus, this project aims to provide a platform for students of algorithms. </p>

<p>HowtoCheckout the project, and open the benchmarker.html on your browser. The rest is self-explanatory. </p>

<p>Example outputsThe graph below displays Array.sort() running times with 3 data sets. Each data set in the benchmark contained random numbers. The first data set had 2000 random numbers, the second 3000 and the third 4000. The library performed the sorting operation five times on each data set, and then requested a google chart image on the median running time of each operation.</p>

 title : The libpgrl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>LibPGThe PG library was intended to be a high-performance policy-gradient reinforcement learning library. Since the first version it has been extended to a number of value based RL algorithms, so the name is only historical. It is now a general RL library which implements, for example, natural actor critic, and least squares policy iteration.  It has been designed with large distributed RL systems in mind. It&#39;s not perfect, but it is pretty fast. API documentation and examples are provided. </p>

<p>What libpg does NOT provide is model based planning algorithms such as value iteration, or real-time dynamic programming, or exact policy gradient. There is limited support for belief state tracking in the simulators/Cassandra/ directory (named because we use the POMDP file format created by Anthony Cassandra).  One day I&#39;d like to extend it to these situations, but that will require some uptake of the library. </p>

<p>Project goalsProvide easy to use implementations of state-of-the-art RL algorithms for the non RL savvy, allowing immediate application to difficult industry 
<br/>problems.

 title : The libsanax Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Libsanax is a generic library, written in C, that implements the most known and used data structures in programming, sorting algorithms and a tiny garbage collector. The purpose is to stop reinventing the wheel when doing homework at faculty, limited by the ANSI standard. Because the library is platform independent, it&#39;s not thread-safe; but you can make your own thread-safe wrapper functions. The garbage collector is a wrapper over the allocation functions and it isn&#39;t automatically called by the library. </p>

<p>The data structures organization is inspired from the Java data structures implementation and the STL(C++ Standard Template Library). It also uses some design patterns like Abstract Factory, Decorator and Singleton, to make implementation easier to understand and develop; although it&#39;s not as clear as in programming languages with classes. The library contains the following data structures :  AVL tree  Binary search tree  Binary tree  Complex number  Doubly linked list  Hash set  Hash table  Heap - binary min-heap  Linked list  Matrix  Pair  Queue  Set  Skip-list  Stack  String  Tree - multipath tree  Vector     Graph - using adjacency matrix representation. </p>

<p>Also, it implements the following sorting algorithms :  Generic sorting algorithms : bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, selection sort, heap sort, gnome sort, cocktail sort.  Numeric sorting algorithms : radix sort, number sort. </p>

<p>I&#39;m working on adding :  Red-black tree  Treap  Trie  Splay  Scapegoat tree  B-Tree  Interval tree </p>

<p>In the future i may add :  Fibonacci heap.  Other exotic data structures.  Parallel and thread-safe implementation for all data structures. </p>

 title : The lovoalign Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>lovoalignLovoalign is a new structural alignment package. The methods used for structural alignment are based on Low Order Value Optimization (LOVO) theory. The use of LOVO theory led to the development of fast convergent algorithms that provide very robust optimization of scoring functions. </p>

<p>Numerical experiments show that the LOVO algorithms implemented here provide the most reliable optimization of the STRUCTAL alignment while being very fast. </p>

<p>Simple input parameters can be used to align two structures, a single structure to a whole database, or to perform an all-on-all database structural alignment.  </p>

<p>See http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~martinez/lovoalign </p>

<p>The present site is contains current and previous versions of the package. </p>

<p>The alignment can be highly customized, since any subatom selection of the structures, main chains or not, can be aligned by using the &quot;-beta and -ocup&quot; input options. </p>

<p>How to install and useCurrently the package is mostly developed for linux/unix users. Under those systems, instalation is done by: </p>

<p>1 - Download the lovoalign.DATE.tar.gz file. </p>

<p>2 - Unpack it and compile it:  </p>

<p>    tar -xzvf lovoalign.DATE.tar.gz
<br/>    cd lovoalign
<br/>    ./configure
<br/>    make(You must have some fortran compiler installed) </p>

<p>The directory lovoalign/input contains an example input file for the &quot;lovoalign.sh&quot; script, which is mostly self-explicative, but required the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) package. With this input file, run lovoalign.sh with: </p>

<p> lovoalign.sh lovoalign.inp  </p>

<p>Otherwise, the &quot;lovoalign&quot; executable can be run as a standalone program, as indicated by the instructions in the lovoalign main site. </p>

 title : The othello-evolution Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a sandbox for experimenting with genetic algorithms. The genetic factors are the weights associated with various strategies in Othello. The fitness of each individual is measured by playing a game against other individuals in the generation. Individuals are selected based on fitness for breeding the next generation. Breeding can introduce a small amount of mutation. </p>

<p>The object model and program structure is designed to be simple and easily extensible. This enables the casual programmer to experiment with different Othello strategies, selection and mutation algorithms, etc. </p>

<p>For example, Othello strategies are implemented using the following interface, which allows the strategy to tell the system which plays it prefers: </p>

<p>boolean ratePlay(Color color, int col, int row, Board board); </p>

<p>Here is the graph from a sample run: </p>

 title : The phylosoc2007khartmann Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Conservation managers are faced with the problem of having many species that are in need of conservation but limited funds to allocate to them. This raises the question of which species should be protected. One framework for prioritising species for conservation is the Noah&#39;s Ark Problem (NAP). The NAP combines a phylogenetic tree for the species of interest with species specific survival probabilities and conservation costs. The aim of the NAP is to allocate conservation expenditure such that future expected biodiversity is maximised. This results in a computational difficult problem -- the general problem may be NP hard -- however several algorithms have been developed by myself and others to solve variations of the NAP with particular parameter restrictions.   </p>

<p>At present no package is available that implements the various algorithms for solving the NAP. The only implementations that exist have been written for individual algorithms by a range of researchers in a range of languages. This severely restricts the application of these results to real conservation problems -- particularly as those people interested in applying these methods (eg. conservation managers) often have little mathematical or programming background. 
<br/>  This project will implement the various algorithms for solving the Noah&#39;s Ark Problem, thereby encouraging future results to become available in the same package. A GUI will be built on top of this implementation that enables non-programmers to apply these methods and compare species prioritisations with those produced by related simple indices. This will create a common package where researchers can implement algorithms and end users can apply these results to their problems. 
<br/>  BioPerl forms a good basis for this project as many related species specific indices are already implemented in Bio::Phylo. This project will produce species prioritisations from Bio::Tree::TreeI compatible objects and conservation information (eg. survival probabilities) using algorithms developed for solving the Noah&#39;s Ark Problem. The GUI will be cross platform deployable and easy to install. Good documentation will be produced that thoroughly describes the implemented algorithms and indices.</p>
 title : The planarity Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This code project will provide a collection of graph algorithms implemented with the framework developed for implementing the Edge Addition Planar Graph Embedding and Obstruction Isolation algorithms. The  version 1.0 reference implementation that accompanied the journal article is compatible with the code in this project.  </p>

<p>There has been successful technology transfer of this planarity algorithm into other projects, including Boost, LinKnot,  Magma, and Sage.   </p>

<p>The software in this code project provides a graph algorithm framework and library, including an updated version of the edge addition combinatorial planar graph embedder and planar obstruction isolator (i.e., a Kuratowski subgraph isolator).  This code project also includes several extensions that implement planarity-related algorithms such as a planar graph drawing algorithm, an outerplanar graph embedder and outerplanar obstruction isolator, and a number of subgraph homeomorphism search algorithms. </p>

<p>Over time, the library will grow to contain more planarity-related extension algorithms as well as some graph algorithms that are not strictly related to planarity. This will increase the utility of the software and also provide the possibility of comparing generalized graph algorithms to those which may be tailored to work on planar graphs.</p>
 summary : <p>MATLAB Pointer Library provides an implemetation of pointers and data structures in MATLAB </p>

<p>The idea of the library is taken from DSATX - The Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Toolbox (Yaron Keren). Unfortunately, DSTAX supplies certain mex-functions as dll-files and does not contain the source C code. The mentioned dll-files are supplied only for early versions of MATLAB (not for MATLAB 7.0). We implement pointer objects that support all possibilities of DSTAX pointers and some other possibilities. Almost all functions are written in C. Source code is included. On the other hand, DSATX also supplies a lot of m-files that implement some algorithms on data structures (lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, avl, and red-black trees) whith using DSATX pointers. You can use these m-files jointly with our implementaions of pointers.  </p>

<p>You can review and rate this library on Matlab Central. Thanks!  </p>

Much (highly-regulated) assembly language and some C is used here to increase the performance and decrease bloat potential, (because to code this in assembly, it&#39;s ESSENTIAL to have excellent, lean code design). </p>

<p>Development of PwnOS will be switching to be done with PwnIDE once PwnIDE reaches version 0.2.4.  Development so far has been done with RadASM and MASM32 for assembly, and Dev-C++ and MinGW for C/C++.  Documentation is produced with Natural Docs.  Custom linking is done with a utility called JLOC, and drive image writing is done with various utilities. </p>

 title : The pyramid-point-renderer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Image-space reconstruction of continuous surfaces from scattered one-pixel projections of points is known to potentially offer an advantageous time complexity compared to surface splatting techniques. We propose a new algorithm for hardware-accelerated image-space reconstruction using pull-push interpolation and present an efficient GPU implementation. Compared to published image-space reconstruction approaches employing the pull-push interpolation, our method offers a significantly improved image quality because of the integration of elliptic box-filters and support for deferred Phong shading. For large point-based models, our GPU implementation is capable of rendering more than 100M points per second -- including image-space reconstruction and deferred shading. </p>

<p>This project includes codes for the main algorithm from three already published articles. I&#39;ve been busy making the code a little more usable, and with the inclusion of the VCG library things are much simpler now. The current version has still some improvements to make but is generally usable. Mind you there are still lots of files from older version laying around, these will be removed in the first release coming soon, but they should not do any harm for now. </p>

<p>The Wiki is still under construction, but is being gradually updated. Remember to check specially the compiling page and the models to see what kind of files can be used. </p>

<p>This point-based renderer will soon be integrated within Meshlab. </p>

 title : The pyrl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning (or artificial intelligence) approach to optimisation. Well suited for Markov decision processes (MDP), RL uses experience with a model (or real) system to update estimates of optimal state-specific decisions. This is more appropriate for large-dimension problems for which the calculation of optimal policies, via dynamic programming or related methods, is unfeasible.  </p>

<p>PyRL implements a number of popular RL algorithms in Python. This allows end users to focus on the specifics of the optimisation problem, rather than on the mechanics of machine learning.</p>

<br/>This project contains recursive algorithms which demonstrate the simplicity and the power potential of recursion and an algorithm visualizer. This visualizer application has an algorithm interface, new algorithms can be plugged into it, and it provides an interface to visualize and parametrize the algorithms. </p>

<p>What is recursion?Who wouldn&#39;t have seen the simple recursive factorial algorithm? </p>

<p>int fact( int n ) {
<br/>    if ( n &lt; 2 )
<br/>        return 1;
<br/>    else
<br/>        return n * fact( n - 1 );
<br/>}I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need to explain recursion in a new way, you can find numerous explanation for that (wikipedia or just google it). </p>

<p>Recursion is often said to be slow and ineffective, which is true. But those are not the only aspects of writing programs and developing softwares. </p>

<p>There are many cases where the recursive solution is way more simple and clearer, and it takes much less time and effort to develop it, maintain it and understand it. This project is here to give you examples how simple, clear and understandable it can be. </p>

<p>The best advice you can give and take: </p>

<p> Don&#39;t be afraid of using recursion, but use it wisely! 
<br/>The basics of recursionThe 2 main things you have to know about recursive algorithms are: </p>

<p>They (the functions/methods) call themselves before they would return, before they would actually finish their job (maybe not themselves directly, but a function/method that called them before, and not yet returned). There has to be some kind of condition (so called termination condition) in the recursive calls in order so they will stop sometime and return eventually. </p>

<p>How can we recognize the situations and possibilities to use recursion?Self similarity. If we can identify self similarity in the problem, it&#39;s almost sure we can use recursion to solve it. If we can break down the original task into smaller pieces which are similar to the bigger problem in a way that the solution of the bigger problem can be assembled from the solutions of the smaller ones, we&#39;re almost winners. The recursive algorithm&#39;s job is to define how to assemble the whole solution from the smaller ones. </p>

<p>For example in the factorial algorithm, we break down of calculating n! into calculating (n-1)!, and then we get the solution of n! by multiplying (n-1)! by n. Note that the recursive factorial algorithm stands here only by a demostration as the iterative solution for calculating the factorial is much more effective. </p>

<p>So when should we use recursion?Whenever we identify self similarity, we should not always turn to recursion automatically. Profit becomes noticeably bigger when the small pieces are not independent, when the solution of a small piece depends on or requires the solution(s) of another piece(s) (usually the neighbors&#39;). </p>

<p>For example if we want to generate a terrain, we&#39;re more than welcome to use recursion. Because if we look at a slice of the terrain, what does it look like? Yes, like a terrain. Like the whole. So we can use recursion here, but for the whole terrain to be smooth, we want the slices to connect to each other without break lines, without edges, so in order to generate a slice of a terrain we need to know what its neighbors look like, we need the generated data (the terrain heights for example) on the borders of the slices at least (or the derivate of the surface on the borders for smoother terrain generation).</p>
 title : The reflexivelos Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a roguelike engine I&#39;ve been developing in my spare time. I&#39;m putting it online so I don&#39;t lose it when my computer explodes, but please, reuse the code. I&#39;m also putting some of the ideas in the wiki - however, you can probably find better versions of these articles on roguebasin (look for &quot;digital field of view&quot;). </p>

<p>The selling point is an O(N2) symmetric field of view algorithm based on &quot;digital lines&quot;. The neat thing is that the maps displayed don&#39;t even need to be grids, but can instead be weird manifold-y things. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also currently working on random manifold generation, but that part of the code needs a little debugging (it works, but I don&#39;t know that). </p>

<p>To do list: </p>

<p>speed up best case run-time of field of view algorithm. understand random generation of manifolds. randomly generate manifolds as you explore them. make this into an actual roguelike. write up proof that maximum number of visible obstructions is O(N3/2). randomly generate covers of given manifolds. </p>

<p>Resim (Research on Image) is a platform independent GUI application that provides basic image processing algorithms and filters. A processor is any processing unit composed of inputs, outputs, parameters and a processing unit. Each processor has a corresponding GUI component placed on a palette. There is a working area where palette components can be dragged-dropped and connected between themselves. Each processor has a corresponding property editor where specific parameters can be adjusted. There are three basic type of palette elements which are input, processing and view components. Input components read image files, processing components process data (edge detectors, threshold etc.) and view components display processed data. Whole chain(s) can be run after components are connected in the working area.</p>

Please don&#39;t even bother downloading it yet, otherwise you&#39;ll just experience great frustration. Wait until this message is removed and some of the bigger bugs are corrected. </p>

<p>Just FYI, as of 9/4/2008 progress is being made.  The SQLManager is now handling the creation of the internal db.  Next up, work will proceed in  populating it with market data. </p>

<p>ScopeSharp AI is a library of tools written in c# which help you pick stocks.  The libraries use AI to search through stock market data and find patterns, trends and relationships.  This helps reduce the ground work required to find good stock picks. This tool also strives for transparency meaning that whatever patterns it finds will be shown to the user in a way that&#39;s easily understandable. This tool can be be used to search for and analyze stock data with the goal of identifying good leading indicators and algorithms for timing stock trades on the open market.  We will be utilizing data from eodata.com.  Instead of just plugging every known variable into a nueral network, this project will use machine learning to search for and find good leading indicators out of the hundreds of potential ones that could be used.  This will be done on daily detail and should be able to find good leading indicators where they exist.  Error and complexity scoring will be implemented to allow easy comparision between indicators and alogorithms and back testing will be implemented to allow testing indicators and algorithms against real world data. </p>

<p>ArchitectureThe UI of Sharp AI utilizes the Microsoft CAB libraries.  This provides many benefits that reduce the amount of code that must be written and gives uniformity to the architecture.  See the code plex project for more details.  http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient.  All the required dlls for the CAB will be packaged in the compiled bits when they are released. </p>

<p>The AI framework is a mixture of custom implementations of algorithms from AIMA (Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach)  this is the text book for modern AI, and a nueral network framework called FANN (http://leenissen.dk/fann/). </p>

<p>Data will be stored and processed using SQLExpress as an embedded application database. This means you must have SQL Express installed to run this application. If you don&#39;t already have it, download it from here.. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=220549b5-0b07-4448-8848-dcc397514b41&amp;DisplayLang=en</p>
 title : The sharpdetection Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The SharpDetection project is an implementation of simple motion detection algorithms applied to video from a locally attached web camera.  The project utilizes some advanced features of the C# language to achieve simple image analysis, which is extended to motion detection algorithms, without overwhelming computer resources, such as the memory and processor. </p>

<p>The provided algorithms are fairly straight-forward and allow other developers to learn how to implement simple image analysis, which can be applied to static images or video. </p>

<p>Overall, the project demonstrates the following: </p>

<p>How to connect to a web camera with the AVICAP32 DLL How to receive single frame images from a web camera How to analyze images from a web camera How to apply motion detection analysis on images And since the project does not utilize any third party libraries, other developers will benefit from learning how to implement simple image analysis and motion detection algorithms. </p>

 title : The skidmore-vega Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>VEGAVEGA is both a program for visualizing algorithms, as well as a library of Graph classes that can aid the programmer in the development of their own algorithms.  </p>

<p>LibraryThe VEGA library is currently under development, but so far has a large set of base classes to work with.  The code utilizes the Java Generics framework which allows for compile-time type checking, so as to prevent class cast errors.  This is not a requirement for the developer, but is highly recommended. </p>

<p>The code consists of a series of base classes that can be used to construct more complicated structures.  All forms of Graphs, whether they be Trees or Networks, extend the base Abstract Graph class, which utilizes the Graph interface also included in the code.   </p>

<p>It should be noted that almost every class included in VEGA has a corresponding interface that allows for custom development of classes to meet specific requirements and expectations. </p>

<p>VEGA ApplicationThe VEGA Application is a tool that is meant to help users see how an algorithm or data-structure works by visually representing it using Graphviz.  The reasoning behind the development of the application is that it is far easier to understand how something works when one moves beyond abstract mathematical notation and is able to see working demos. </p>

<p>VEGA has been developed such that it is not able to just represent a handful of algorithms and data-structures, but rather any algorithm or data-structure that adheres to some basic conventions.  By implementing some basic methods, a user is able to take existing code of an algorithm or data-structure and output the necessary information to VEGA for representation.  </p>

<p>Current Algorithms and Data StructuresWe currently have implemented a handful of algorithms and data structures, and more are on the way.  As of July 10, 2008, we have the following: </p>

<p>Fibonacci Heaps Red Black Trees Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm 2-OPT (TSP Algorithm) Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Heap sort Binary Search Tree Prim&#39;s Algorithm </p>

 title : The sls-ptsp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This software package provides implementations of random restart local search, iterated local search, genetic  algorithm to tackle the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP).   </p>

<p>The PTSP is a paradigmatic example of a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. TSP-specific random restart local search, iterated local search, genetic algorithm are customized to solve the PTSP. This customization consists of using the estimation approach to evaluate the solutions costs and integrating the recently developed estimation-based local search into the metaheuristics.  </p>

<p>Important remarks1: Iterated local search and genetic algorithm are currently the state-of-the-art algorithms for the PTSP. </p>

 title : The string-sorting Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A collection of string sorting algorithm implementationsThis collection features several string sorting algorithm implementations, that have been tuned to take better advantage of modern hardware. Classic implementations tend to optimize instruction counts, but when sorting large collections of strings, we also need to focus on memory issues. All algorithms are implemented using C and C++, and are released under the MIT license. </p>

<p>Technical details: </p>

<p>All of the implementations sort the strings by raw byte values. This means that they are mainly intended for research use. Includes several variants of known and efficient (string) sorting algorithms, such as MSD radix sort, burstsort and multi-key-quicksort. Emphasis on reducing cache misses and memory stalls. Includes the tools to create an extensive HTML based report, that can be used to compare the different implementations. The report includes technical details, such as TLB, L1 and L2 cache misses, run times and memory peak usage. Supports Linux huge pages. For more information, see below. </p>

<p>RequirementsLinux Boost CMake Requirements to create the HTML based reportOProfile for most measurements, probably also requires root privileges. The default settings use Intel Core 2 specific events. When profiling on other platforms, you will most likely need to modify the scripts in the report/ directory. /usr/bin/memusage for measuring the memory peak usage. This is a GNU libc utility.

<br/>    $ ./sortstringHuge pagesThe default page size on x86 processors is quite small, something like four kilobytes. When working with large data sets, this means that the input is spread to thousands of memory pages. Unfortunately random access in thousands of pages can be slow (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer). Using a larger page size can alleviate the problem. If the page size is in the order of megabytes or even gigabytes, most data sets can fit into a much smaller amount of memory pages. </p>

<p>In this program, huge pages can be enabled using the --hugetlb-text and --hugetlb-ptrs options. The former option places the input data (i.e. the actual strings from the given file) into huge pages, and the latter option places the string pointer array into huge pages. Using huge pages in Linux requires a recent kernel version, CPU support, and properly adjusted kernel settings. </p>

<p>libhugetlbfs (http://libhugetlbfs.ozlabs.org/) can be used to replace all calls to malloc to use huge pages.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutReference: http://www.cs.uic.edu/~i523/ </p>

<p>In the diverse modern society, people are divided with languages. Kids at school unconsciously divide themselves into linguistic groups. Kids who speak Spanish at home are comfortable to talk to and mingle with kids from a similar background, similar things happen with kids speaking English, Chinese or Italian. This language barrier divides them and makes it difficult for them to be involved in an activity that needs the skills of all the groups of children. Hence it makes it necessary to teach children an easy and interesting way of understanding how languages work. National Standards for Foreign Language Education also states that, “The United States must educate students who are linguistically and culturally equipped to communicate successfully in a pluralistic American society and abroad” 9 This project makes use of tangibles in the form of modified Lego bricks to teach kids the importance of structure in languages. Each Lego brick represents a particular part of a sentence, like you could have blocks that represent a Subject, Verb, Object, Articles etc. The Lego bricks are attached with simple ID tags called iButtons, which is read by a reader called the 1-wire. A PC running custom built software helps design a variety of activities to be carried out to aid in learning linguistics concepts.   The goal of the project is to provide an interesting yet cost effective method to teach basic concepts of language structures and semantics.  Activities designed using the system could also improve logical reasoning and creative thinking. </p>

 title : The audio-music-player Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Playing sounds like Midi, mp3 and Real Media requires plugins in all browsers. Flash players play some media files. This project experiments with ways to play sound in web pages which can work in all the browsers. </p>

<p>The Audio player Gadget uses the embed tag and works with browsers using the plugins with the supporting multimedia players like Quicktime and Real Player. </p>

<p>This Gadget code is also an example of changing skins using css and storing skin setting in cookies. It also has an integrated and small footprint inline help using dhtml. The playlist is stored in cookies using PSV format. This can be backed up and restored like a cookie database.  </p>

<p>This gadget may not be a practical music player, but a nice code example and also helps understand music formats, cross browser plugins and media players.</p>
 title : The BlitzzEngine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BlitzzEngine is an ongoing project to create a basic, yet effective engine for developing 2D action games, aimed specifically at platform games. High performance is a key goal of this engine, as the target low-end machine is a 500mhz x86 processor with 64MB free RAM running at 60 FPS or higher. It will use the C++ programming language and by default the Allegro library for most game system functions.</p>

<p>The engine aims for gameplay similar to Quake and classic 2D platformers for the PC. The movement will be smooth and inertia-based (although non-inertia movement will be possible), and the system will provide most everything necessary for creating a good game.</p>

 title : The duma5 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>El sistema que se plantea en este proyecto Fin de Carrera está enmarcado dentro del paradigma de la gestión de contenidos multimedia. </p>

<p>Se propone un Servicio de búsqueda de contenidos sobre un conjunto de repositorios distribuido. El servicio accede a estos repositorios para adquirir la metainformación asociada a un activo concreto, o para seleccionar un conjunto de contenidos en base a diferentes parámetros como categorías, palabras de búsqueda, formato, etc. y los resultados parciales son unificados en un solo documento de descripción de contenidos. </p>

<p>La arquitectura está formada por módulos o plugin concretos para el acceso a cada uno de los repositorios, aunque todos ellos, se basan en un mecanismo Universal de acceso. La ampliación del sistema, desarrollando nuevos módulos de conexión a fuentes de contenido multimedia, resulta sencilla y homogénea siguiendo el marco de trabajo que se ha propuesto.  </p>

<p>Se ha definido un formato de metainformación Universal, basado en el estándar MPEG7, que permite describir las características y metadatos asociados a un activo multimedia, con independencia del tipo y procedencia del contenido. Cada plugin de acceso a un repositorio concreto, transforma los resultados obtenidos en cada consulta a este formato de descripción, común para todo el sistema, y de esta manera el conjunto total de resultados puede tratarse de manera homogénea. </p>

<p>Para comprobar el correcto funcionamiento del sistema y dotar de utilidad al servicio, de cara a usuarios finales, también se incluye el desarrollo de una aplicación multidispositivo, que permite lanzar consultas contra el Servicio, y consumir las instancias de contenido que se consideren mas apropiadas, para las características del terminal o dispositivo desde el que accede el usuario, de entre las disponibles en los resultados de la búsqueda.</p>

<p>TunVú is a highly scalable system for distributing multimedia content, which relies on the construction of multicast trees at the Application Layer, the use of distributed hash tables (DHT), as well as the peer-to-peer paradigm. Our system seeks to respond to user needs in the current scenario, where everyone wants to consume, while providing content to the community. The traditional centralized models make a use of network resources extremely inefficient, and involve high costs only acceptable by the major content distributors. Our system offers a multimedia distribution service whose cost of deployment is virtually nonexistent, also presenting a degree of efficiency much higher than the previous solutions as regards the consumption of network resources.

 summary : <p>ChaIME -- Term-based Yet Another Japanese Input Method EditorChaIME is a Japanese input method editor based on Anthy. It aims at sophisticated unknown word detection, community-based development of dictionaries, and application of generalized language model. </p>

<p>IntroductionIn recent years, the expansion of WWW allows common users to obtain large amount of text data with little effort. People get more and more used to use computers to write documents. Compared to old word processing era, the accuracy of commercial Japanese Input Method Editors (IME) become acceptable, and one can type messages in Japanese without so much stress these days. </p>

<p>Contrary, open source Operating Systems such as Linux and FreeBSD stick on using outdated IMEs such as Canna and Wnn. It was only recently that high accurate free and open source IME called Anthy came into existence. Anthy has been widely used as default Japanese IME in many modern distributions, including Ubuntu, SUSE and Mandriva. </p>

<p>Anthy first introduced statistical language model in 2005, and then (maximum entropy-based) discriminative conversion model in 2006. However, it is based on the dictionary called cannadic, which is maintained as part of Canna, and there are many parameters and resources that need hand-tuning. The requirement of human intervention makes development of Anthy hard to maintain. </p>

<p>To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel Japanese IME called ChaIME (pronounced as &quot;chime&quot;). It is based on statistical model and can estimate co-occurrence parameters automatically. It also make use of gigantic corpora extracted from the Web to develop linguistic knowledge-free IME. </p>

<p>Open IssueSlow translation (can be sped up by coverting system dictionaries into DFA) Distribution of the system including its language model (Google Japanese N-gram data cannot be distributed itself) Port to other platforms (SCIM, uim, Emacs) AcknowledgementThis IME is partly supported by the Creative and International Competitiveness Project 2007, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.</p>

 summary : <p>Front page slideshow for DrupalThis is a module to be able to easily configure and add the Front Page Slideshow from JoomlaWorks to Drupal. </p>

<p>The idea is to create a slideshow and add slides as you would add any other story. The slideshow is then set up as a block which can be put anywhere on the site on any page you want. </p>

<p>For the module to work you will have to pay for and download Front Page Slideshow. </p>

<p>Frontpage Slideshow for Drupal is now on drupal.orgThis project will no longer be updated on hereFuture of Front page slideshow for Drupal?Development is ongoing.  Once the module has been made as solid as possible within Drupal 5 I will try to port it over to 6 and possibly make use of extra features in Drupal 6, this may also mean the removal of the dependency of jquery_update. </p>

<p>DemoA demo of the front page slideshow for Drupal is available at http://drupal.jamestombs.co.uk </p>

<p>UpdatesUpdate 18/11/2008 - Development release </p>

<p>Fixes: </p>

<p>Access permissions actually work now Changed code to comply with the Drupal standards </p>

<p>New Features: </p>

<p>Permissions can be set to allow certain users to be able to chose a theme, otherwise they will be restricted to the default theme selecting on the admin page Permissions can be set to allow users to add a slide to any slideshow, by default they are only able to add slides to slideshows created by themselves Changed upload image feature. Each slide has an upload form and the dependency of the upload module has been removed </p>

<p>Still to do: </p>

<p>Improve the upload feature to allow uploading of images on a slide update </p>

<p>As always any issues please post them in the Issues section at the top. </p>

<p>Problem with the fpss-20081108_1826 release.  Please use the fpss-20081108_0058 release. </p>

<p>Further update 08/11/2008 </p>

<p>Release fpss-20081108_1826 has a few changes to try to eliminate any problems with conflicting modules which may also add a slideshow content type. </p>

<p>A database update will need to be run. </p>

<p>Update 08/11/2008 </p>

<p>New Features: </p>

<p>Set a template per slideshow rather than a generic sitewide template Able to set the template for each slideshow to random, allowing a new template per page refresh Fixes: Added closing paragraph tags to some of the form item descriptions Updated a few descriptions </p>

<p>Update 07/11/2008 </p>

<p>Slide URL has been changed so that external URLs can be used (see issue #6) Updated some descriptions on some fields Update 24/10/2008 </p>

<p>Another update.  Slightly bigger and more useful update though. </p>

<p>New Features: </p>

<p>Remove languages folder usage and allow direct input in to Drupal for immediate change of text terms used.  Comes with English installed by default.  Can be changed through the Front Page Slideshow admin screen. Added ability to move javascript to the footer, assuming the theme supports it. Tested on a bare Drupal installation and worked perfectly. </p>

<p>Fixes: </p>

<p>Permissions should now be set properly for accessing the admin screen. Removed the description input on the slide content form as it was unnecessary. </p>

<p>Update 23/10/2008 </p>

<p>Another small fix.  When editing an existing slide node the Slideshow value isn&#39;t set. </p>

<p>Fixed with #default_value. </p>

<p>Have a few little bugs creeping up like not working in Firefox in some settings and slidetext not appearing properly in the slideshow. </p>

<p>Update 22/10/2008 </p>

<p>Another small bug fix. </p>

<p>Line 690 was written as: </p>

<p>$sql = &quot;SELECT vid, title FROM {node} WHERE type = &#39;%s&#39; AND status = %d&quot;;Should be: </p>

<p>$sql = &quot;SELECT vid, title FROM {node} n WHERE type = &#39;%s&#39; AND status = %d&quot;;Another one: </p>

<p>Wrong jQuery included. </p>

<p>Update 16/10/2008 </p>

<p>Small bug fix for accessing the admin settings under any other user than uid = 1. </p>

<p>I am beginning work on trying to get the slideshow and slide creation work better and hopefully remove the dependency on jquery_update but still have it work with jquery_update, but this may not be possible. </p>

<p>Update 23/05/2008 </p>

<p>The code has now been updated to create slideshows as a content type as well as slides.  This way you can easily add, edit and delete multiple slideshow.  When you create a slide you are giving a list of slideshow to which you can add the slide to.  At the moment the module is limited to each slide being associated with only one slideshow.  If the same slide is required on 2 different slideshows, the slide must be duplicated and the slideshow changed on the copy. </p>

<p>Javascript now works with existing drupal jQuery functions with jQuery_Update installed. jQuery_Update is now a dependencies of fpss.  This updates jQuery to 1.2.3.  fpss now works with the following settings configurations: </p>

 title : The gapbuffer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Gap buffers are efficient mutable sequences. They are most often used to store text in text editors. They utilize locality of modification to avoid copying large amounts of data and allocate extra elements to avoid memory allocation dominating performance. The extra allocated items provide a movable gap between the two parts that contain data. Insertions and deletions occur at the gap. </p>

<p>For a description of gap buffers see Data Structures in a Bit-Mapped Text Editor, Wilfred J. Hanson, Byte January 1987 </p>

<p>The item type for the gap buffer may be character, Unicode character, or integer and is determined from the type of the constructor argument with a list interpreted as integer: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from gapbuffer import GapBuffer
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print GapBuffer(&#39;The life of Brian&#39;)
<br/>The life of Brian
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print GapBuffer(u&#39;Mr Creosote&#39;)
<br/>Mr Creosote
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print GapBuffer([1,2,3])
<br/>GapBuffer(&#39;i&#39;) [1, 2, 3]The example use Python 2.x syntax although GapBuffer will also work with Python 3.x. </p>

<p>GapBuffer implements Python&#39;s sequence protocol: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie = GapBuffer(&#39;The life of Brian&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie[:] = &#39;The meaning - with Life&#39;; print movie
<br/>The meaning - with Life
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; del movie[12:14]; print movie
<br/>The meaning with Life
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie[4] = &#39;M&#39;; print movie
<br/>The Meaning with Life
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie[12:16] = &#39;of&#39;; print movie
<br/>The Meaning of Life
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print movie[0:3]
<br/>The
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print len(movie)
<br/>19GapBuffer has insert and extend methods similar to Python lists: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie.insert(0, &#39;\&#39;&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie.extend(&#39;\&#39;!&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print movie
<br/>&#39;The Meaning of Life&#39;!Portions can be retrieved as strings directly rather than by a slice and conversion to avoid copying twice with retrieve(start, length): </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; print movie.retrieve(5,7)
<br/>MeaningA GapBuffer will not release memory unless asked: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; print movie.size
<br/>25
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie[:] = &#39;ab&#39;; print movie.size
<br/>25
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie.slim(); print movie.size
<br/>8The values of a segment may be added to with increment(start, length, value). This is useful for maintaining the starting position of every line in a document, for example. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; positions = GapBuffer([100, 140, 220, 280])
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; positions.increment(1,3,-7)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print positions
<br/>GapBuffer(&#39;i&#39;) [100, 133, 213, 273]The buffer protocol is implemented which allows use with features such as regular expression searches and writing to file: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; movie = GapBuffer(u&#39;The life of Brian&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print movie
<br/>The life of Brian
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; r = re.compile(&#39;B[a-z]+&#39;, re.M)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; where = r.search(movie)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print where.group(0)
<br/>BrianIssuesMore item types could be implemented, possibly all of those available from the array module with a typecode keyword parameter to the constructor specifying the item type. Possibly use different names rather than a typecode: CharDoc, UnicodeDoc. </p>

<p>The code is too messy with detailed knowledge of the data structure spread throughout the code. This should be regularized as should be the consumption of arguments so it is easier to add methods and item types. </p>

<p>CodeUnit tests for gapbuffer </p>

<p>DiscussionSince this is a small simple module there will not be a mailing list. The news group comp.lang.python is probably the best place to talk about gapbuffer. Do not send messages about gapbuffer to my personal email address.</p>

 title : The mac-applescript-devtool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of this project is to add IDE-like features to the Finder and to your basic Mac text editor such as BBEdit, TextWrangler SubEthaEdit, Smultron, Xcode, etc. For instance, press a hotkey and the script automatically identifies/locates the build action for the current project based on the active/frontmost file and invokes it. In other words, this build system mostly INFERS what to do based on the context of the active edited file or based on the current path in the Finder. It scans the Finder path looking for an Ant build file, an index.html file to invoke, or even a secondary script file to invoke if that customization is desired, can even invoke an xcode project directly from your text editor or the Finder.  In this fashion, XCode really just becomes a slave of your text editor.  Build actions will initially include invoking Java Ant, building for Flex using the Flex Compiler Shell (fcsh) , or invoking a script which validates the syntax of your JavaScript projects. Additional actions may later be included. If a build failure occurs for any of the build types listed above, the errors are thrown back to your text editor via AppleScript. </p>

<p>Keep everything simple and natural - it really is not very natural to be have to manage project windows in an IDE because all those files exist in the Finder and your file system anyway. </p>

<p>Background: I have recently been using jEdit mainly for much Java-based development. I had also written a columnar browser for jEdit in the past. I have decided to switch back to using native Mac apps for development and use AppleScript glue. No other IDE I&#39;m aware of provides a columnar browser to navigate projects. So I have decided to switch my development to somewhat BareBones: use a plain text editor and revert to using the columnar views of the Finder to navigate my projects. And use AppleScript glue. Another way of looking at this project is similar to TextMate&#39;s bundles perhaps but not tied to any specific text editor. </p>

<p>Please join this project and help us enhance the scripts! Thanks every body. The admin Philip can be reached at philip aat philmaker d.t com </p>

<p>Goals: </p>

<p>The Finder has historically included the menu option &quot;Print&quot;. This project will also add the command &quot;Run Project&quot; to the Finder and/or from your text editor. The Finder supports at least three different sorts of views. Most IDEs and text editors do not. No Mac IDE that I am aware of supports the column view for projects and projects files. So, a goal of this project to to simply use the Finder for project navigation and project definition. Be able to run/build/invoke any sort of programming project from inside your text editor. (modular) Might use a tool like Spark (http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark3.php) - but also consider creating a key command registry as a scripting addition. Perhaps ultimately, eventually use portions of AppleScript Studio.</p>
 summary : <p>Marginalia is an open source Javascript web annotation system that allows users of web applications to highlight text and write margin notes.  Marginalia has been integrated into several web applications: </p>

<p>An extension to Moodle adds annotation to Moodle discussion forums. A plug-in for Open Journal Systems allows readers to annotate journal articles. Marginalia is part of the Bungeni parliamentary and legislative information system. A stand-alone demo implementation provides a minimal sample implementation as a demonstration of how to integrate Marginalia with other web applications. The annotation feature supports recent versions of major browsers (Firefox, Safari, and IE), but works best and fastest in Firefox.  The features are integrated into and work with a host web application with no need for special browser or other client software. </p>

<p>If you have seen other web annotation systems (e.g. Diigo), Marginalia is different.  First because it actually displays annotations in a margin next to the annotated text, which is highlighted;  second because of its close integration into the host application.  For example, Marginalia uses your login name and permissions from the application.  In Moodle, Marginalia can search for and filter annotations by discussion, by forum, by course, and by user, and there&#39;s a button that will paste an annotation (author, quote, margin note) into a forum post reply or start a new post if necessary. </p>

<p>Note that as of December 2008 Marginalia includes significant feature changes, such as support for Internet Explorer and the quote feature mentioned above.  It is currently in Beta.  It is in need of testing and likely has bugs, especially when it comes to upgrading existing annotations.  I appreciate anyone who is willing to take the time to try it out.  You can reach me with questions and bug reports at email geof geof net (add appropriate punctuation: @ and .).  I also appreciate hearing from anyone who installs it successfully and finds it useful. </p>

 title : The mobileworkstation Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main objective of this project is as the title states to develop a complete solution (including software, infrastructure and services) for mobile devices.  The specific objectives are the following: </p>

<p>Create/modify a java based VNC client to allow mobile devices (mobile phones, PDAs, etc) to connect to a specific computer on the internet.   Provide specialized VNC servers with Open Source based applications to use in the mobile devices. The server must be able to know the properties of the client screen to present the applications in the best possible way. When each user logins to a Server, it has a personal desktop and profile. There is also a &quot;folder&quot; to share files between its mobile device and the VNC server. Develop/modify Open Source applications to run in the VNC servers. These applications should adapt their interfaces according to the properties of the VNC clients. Possible applications are: Spreadsheets Text Editors Games Text recognition  (text recognition should be better with the increased processing power allowed by the use of the servers) Establish  connection servers close to locations where the majority of users are likely to connect. The user profiles should be pulled from the data servers but the immediate processing can be done in the close servers. Benefits: </p>

<p>Theoretically limitless processing power available at the fingertips without the use of a Laptop A huge variety of software available to run in the mobile devices (possibly all the Open Source software available) Disadvantages: The need of extra infrastructure (the connection servers) to ensure the fast transmission of data between the VNC server and client. 	 Considerations: A ssh2/X forwarding soultion (like jsch and WeirdX) may be more suitable than VNC. The modifications to the Open Source applications include the input and output interfaces (touch, mobile keyboards, etc).  The VNC server/client should be able to forward sound and to provide full motion video. Great possibility of data gathering and mining via the user&#39;s profiles, data and applications Focused Advertising related to users current applications, data, etc. (the desktop of the VNC server could be composed of dynamic advertisements for example, or a user defined desktop but with a layer of text adds at one side). Possible extra profits by publishing third party applications in the system.</p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionOpenWSN means Open Wireless Sensor Networks. It&#39;s a fundamental platform for WSN research and applications. It was initiated by TongJi University . The first version of OpenWSN is based on LPC213x/LPC214x ARM7 + TI/Chipcon cc2420. The default configuration is LPC2146. The second version is based on Atmega128 MCU and ICT GAINZ hardware. </p>

<p>OpenWSN hopes it can be widely used in the society and powers the smart sensor to make us live better. According to our prediction, the huge number of smart sensors will become an important infrastructure like 3G and Internet-2 in the future. While, while, OpenWSN powers 1/3 of them! </p>

 title : The pecha-pub Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PechaPublisherWhat is PechaPublisher?A Publishing ToolFrom its desktop publishing article, Wikipedia has this to say: </p>

<p>Desktop publishing combines a personal computer and page layout software to create publication documents on a computer for either large scale publishing or small scale local economical multifunction peripheral output and distribution. </p>

<p>A Typesetting ToolLikewise, Wikipedia provides the following definition of typesetting: </p>

<p>the composition of glyphs into lines to form body matter, headings, captions and other pieces of text to make up a page image, and the printing or transfer of the page image onto paper and other media. </p>

<p>PechaPublisher aims to provide a desktop publishing environment  combined with typesetting tools for those interested in creating and publishing Tibetan pecha texts.  </p>

<p>Not a Word Processor!We are not trying to invent nor reinvent word processing for Tibetan. There are many products that do this today, and as unicode becomes increasingly more popular in the Tibetan text creation, digitization, and creation communities, the number of usable products increases. </p>

<p>Tell me more!Besides the notes below, be sure to check out the wiki FrontPage for continually updated project content -- everything from development plans to software documentation. For some instant gratification, you can check out our slowly growing ScreenShots page. </p>

<p>Where did PechaPublisher come from?PechaPublisher is inspired through the use of PechaMaker as well as feature requests expressed by users, editors, and teachers/lamas. In addition, PechaPublisher derives some of its lineage from the work done on the following projects: </p>

<p>AdytumSolutions&#39; pecha-related libraries PyRTF and pyrtf-ng </p>

<p>Where is it going?It is anticipated that this software will become the open-source heir to the free (but closed-source) software PechaMaker. Similar to PechaMaker, PechaPublisher has no goals of becoming word processor for Tibetan texts: there are other projects dedicated to this, and with the advent of Tibetan unicode fonts, there is ever decreasing need for Tibetan-specific word processors.</p>
 title : The personaloffice Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Personal Office is a multi-purpose Windows application fully based on plug-ins. Basically the main application is just a &quot;host&quot;, it does not have any knowledge on what plug-ins are doing, what are their menus or toolbars etc. The plug-ins are automatically confuguring the &quot;host&quot; application (the &quot;console&quot;) telling it what they can do and how. </p>

<p>Currently, the project is at a concept level only, testing if all things planed are possible. The only plugin (Rich Text Editor) is now &quot;hardcoded&quot; for testing purposes.</p>
 title : The pxshop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project will be started once my current project (Asic) will be finished. It will be written in C++ and with wxWidgets for both Windows and Linux (and maybe ported after to mac, bsd, etc. (even if it yet exists an alternative for mac)). </p>

<p>It will have some features like: </p>

<p>Layers. Opacity Rendering Groups Multi-views on one document (like with advanced text-editors, such vim) with different zooms and on different parts. Complete history (and undo/redo functions). A one pixel eraser. Transparent initial background. The possibility of setting a model in background (reduced to match the size of the canvas, but not zoomed in (not with &quot;big ugly pixels&quot;), indeed). Symmetric edition capable. Color picker able to pick average color on a given area. Interpolation processing, to recreate vectorized line art from a rasterized one. Multi File-Formats correct handling (png, jpg, bmp, ico, etc).</p>
 title : The quicktext Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Quick text is a plug-ins for the popular editor notepad plus plus. Using TAB allows code segment to be inserted quickly. The plug-ins also has option for Add/Modify quick tags. Which changes the QuickText.ini file. The project file is maintained specially for java,php,html languages. </p>

<p>Codepress is a web based editor with has similar functionality. Its language files are used for quick text by pressing TAB. </p>

<p>Netbeans has this feature known as Code Template. The modified code template is stored at </p>

<p>Documents and Settings/&quot;user&quot;/.netbeans/&quot;version&quot;/config/Editors/text/&quot;language&quot;/Code Templates/ </p>

<p>The default shortcut key is also Tab, however it can be changed from tools menu.</p>
 title : The s3-bash Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>s3-bashAmazon&#39;s S3 is an original service. Many people use it - but until now it&#39;s needed knowledge of a programming language to use it. </p>

<p>s3-bash is a small collection of BASH scripts to let you use it from an Unix, Linux or Mac OS X command line without needing Perl, Python, Java, .Net, etc... </p>

<p>Using ItJust unpack the tar! </p>

<p>To get files: use ./s3-get To put files: use ./s3-put To delete files: use ./s3-delete All of these programs take -h for help. </p>

<p>DependenciesIf you&#39;re using Linux or Cygwin, you will need to have gnu coreutils (textutils as was), curl and OpenSSL installed. These are pretty standard on most modern distributions. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re using a Mac, we&#39;ve only tested this on Mac OX X Tiger. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve made some changes in 0.01 so that it now works irrespective of your locale and does basic checking for corrupt secret keys. </p>

<p>NotesAmazon custom headers are not completely supported yet. Temporary files are not properly cleaned up (/tmp/s3-*). These can be deleted by hand. The Amazon custom date header is not supported as it is not needed. The format of the custom header file is header: value. We do no support repeated headers or long headers folded on to a new line (rarely encountered). Coooool(Well, we think it is) The bash code in s3-common-functions implements the HMAC part of HMAC-SHA1 in pure bash...</p>

 summary : <p>Simplest Possible Blogging SystemA blogging system that doesn&#39;t use a database or have a web interface? What are we thinking? </p>

<p>Frankly, we&#39;re thinking that we don&#39;t want our blog to be such a bother. We&#39;ve minimized the number of &quot;moving parts&quot; -- we wanted to remove as many possible points of failure as we could. </p>

<p>There&#39;s almost no configuration, it&#39;s compatible with every web host out there, it&#39;s almost impervious to hacks and spam, and it requires no maintenance. As long as the web host stays in business, an SPBS website should stay up for essentially forever. As long as there&#39;s browsers capable of rendering HTML, an SPBS site will keep going. </p>

 title : The swtfinder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>During my work for Journalizer I created a plugin for TinyMCE. What does it do? Well, it solves a problem, but which one? We have list of TinyMCE-controlled textareas and it is so common that you use the tab-key to jump to the next field that we wanted that as well. Unfortunately, this doesn&#39;t work in TinyMCE. </p>

<p>Why is that? When using TinyMCE, you declare a HTML form element as &quot;managed&quot; by TinyMCE. What it does is substituting the actual HTML element with an iframe that can be edited like rich text. I.e. you can make things bold and italic and all that just with a click on button and you immediately see the results — nice. But because the actual textarea gets replaced by the iframe, common &quot;tabbing&quot; through your form elements no longer works because iframes are no form elements — not so nice. </p>

<p>What the plugin does is intercepting keyboard events for the current iframe. When tab is hit, it looks up the next element to focus and voilà turns over the focus. Just as if it were a regular form element. </p>

<p>You can either specify target elements to tab to, or let tabjump detect the next form element.</p>

 summary : <p>Project InfoThis project aims to facilitate the usage of the Spring Framework for wiring Eclipse RCP components together and to any other services you would wish to use.  The way it works is by providing two plug-ins your work will depend on.  These provide a hook for you to wire your views (and all subsequent code) via the bean factory.  Additional utility classes for working with Spring in an Eclipse RCP environment will be included, as well.  </p>

<p>This work is a derivative of the Eclipse-Spring originally released under Commons Public License by Nick Bartlett.   </p>

<p>NewsMay 23, 2007We should have the first release within the week.  This release will be 0.1.  Point releases will be feature enhancements towards 1.0.  0.1 is a feature release, 0.1.1 is a bug fix on that release.  Before the next feature release, we&#39;ll establish a road map.  I don&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll wait long before pushing to 1.0.</p>

 title : The equinox-spring Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Building an equinox server that follow the eclipse model for features (set of bundles) deployment.  </p>

<p>Adding the support of spring components (dm, mvc, security) with the way of multiple bundles can contribute to the static resources of a web application. By static resources I mean  images, CSS, HTML, JSPs, PDFs, etc. </p>

<p>The target will provide a web server application where each features are decentralized (tomcat is a centralized) and can be updated separately. </p>

<p>HOWTOdownload eclipse rcp + the svn plugin import the projectSet.psf run the first example, two webmodules (one spring security and one spring mvc) test.equinox.mvc/OSGi MVC(+security).launch http://localhost:8080/a/index.jsp (admin/admin) http://localhost:8080/b/index.jsp (Two webmodules that share the same session!!) run the second example to see only one webmodule that NOT depend on spring security  First, comment all entries on test.equinox.mvc/META-INF/osgi.xml run test.equinox.mvc/OSGi MVC.launch tryhttp://localhost:8080/b/index.jsp Enjoy with two webapps that share the same context and that are glued on runtime ;)  </p>

<p>TODOupdate manager bunlde and servlets (list features, update, start/stop) chain the restart of bundles that depends on clean/better meta webapp definition  wait for spring and eclipse releases to get these features ;) a lot...</p>

 title : The simple-spring-memcached Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Distributed caching can be a big, hairy, intricate, and complex proposition when using it extensively. </p>

<p>Simple Spring Memcached (SSM) attempts to simplify implementation for several basic use cases. </p>

<p>This project enables caching in Spring-managed beans, by using Java 5 Annotations and Spring/AspectJ AOP on top of the spymemcached or xmemcached client. Using Simple Spring Memcached requires only a little bit of configuration and the addition of some specific annotations on the methods whose output or input is being cached. 
<br/>It also provides integration with Spring Cache abstraction.</p>

<p>SSM is available in central maven repository.</p>

 title : The spring-composition Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My name is Sam Alston and my colleague is Hector Rovira.  We are Java Web Developers and heavy users of the Spring Framework.  In fact, many of the web applications we&#39;ve been a part of rely upon the Spring MVC framework. </p>

<p>As our applications have grown, Hector identified some areas were we could reuse code, but only if we had Controllers that relied more on Composition rather than Inheritance (which is the current pattern to follow when using AbstractController, SimpleFormController, MultiActionController, etc...)  He noticed that the Validators are injected into the Form Controllers, and proposed that we carried the same pattern into other areas of the controller lifecycle.  So the new design offers several interfaces that hook into the lifecycles of the Action and Form Controllers. </p>

<p>We have developed Composition-based Controllers that are easily configured through Spring application context files and injected with reusable ReferenceDataProviders, RequestObjectProviders, ModelProviders, FormBinders, etc...  As a result of this, we have achieved our goal of making our code more reusable, our unit tests more concise and practical.  We have also noticed that less code is being written to facilitate integration. </p>

<p>Here is a short outline of the new Classes and Interfaces: </p>

<p>CompositionActionController o Extends from AbstractController 
<br/>o Injected with the following objects: 
<br/>+ View name - The view to be used with the Action  
<br/>+ RequestAction(s) - The functionality (business logic) to be executed when receiving the request 
<br/>+ ModelProvider(s) - provides one or more objects to be injected into the given ModelAndView  
<br/>CancellableCompositionFormController o Extends from CancellableFormController 
<br/>o Injected with the following objects: 
<br/>+ Form View name - The view presented to the user on the first request 
<br/>+ Success View name - The view to be used in the success scenario 
<br/>+ Cancel View name - The view to be used in the cancel scenario 
<br/>+ InitBinder(s) - Binds editors into the ServletRequestDataBinder 
<br/>+ FormBackerProvider(s) - Provides (or modifies) a command object 
<br/>+ ReferenceDataProvider(s) - Provides one or more objects to be used in the form&#39;s ModelAndView (Similar to ModelProvider) 
<br/>+ FormBinder(s) - Performs complex form binding on the command object 
<br/>+ Validator(s) - Assures the content matches the command object&#39;s requirements 
<br/>+ SubmitAction(s) - The functionality (business logic) to be executed when receiving a Submit request 
<br/>+ CancelAction(s) - The functionality (business logic) to be executed when receiving a Cancel request  
<br/>CompositionWizardFormController o Extends from AbstractWizardFormController 
<br/>o Injected with all the same objects as the the CancellableCompositionFormController, except that the FormBinders, Validators and ReferenceDataProviders are registered on a per-page basis. 
<br/>The entire code base can be found at http://code.google.com/p/spring-composition , along with a simple demo application. </p>
