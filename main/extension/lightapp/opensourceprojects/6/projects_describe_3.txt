 summary : <p>Please see our public website, located at http://php-sugar.net.Introduction to PHP-SugarPHP-Sugar is a new template engine for PHP, similar in intent to Smarty. </p>

<p>A powerful and flexible compilation engine is used which allows for powerful expressions similar to that of PHP itself.  It also features a clean and easy to understand syntax, which was created with the average designer in mind. </p>

<p>Security is a strength of PHP-Sugar.  For example, output is HTML-escaped by default, instead of requiring explicit escaping like PHP itself, which makes it far less likely to accidentally introduce an HTML or JavaScript code injection vulnerability from user-submitted content. </p>

<p>ExamplesThese are the tests used for development of PHP-Sugar. </p>

 title : The phpbrowscap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Browser Capabilities PHP ProjectHACKING AROUND WITH PHP TO HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION THAN GET_BROWSER() </p>

<p>IntroductionThe browscap.ini file is a database maintained by Gary Keith at http://browsers.garykeith.com/ which provides a lot of details about browsers and their capabilities, such as name, versions, Javascript support and so on. </p>

<p>PHP&#39;s native get_browser() function parses this file and provides you with a complete set of information about every browser&#39;s details. But it requires the path to the browscap.ini file to be specified in the php.ini browscap directive which is flagged as PHP_INI_SYSTEM. That means in most shared hosting environments you cannot edit the php.ini file. </p>

<p>Browscap is a standalone class for both PHP4 and PHP5 that gets around the limitations of get_browser() and manages the whole thing. It offers methods to update, cache, adapt and get details about every supplied user agent on a standalone basis. </p>

<p>FeaturesHere is a feature list of the Browscap class: </p>

<p>Fast Standalone Even faster parsing many user agents Fully get_browser() compatible Often faster and more accurate than get_browser() Fully PHP configuration independent User agent auto-detection Returns object or array Parsed .ini file cached directly into PHP arrays Accepts any .ini file (even ASP and lite versions) Auto updated browscap.ini file and cache from remote server with version checking Configurable remote update server Fully configurable (since 0.2) --PHP4 and-- PHP5 compatible (PHP4 version deprecated) Released under the GNU Lesser General Public License </p>

<p>svn co http://svn.asdfjkl.com.au/tact/trunkCheck out the Quick Start Guide to see what you can do, and get started </p>

<p>RequirementsLinux (Not yet tested in Windows) PHP Version =&gt; 5.1.6 (5.2.5 Recommended) Modules: php-pdo, php-json Note: json is strongly recommended, however if its not found it will fall-back to its own implementation of json. Recommended: php-cli, if you want to run the command line scripts Note: magic_quotes_gpc must be off, either by .htaccess or in the php.ini file DatabasesThe included PDB class which controls connectivity to the database supports (In order of tested installs) MySQL via PDO (Easily) Oracle via PDO (Yes it does work! As long as you&#39;ve compiled your PDO w/ Oracle) SQL Server via PDO (Nothing in production that I know of) However, you don&#39;t even need to use PDB and can use whatever else you wish, but some Components require the PDB Class Structure to work correctly BackgroundThe following frameworks had some influence on the initial direction of tact, you could say TACT is a mixture of these: </p>

 title : The splunk-php-sdk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a library with source code and examples written in PHP for coding against the Splunk Platform APIs. </p>

<p>More information on coding against Splunk is hosted over on the Splunk Labs pages at: http://code.google.com/p/splunk-labs/ </p>

<p>Splunk&#39;s PHP SDKSplunk&#39;s PHP SDK is a public domain library providing PHP development wrapper for projects based around Splunk&#39;s search engine. </p>

<p>Please note this an early beta release of the SDK, and as such, hasn&#39;t been throughly tested.  If you find any bugs, or need assistance feel free to leave a comment on the Splunk Labs list. </p>

<p>You can request to join the Splunk Labs project here on Google Code by emailing your Gmail email address in the SUBJECT line of your email to splunk-labs@splunk.com. </p>

<p>IntroductionSplunk PHP SDK is a wrapper around Splunk&#39;s REST API, providing an object model for the major functional components of the Splunk server. The following components are currently accessible via the SDK: </p>

<p>Authentication Search Configuration </p>

<p>We continue to work on implementing the wrappers for the other components of the server, including user roles and permissions. </p>

<p>There are many levels of possible Splunk integration, so we provided developers the ability to communicate with the Platform API - from raw http streaming to custom-tailored objects and SQL-style components. </p>

<p>RequirementsSplunk PHP SDK client is dependent on two external libraries that you will need to have installed: </p>

<p>PHP CURL Installation instructions PHP DOMXML Installation instructions </p>

<p>Installation  Splunk PHP SDK comes in a form of several php files that have to be made accessible from your project. Get the latest stable version of the sdk from the trunk or check out a more featured, but less stable branch. </p>

<p>DocumentationDocumentation section is currently under construction. </p>

<p>Example usageNOTE This and the following examples are provided for the unstable version of the sdk. </p>

<p>This simple example establishes a connection with a Splunk server, using it to dispatch a new search job. Then it receives search results and sends them to standard output. </p>

<p>Authenticate();</p>

<p>echo &quot;Creating Search Job...&quot;.&quot;\n&quot;;
<br/>$searchMgr = new SearchManager($con);
<br/>$job_id = $searchMgr-&gt;syncSearch(&#39;search error&#39;, null);</p>

<p>echo &quot;Retrieving Job Events...&quot;.&quot;\n&quot;;
<br/>$events = $searchMgr-&gt;getJobEvents($job_id, true, null);
<br/>foreach($events as $event)
<br/>	print_r($event);</p>

<p>echo &quot;Deleting The Job... &quot;.&quot;\n&quot;;
<br/>$searchMgr-&gt;deleteJob($job_id);
<br/>?&gt;More ExamplesIf you host a Splunk install on your own server you don&#39;t need to obtain a public API key. A session key will be assigned to your program automatically based on your login and password. </p>

<p>Dispatching and controlling search jobs. Listing search jobs. Working with configuration files.   </p>

 title : The uniqid-php Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library is useful anytime you need an unique ID, e.g. in web forms. Each uniqID is generated only once, assigned with the IP address of the client, and cannot be used more than once. The library contains two functions: </p>

<p>The first one, getuniq(), generates an unique string (26 characters long), ready for using in the HIDDEN field in HTML FORM, i.e. in comment form. </p>

<p>The second one, called checkuniq(), takes the submitted uniqID as its parameter and returns 1, if the passed uniqID string is valid, or 0 if invalid. &#39;Valid uniqID&#39; means it has been generated but not yet checked.  </p>

<p>The library provides that the once used uniqID won&#39;t be generated again anytime in the future as so as anytime in the past.</p>
 title : The ups-php Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Update 08/20/2009I have had a lot of people emailing me for support for various modules and integration specific questions.  Because of this, I have made a commercial product called, RocketShipIt.  It supports all the UPS Online Tools APIs as well as generates the 40+ required files you need to get certified with UPS.  With the purchase of the product you also get support and help with any integration questions you might have. </p>

<p>What about ups-php?I will still remain active and update this code but integration specific support will be slower. </p>

<p>AboutThis project was started as we have found there is a need for modules written in PHP to communicate with the UPS Shipping API. </p>

<p>Mark has already written code that calculates UPS shipping rates using the API.  This was the first implementation.</p>

 summary : <p>Lightweight distro, SMP-enabled kernel but CPU-compatible down to to a Pentium II. Suggested min. configuration is a PII-400 with 128mb. </p>

<p>This is Slackware with general desktop use in mind. Many utilities are included for easy setup and maintenance, but all the old Slackware ways still apply... stable, low-overhead, secure. All system configuration MUST be done as root. This is for security and to enable low maintenance in a school or business setting. </p>

<p>All-at-once installer puts all libraries and packages in at once, taking up about 1.8 GB of HDD space. Can be installed as per Slackware, but AUTOINSTALL (which partitions hard drive automatically) is also an option. Pcmanfm is the default window manager running on Icewm. Rox-filer is also available and is complimentary to pcmanfm.  </p>

<p>K3B is the burning software, base install includes GIMP-2.6 (with extra script-fus), AbiWord-2.6.4, games, Thunderbird email client, ftp client, PDF viewer and a PDF editor, two installed (not online) dictionaries, Pidgin IM, a separate menu JUST for Linux and application documentation, video/audio players...  </p>

<p>A few Multimedia features are not installed by default due to distribution restrictions in some areas of the world -- to facilitate use by those who can/choose to, there is an automated installer for these available to the root user. So if you want to play DVDs and/or convert MP3s or play a few of the different video types shown online that don&#39;t play by default -- just run the Extended Multimedia Installer.  </p>

<p>CD2 includes OpenOffice, Deluge (torrents), Inkscape, Frostwire (P2P), several extra games, Scribus (desktop publishing), BibleTime, extended documentation, development related programs and several others.</p>

 title : The acer-n311-linux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThe goal of the project is to create Linux kernel for Acer n311. </p>

<p>Acer n311 is based on Samsung S3C2440X platform which supports Linux. So the remaining work includes writing machine-specific code and device drivers. Much work has been already done for E-ten G500 and for HP RX1950 which have very similar design. But the support for touchscreen, buttons and built-in graphics chip NVidia GoForce 4000 is crucial for normal usage. </p>

<p>NewsThe current 2.6.29-n311 kernel enabled experimental support of audio codec! Thanks to polachok and rx1950 linux team for the driver. </p>

<p>The work on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support has been started by AiFiLTr0. </p>

<p>Now the kernel has support for buttons and blue LED. Thanks to polachok! He&#39;s also working hard to get audio codec working. </p>

<p>Since X works, you can try some GUI on n311! </p>

<p>With initrd from G500 project kernel boots to login prompt. One can log in using the USB connection. </p>

<p>See the hardware support status on the HardwareSupport page. </p>

<p>Some photos can be found on the PhotoPage. </p>

<p>Screen supportNow both frame buffer console and X work fine. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve written simple frame buffer device driver, so it&#39;s now possible to read the kernel messages on the screen. However, there were unusual problems with text scrolling and stability(they are gone with the current release). This short video on YouTube represents the state of screen support in deprecated n311-zImage-0.01 version. </p>

<p>How to runCurrently the kernel bootloader is HaRET. </p>

<p> Get zImage from the Downloads section.  Get HaRET 0.5.1 or later version.  Angstrom rootfs from rx3000 with Opie Desktop Environment is available ftp://downloads.tuxfamily.org/linuxrx1950/rootfs/Angstrom-opie-image-glibc-test-20070620-rx3000.rootfs.tar.bz2. Go to SdCardBoot for instructions.  Prepare default.txt according to HaretConfig.  If you want to connect through USB, get some knowledge from these instructions and appropriately edit /etc/network/interfaces on your host and PDA.  Tap &#39;Run&#39;.  Enjoy! </p>

<p>How to developFor the kernel patches please refer to Source section. </p>

<p>If you want to build software for PDA, it&#39;s better you use QEMU. Get the armv4l system image from uClibc: http://uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/ and compile the software you need.</p>

 title : The atv-bootloader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Frustrated creating an AppleTV based linux system. Nervous about voiding the warrantee by opening the AppleTV to get access to the internal hard drive. Tired of following voodoo instructions just to build bootable USB pen patchstick to install sshd? Well, atv-bootloader is for you.  </p>

<p>AnnouncingThis just in, ATVUSB-Creator has been released for the OSX platform, see http://atvusb-creator.googlecode.com for details. The other two platforms (LInux and Windows) should be released in a week or so. Say goodbye to manual creation of an atv-bootloader USB flash drive, ATVUSB-Creator to the rescue. If you are looking to install Boxee or XBMC on your AppleTV under the native AppleTV OS, head on over. 
<br/>AppleTVhardware software performance MPlayer MythTV XBMC video playback DetailsHistory The AppleTV is a really neat device. The normal AppleTV is pretty good but lacks hardware assisted nvidia mepg2 decode capabilities. This means that one it limited to 720p mpeg2. To do 1080i mpeg2 decode one needs to look toward the Linux OS as there are existing drivers for nvidia hardware decode. Other bootloaders First Linux boot was done by Edgar (gimli) Hucek at http://www.mactel-linux.org/wiki/AppleTV. This bootloader was called &quot;mach_linux_boot&quot; and required the linux kernel to be compiled into the resulting mach_kernel. This worked great but was a little limited in updating the Linux kernel was a pain. The second bootloader was &quot;mb_boot_tv&quot; done by James McKenzie at http://www.mythic-beasts.com/resources/appletv/ . This bootloader extended mach_linux_boot by enabling the bootloader to search over the internal ata bus and find a boot config that would be used to load the Linux kernel. Network boot was also enabled. This was better, now the kernel could be updated without recompiling the mach_kernel. However, one could netboot using a USB disk but not boot a USB based Linux system. In addition, because mb_boot_tv used it&#39;s own boot config format, changes made to grubs menu.lst file during updates required manually updating mb_boot_tv.conf. ATV-Bootloader atv-bootloader which uses principals from mach_linux_boot to boot a compiled-in Linux kernel and then finds and boots another Linux kernel using kexec (a user-land kernel bootloader). In addition, atv-bootloader translates several EFI structures into standard PC bios structures. This allows a standard Linux kernel to be booted without the numerous EFI patches required by both mach_linux_boot and mb_boot_tv. atv-bootloader can a) search and find an existing grub menu.lst and auto-boot from it, b) search for a &quot;boot_linux.sh&quot; file and auto-execute it, and c) search for &quot;patchstick.sh&quot; and auto-execute it. The initrd &quot;boot_linux.sh&quot; script currently search sdb then rest of the disk devices (this will be changed in the future once the real boot device can be recovered from the device tree passed by boot.efi).  This procedure allows atv-bootloader to auto-boot a linux install or be extended for other uses. This is controlled by a &quot;Kernel Flag&quot; string param in com.apple.Boot.plist and has the following definitions  #search for mb_boot_tv, grub and syslinux/ioslinux config --auto boot default
<br/>&quot;atv-boot=auto&quot;</p>

<p>#search for a &quot;boot_linux.sh&quot; file and execute it.
<br/>&quot;atv_boot=manual&quot;</p>

<p>#search for a &quot;patchstick.sh&quot; file and execute it.
<br/>&quot;atv_boot=patchstick&quot;</p>

<p>#default is to drop to a login prompt (user=root, password=root)
<br/>atv-bootloader is located here and the source is in svn. Warning SVN trunk is the development branch You will not find any files named atv-bootloader as atv-bootloader is the concepts contained within the downloaded package. This package contains a prebuilt &quot;fake&quot; mach kernel with embedded Linux kernel/initramfs along with the required support files. The only thing required is boot.efi which cannot be distributed. 
<br/>Understanding AppleTV partitions Understanding kexec Software tools The AppleTV needs a specific version of &quot;boot.efi&quot; in order to boot properly. This version can be extracted from the downloadable AppleTV update and this version of dmg2img is used to convert from &quot;dmg&quot; to &quot;img&quot; formats. See the guide on extracting &quot;boot.efi&quot; for information. The AppleTV requires GPT formatted partitions. &quot;parted&quot; can do this but is missing a required GUID format. So you need a patched parted. See the installing parted guide for information. The AppleTV uses two HFS formatted partitions, while the standard Linux distro can mount HFS disk, the ability to format HSF is missing. See the installing HFS tools guide for information. Create a bootable USB flash disk The basic atv-bootloader using a USB flash disk. 
<br/>Backup and Restore If you are installing to the original AppleTV internal drive, you should backup the original hard drive. This section contains a guide for the backup and restore of the internal PATA disk. 
<br/>Installing Linux Install Linux to the internal hard disk or to a external USB hard drive and leave the original AppleTV hardware drive unaltered. Either method is acceptable and will result in a working Linux install.  
<br/>Booting a Linux LiveCD You CAN boot a LiveCD on the AppleTV using a USB cdrom. This guide contains information on how to boot the Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy LiveCD and information for booting other Linux LiveCDs or CD installers. 
<br/>Build a basic patchstick Build a basic patchstick that can install and enable ssh access into the AppleTV OS. 
<br/>Extending patchstick WinXP and friends Trying to do anything involving the AppleTV under Windows is not recommended. Windows does lots of hidden things like touching partitions that is has no business touching. Boot a Linux LiveCD instead and do everything from that environment. SupportUnfortunately, I do not have the time to teach how to use Linux or MythTV but if you have a question or problem with atv-bootloader, getting a Linux distribution installed or tweaks to get the best performance, post it to http://groups.google.com/group/atv-bootloader .  </p>

<p>It helps to indicate the distro and kernel version if you are having run-time problems. Also if you are having problems building a bootable atv-bootloader, include the full output of &quot;sudo parted -s /dev/sdX unit s print&quot; where sdX is the disk device. And completely describe your problem and setup, for example &quot;I&#39;m having problems booting from a USB disk&quot; is just not enough information, Thanks. </p>

<p>FeedbackYou can use this page to post feedback on your experences building and using atv-bootloader. </p>

<p>How can You ContributeIf you want to help, the most pressing item is a deb/rpm that contains dmg2img, patched parted, hfs tools, gptsync. This would eliminate the patch/build steps. Another deb/rpm with pre-compiled usbhid.ko and snd-hda-intel.ko  kernel modules for the various distros would be nice. I&#39;m not experienced in proper deb/rpm creation so if someone could give me a good example, I can take it from there. </p>

<p>Another task for the more experienced person would be to figure out how osputil works and the USB protocol that it uses to talk to the IR USB controller. Once this is known, then I can create a similar Linux command-line app that does the same thing. Then we can control the internal fan and most important, control the white/amber LED on the front of the AppleTV and STOP it from blinking amber all the time. </p>

 summary : <p>EthicalThis isn&#39;t ethical as in, don&#39;t download DRM encumbered music, don&#39;t illegally download copyrighted software, don&#39;t kill baby seals, and only use free (as in speech) codecs.  Other people fight those battles.  This is ethical as in, lets treat the sysadmin ethically, lets treat the users ethically. </p>

<p>SysadminThe sysadmin is an adult, not a mushroom.  They don&#39;t need hand holding, they don&#39;t need things dumbed down, and they don&#39;t need, or want, the details hidden from them.  There is nothing wrong with compiling your own packages or kernels, as long as they are kept in the right place.  An ethical distro allows the sysadmin to do so, and doesn&#39;t complain or create extra hoops. </p>

<p>UserOperating systems aren&#39;t just for sysadmins, in fact, users are often the primary consumer of our cpu cycles!  If a user has the right to write and execute their own code in their own directory, and the sysadmin hasn&#39;t installed a piece of software, the user should be able to install it in their own directory, without undue hassle. </p>

 title : The fluffy-linux-cluster Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What it doesThis software will create a &quot;virtual IP address&quot; shared between two or more machines on the same shared segment (i.e. LAN). TCP-based services running will be automatically load-balanced between the available machines. </p>

<p>No dedicated &quot;load balancer&quot; is required.  </p>

<p>Load-balancingWe do automatic load balancing between all of the available nodes in the cluster. Nodes are automatically discovered and &quot;heartbeat&quot; packets used so that the other nodes know they&#39;re still there. </p>

<p>Fail-overNodes which have failed are automatically taken out of the cluster, i.e. connections will not be sent there. </p>

<p>Other featuresMinimal configuration - just give it an interface and the shared IP address Same configuration on all nodes - no &quot;node ID&quot; or &quot;Cluster ID&quot; to configure per node. Node auto-discovery. No planning required for the number of nodes which will be added in the future. For example, unlike CLUSTERIP, it is not necessary to know how many nodes there are in the cluster. Nodes can be added/removed without downtime. RequirementsLinux 2.6 kernel IPtables, connection tracking, arp tables. Currently a (very small) kernel module is required to change the behaviour of Linux. This is &lt; 50 lines of code. Each node needs to have an IP address on the shared network which the cluster IP address is on. This need not be a public IP address, but routing should really work upstream so that we can send packets out. StatusA functional prototype. Not suitable for production use. </p>

<p>Trying it outCurrently there are no builds. The source code is in svn here. If you intend to try it out, please do so under virtual machines where no harm can be done. Ensure that you use it only on a virtual network, or a network not vital for production use. I can&#39;t guarantee that the network behaviour of this software won&#39;t break your network, even if you use virtual machines :) </p>

 summary : <p>Knights of LinuxSneaky Mogs 8:20 AM Tuesday, June 05, 2007 </p>

<p>Now I know that I am not the best person to be doing this.  I dont plan very well and things just kinda happen to land where ever they may land.  I am not the best person to document my thought process because my thought process never seems to travel in a straight line.  However I have to provide people with an outline as to what I hope to accomplish with the Knights of Linux so here goes. </p>

<p>My BackgroundThis may be the best place to start you on your journey into my head.  I have been working with Linux now for the last - hmmm I guess - 5 years now.  I have used just about all the main stream Linux OSes at one point in time or another, to include - Red Hat (Fedora Core, CentOS, Ubreakable Linux, and XOS included), Suse, Slackware, BSD (FreeBSD, and NetBSD included), and Debian (Ubuntu, and Kubuntu included).  For the most part though I have used Windows - I know booooo, but its the only thing that the jobs I have had have used, and NO I do not run Windows on my computers at home, though my wife does (she aint convinced that Linux is the way yet), I run XOS, Solaris, and the MAC OS on my computers. </p>

<p>Why a need for a new Linux?This question cant be easily answered I dont think.  Like I said earlier I have used just about every mainstream Linux OS on the market.  They have their positives and their negatives.  I prefer XOS at the moment because that is what I am finding works for me.  I know that there are those out there that are &quot;oh use this Linux, or that Linux&quot; but I find that that is the beauty of Linux, you have a choice. </p>

<p>When you have been using the system for a while you probably get it into your head - like I did - that now you need to change some things, tweak them to fit your likes and your comforts.  Sometimes the software you want to use hasnt been ported to your version of Linux - I am talking about you iBuild - and is unavailable for source download due to software restrictions.  Needs that your current OS cant fufill because its not of the same Linux Base (ie...Debian, rPATH, Red Hat, Slackware) as the software that was created.  You have to go looking for the software dependencies. The software dependencies dont install because you dont have the right dependencies for those. </p>

<p>Well that is where the Knights of Linux (KOL) comes in.  (Now I know that there are plenty of OSes out there and I know that this may be seen as just another OS on the market but hear me out.)  KOL is the idea that not all Linux OSes (or All OSes for that matter) need be exclusive to their base, and no software need be rejected. </p>

<p>How do we accomplish this lofty goal?  The concept is to create one OS with many facets - I realise that what I talk about here is not an easy task (it is one that I have been trying to figure out for sometime now) and that many will think me crazy (I very well might be) - an OS capable of bridging the gap between OSes (including closed-source OSes). </p>

<p>I know that I keep mentioning an OS however it is important to remember that the goals of KOL go beyond the OS to the very software that is included with the KOL OS and the very software that is released under the KOL License agreement. </p>

<p>I want us to create an OS that everyone can use (and when I say can I mean will can=will) from the avid &quot;Slackware, have to create my own port, need my own software, my own look and feel&quot; developper, to the &quot;Windows is the best because I can find everything and everything is so easy to use&quot; user. </p>

<p>Knights of Linux OSThe Goal: </p>

<p>Create an OS that has no bounderies.  Includes the needed libraries to install anything, is easily portable, has the goal of building bridges, and is customisable. </p>

<p>The Concept: </p>

<p>At installation the user decides the look and feel of the OS.  Be it a Windows, MAC, Slackware, Red Hat, Suse, BSD, or Debian, look and feel the user will decide.  All the necessary files for that look and feel are installed - as well as all of the libraries (note I didnt say all of the libraries for the look and feel, here I mean ALL of the libraries for the OS no matter the look and feel). </p>

<p>The Software: </p>

<p>Linux Kernel, KDE, Apache, MySQL, php, and Firefox uptodate are requirements for this OS - if you choose to use other software so be it but for the KOL family these are required. </p>

<p>Gnome, X Window, Konquerer, python, perl, and Opera are required options for this OS - once again you may choose to edit this list but these are necessary for it to win the approval of the KOL family tag. </p>

<p>Needed:Developers - to start programming the many facets of this OS, software, or anything else you might think to add :P </p>

<p>Graphics Artists - to design the logos and the look and feel of the OS. </p>

<p>Testers - to test all phases of development. </p>

<p>Marketing Specialist - to sell the idea. </p>

<p>Writers - to write all of this documentation for me. </p>

<p>Software Companies - to hand over source so that we can port their software to KOL (interested in Gaming Companies, and Office Software Companies.)  (OK sorry about that wording - yes I am gonna leave it there - but hand over is probably not the best term to  use if I want to use their source :P if you dont understand why I leave it there then you might not be the best choice for this endeavor.)</p>

<p>Questo lavoro di diploma vuole dare la possibilità allo studente di studiare il funzionamento del sistema operativo Linux da vicino, focalizzandosi sulla parte di rete (Network Layer). Da prima lo studente avrà un periodo iniziale dedicato a farsi un idea (overview) sul funzionamento del Kernel: gestione processi, memoria, scheduling, ecc.. Al termine della quale egli avrà un&#39;idea generale sulla struttura del Kernel e soprattutto sul come la parte di rete si integra nel sistema. In seguito lo studente dovrà approfondire lo studio dello strato di rete. Studiarne la struttura, il funzionamento, l&#39;interazione con il resto del sistema e l&#39;organizzazione dei protocolli principali (ethernet, IP, ARP, RARP, ICMP, TCP e UDP). Una volta compreso lo strato di rete, il compito dello studente sarà quello di sviluppare le aggiunte necessarie, al kernel versione 2.6, che acconsentano il controllo a distanza della macchina. Precisamente si vorrebbe poter aprire una connessione verso il computer &quot;modificato&quot; e collegarsi con privilegi amministrativi. A questo si può aggiungere alcune funzionalità (valore aggiunto) come l&#39;offuscamento della connessione remota (ossia rendere invisibile al utente del computer server la connessione da parte del client) o il controllo del traffico di rete da e verso il server.     </p>

<p>Cose da imparare: </p>

<p>Organizzazione del Kernel Linux Organizzazione del Linux Network Layer Struttura delle componenti principali della parte rete e dei protocolli più usati Come si programma in Kernel Space e le differenze con programmi scritti in User Space Come funziona &quot;a monte&quot; la programmazione di rete e la creazione dei pacchetti. Saper sviluppare software, testare/verificare la correttezza del mio software e quindi integrare la mia parte all&#39;interno di un sistema complesso come il Kernel Testi di riferimento: </p>

 title : The linux-volume-manager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The point of this application is to both simplify and automate the mounting of fuse file systems, as well as the synchronization of directories across multiple systems. I wrote this application because I had what is probably a common problem, I had a desktop with a very large hard disk, and a backup space attached, and I had a laptop with a comaratively small hard disk and no backup space. I wanted to be able to have access to all of the information in a uniform manor. I realized that it would be better to mount some directories/folders directly over sshfs or some other network based file system, while in other cases it would be better to keep the two folders/directories in sync with tools such as rsync.  I searched the web for something that behaved in the way that I wanted it to, but found nothing. Eventually I resolved to write my own implementation.   </p>

<p>Current state of the application: The current release is what I would consider pre alpha, being revision 0.2. It works on my system, but it has very little fault tolerance.  It has two modules one for ftpfs and another for sshfs, I will continue to develop modules for the 0.2 system as i begin work on r0.3.  </p>

<p>Goals for 0.3: Move passwords out of the mappings.list file and into a secure secrets file.  Create a more fault tolerant environment which will test for success and failure and try other methods to gain success.  Get auto mount on net-up working. And implement unmount. </p>

<p>Roadmap: My final goal for this project is to create a proper kde4 application, with a simple ui to mount unmount and sync directories across two or more systems, through combining various fuse file systems, and synchronization tools.</p>

<p>Driver for the wireless card realtek 8187se for kernels 2.6 </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fork of this driver &quot;rtl8187se_linux_26[1].1022.0904.2008_Release.tar.gz&quot; uploaded to forums.msiwind.net by an user. </p>

<p>Check this Installer to automatically download, build and install this driver. Thanks to ctwardy Ubuntu packages available for hardy and intrepid: http://boskastrona.ovh.org/ Changelog0.4 </p>

<p>Fix of the last fix :) Thanks the help of ctwardy </p>

<p>0.3 </p>

<p>Fix building on kernel version prior 2.6.27 </p>

<p>0.2 </p>

<p>All warnings of gcc removed Bugs in r8180_wx_set_auth and r8180_wx_set_gen_ie fixed (affects authentication)   0.1 Fixes in makedrv, makecln. Added install script  New procfs entry /proc/net/rtl8180/wlan0/rf_kill </p>

<p>About RF KILL in RTL8187seIf the wireless device is off (using Fn+F11 with MSI Wind) this file contains 1. In the other case 0. </p>

<p>The original driver uses a tricky method to notify when the wifi is disabled or enabled by the user. A script in this hardcoded path &quot;/etc/acpi/events/RadioPower.sh&quot; with RFOFF or RFON argument is called by the driver when the user activates or deactivates the wifi device using Fn+F11. The problem is, this method only works when the wlan interface is up and polling the hardware continuously with intervals of 1-3 seconds. </p>

<p>How to notify Network ManagerConfigure a shortcut key launching the following python script when the wifi is toggled. It can be done in gnome, kde, xfce using their respective keyboard preferences interface or using other tools as hotkeys. Remember chmod +x the script </p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env python
<br/>import dbus</p>

<p>bus=dbus.SystemBus()</p>

<p>hal_obj =bus.get_object (&#39;org.freedesktop.Hal&#39;, &#39;/org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager&#39;);
<br/>nm_obj  =bus.get_object (&#39;org.freedesktop.NetworkManager&#39;, &#39;/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager&#39;)</p>

<br/>hal     =dbus.Interface (hal_obj, &#39;org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager&#39;)</p>

<p>wifi    =(nmp.Get(&#39;org.freedesktop.NetworkManager&#39;, &#39;WirelessEnabled&#39;)==1)
<br/>rf_kill =(file(&#39;/proc/net/rtl8180/wlan0/rf_kill&#39;).read()[0]==&#39;1&#39;);</p>

<p>if wifi == rf_kill:

 title : The seed-linux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome To Seed LinuxWhen it comes to building tailored servers, nothing beats the flexibility of a source-based distribution like Gentoo Linux.  The ability to build a server to meet your exact needs provides a real competitive edge in business.  The ability to reproduce it over and over again ... that adds real agility to your operations. </p>

<p>Seed Linux provides quality releases that can be used to quickly &#39;seed&#39; a server or workstation for specific purposes.  Seed Linux is built on top of Gentoo Linux. </p>

<p>What Are We About?We&#39;re currently exploring ways to quickly &#39;seed&#39; fully-working copies of Gentoo onto boxes. </p>

<p>Generating these seeds has a couple of purposes: </p>

<p>1. Offering fully configured function-orientated expansions on the official stage3 tarball. </p>

<p>Most people need to configure a standard server or desktop, LAMP is a good example of a server setup. 
<br/>A lot of us are still reinventing the wheel and using different configurations. 
<br/>By offering a pre-configured seed with a collection of tools we planning to provide an example setup. 
<br/>We hope that these seeds will grow into a reference deployment. </p>

<p>2. Create meta-ebuilds for both the package-sets and the associated configurations </p>

<p>This will enable others to choose between using the entire seed, just the packages without the config or their own system setup with the seed&#39;s packages and configuration.  </p>

<p>3. Document the process of generating such a seed and deploying it. </p>

<p>Everyone in a multiple server-maintenance situation needs a repeatable method of generating server setups 
<br/>So far everyone is using his/her own method of generating and deploying these seeds/server-images. 
<br/>Many people have written custom deployment systems. By leveraging existing gentoo tools such as catalyst, overlays, layman and custom profiles, we hope to ease the burden and offer a well-documented way of installing multiple servers with a similar setup. </p>

 title : The solidos-linux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Solidos is a Linux-based operating system that showcases the latest in free and open source software. Solidos is always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. It is built by people across the globe who work together as a community: the Solidos Project. The Solidos Project is open and anyone is welcome to join. </p>

<p>The Solidos Project is out front for you, leading the advancement of free, open software and content.  </p>

<p>We want to create a real alternative to Windows. Not only one that can be used by geeks, but also not one that is so &quot;user-friendly&quot; that annoys power users. We want to make available an operating system that is balanced: Giving beginner users the most user-friendly interface and the easiest way to install programs, and at the same time, offering power users the flexibility they expect from an UNIX®-based operating system. </p>

<p>Solidos is based on Linux (more specifically, the Fedora distribution). Therefore, Solidos is a free, open-source operating system that can be used out of the box by any company, or modified to meet one&#39;s needs. </p>

<p>Our goals for Solidos is: </p>

<p>User friendly interface based on GNOME (with thorough customization) (KDE lovers: it will be included too :-)) Out-of-the-box binary compatibility with Solaris®, FreeBSD®, MS-DOS® and Windows®, as well as .NET and Java runtimes. Offer a solid platform for virtualization (either guest or host) Deliver a thorough set of productivity applications based not on political reasons, but rather based on &quot;What application does task  better?&quot; Provide easy community resources for developers, contributors and users to solve doubts, help each other and improve the system Easy framework for installing applications and maintaining (eg. upgrading) them Providing not only high-quality security (such as antivirus and firewall), but also providing friendly interface for security management Be suitable for both desktop and server environments Offer a state-of-art reliable solution for companies relying on mission critical software</p>

 title : The spoon-linux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The basic idea is to have a system with 3 NIC&#39;s.  Two of the NIC&#39;s will be set in bridge mode and will pass all traffic between them in both directions.  You can then filter traffic on the bridging interface using iptables or pf in BSD.  The third NIC is for management and would have and interface based in PHP to access the box.  Because the bridging interfaces have no IP addresses in them it is impossible to access them using those interfaces.  If you do a trace route the machine will not show up, if you look at the arp table of the switch or router it is connected to, you will see nothing but the other devices that are connected.  So for all intents and purposes the machine doesn&#39;t exist, thats why I called it Spoon Linux because there is no spoon.  The system will be based in gentoo, mainly because its more customizable from the start and I can remove everything except what I need right down to the code level and optimization.</p>

 title : The ubuntutrinux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?Trinux: A Linux Security Toolkit was a ramdisk-based Linux distribution that was under active development from 1998-2003. This new project (i.e. ubuntutrinux) seeks to integrate elements (and code, where appropriate) of Trinux with the Debian/Ubuntu mkinitramfs infrastructure to allow easy development and packaging  Ubuntu binary (and ultimately package and repository) compatible ramdisk distributions using recent 2.6.x kernels. As before, the most common use is network security monitoring and analysis. See this blog entry for more on philosophy and design principles. </p>

<p>Although there might be some overlap in the tools available, this project does not seek to provide a pen-testing distro along the lines of Backtrack or Knoppix-STD . If you are looking for a platform to run Nessus or Metasploit I encourage you to look elsewhere. </p>

 title : The virtex-linux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Virtex-Linux is a Small linux distro, suitable for use on the embedded powerpc-405 processor of the virtex-II FPGA. The XUP-V2P plataform is initially supported. The goal is to build a debian-like system, or to directly use debian repositories. </p>

<p>History: </p>

<p>New 13/4/2009: I have successfuly compiled 2.6.29 kernel using uartlite, xsysace and emaclite drivers with XPS 10.1 sp3. Instructions are here: http://code.google.com/p/virtex-linux/wiki/LinuxV2 </p>

<p>As part of the required courses for my PHD in Computer Science in ITBA (Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires), I spent the second semester of 2007 researching and using the FPGA technology to build custom digital hardware. One of the task that i completed during that period was this small Linux distro, to use it as a little server when I&#39;m not using it in my evil projects (AKA research thesis). </p>

<p>Turns out that the PowerPC 405 that comes with the Virtex II-Pro is not slow at all and can easily run almost all the standard unix applications. I started compiling and installing stuff and made a pretty complete system. It&#39;s still based on Busybox but has a lot of real applications on it, like Python, Vim, Bash, qemu, etc. In the beginning I was cross-compiling but once I got GCC native working on the board, things were much easier. </p>

<p>I have putted together this distro following the steps in the BYU Linux on FPGA page: </p>

<p>http://splish.ee.byu.edu/projects/LinuxFPGA/index.htm </p>

<p>You will need a Compact Flash memory of about 512 Megabytes. </p>

<p>Virtex-linux V 0.1 contains: </p>

<p>Syntethized hardware: </p>

<p>    PowerPC 405 300 Mhz (Just one processor used, can&#39;t use the other one because the board lacks a cache-coherency circuit)     16550 Serial (115200 8n1 default)     100 Megabits Ethernet MAC     System ACE Flash (Up to 4 Gigabytes?, tested with 2 Gigabytes)     512 MB DDR Controller (Works with a bigger 1 GB Dimm but only will see 2 banks, 512 MB) Software: </p>

<p>Montavista Linux kernel 2.4 for ppc (Free edition) BusyBox 1.61 (Fairly complete installation)  OpenSSH 4.6 (Including sftp-server) Bash 3.02 Tor 0.1.2.17 OpenSSL 0.98e  Python 2.5  Vim 7.2  Links browser 2.1pre28 (SSL,ZLIB,JavaScript) Qemu 0.8.2 (Tested running an i386 OpenBSD 4.3 image, works fine!) GCC/G++ 4.02 native (from http://www.kdvelectronics.eu/ml403/ppc405_native_gcc.html) A couple of development libraries: zilb,readline, etc. The final goal is to make this distribution as small as possible, and convert it to use the debian ppc repositories (Hint: The debian etch PowerPC packages work even if the don&#39;t support ppc-405, I installed qemu that way) </p>

 title : The django-morsels Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This app enables admins of a Django site to control the content of text blocks displayed as part of dynamic site templates. </p>

<p>Often, static content is embedded in dynamic templates, making it hard to edit. Using this app, the static content is moved to a morsel, and displayed in the template using a custom template tag. </p>

<p>Morsels are tied to site pages using URL matching, combined with arbitrary names. The use of URL matching means that templates do not have to specify the morsel which is to be used, making it possible to display different morsels when the same template is used to render different site pages. </p>

<p>FeaturesEach morsel can be tied to a site page by specifying the page&#39;s URL in the morsel. Different morsels can be used in the same page by adding arbitrary names to the morsel&#39;s URL. Morsels can be inherited from higher levels in the site&#39;s URL hierarchy. This allows the content of a single morsel to be displayed in a whole site section, while being overriden by other morsels in specific pages within the section. Morsels can include an optional title, which may be used to identify the morsel and may also be displayed in templates using the morsel. Two custom templatetags - morsel and withmorsel - allow morsels to be used in various, flexible ways. Morsels can be locked, which prevents them from being deleted. This is intended to prevent accidental deletion of required morsels. If the typogrify app is installed, morsel content will be typogrified when rendered using the morsel templatetag.</p>

 title : The dynamic-rule-security Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an extension of Spring Security and JBoss Rules ( Drools ) and allows a system to have dynamic rule based security that&#39;s context and request aware. Dynamic rules can restrict access to specific fields, objects, and/or resources or setup custom ACL per field, object, and resource.  </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>Imagine restricting access to a pojo based on the requested objects attributes. </p>

<p>when
<br/>   trade : Trade(traderName == &quot;Jack&quot; &amp;&amp; amount &gt; $50,000,000 )
<br/>then 
<br/>   retract(trade);Imagine restricting access to a field based on the context of the call and the attributes of the requested object! </p>

<p>when 
<br/>   trade : Trade(traderName == &quot;Jack&quot; &amp;&amp; currentUser != &quot;Jack&quot; ) 
<br/>then
<br/>   security.setAcl(&quot;amount&quot;, NONE );
<br/>   security.setAcl(&quot;account&quot;, READ | EDIT );This project allows all the business security rules to be centrally managed, and alleviates the different system tiers from dealing with security. For example, the presentation tier only needs to worry about following the set ACL rather than having business logic that decides what ACL to set.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the general premise of this project is to externalize the security rules from the code. This means the code should be rather free of the security logic. One way to do this is via AOP and annotations. The easiest way to start to use dynamic rules is by annotating your data retriever methods: </p>

<p>@Secure(secureResult=true)
<br/>public Trade getTrade( int tradeId ) {...}AOP is then leveraged to intercept the return value, apply security rules on it, and then return the secured object.  </p>

<p>We also include a JSTL Tag to simplify web development.  </p>

<p>    
<br/>The reason to choose Drools is that it&#39;s a leading Open Source Rule Engine. The reason to choose Spring Security is that it provides a modularized, open implementation of a security framework. The project is not intending to reinvent the wheel with Drools or Spring, but rather build on top of what already exists and is generally accepted.</p>

 title : The ed-oe Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The EOE is an acronym for the &quot;Educational Operating Environment&quot;.  The EOE is both a design-in-progress and is to be an implementation of host-independent, distributed operating environment of software-objects consisting of several categories (or functional super-categories) of software &quot;objects&quot;.  The actual host-independent code is to be constructed initially in JAVA, Java Script, and later in similar host and OS independent programming technologies.  Of course, there is to be no barrier to contributors constructing like-functioned OS-dependent &quot;object&quot; modules from the ever-evolving EOE design.  </p>

<p>The primary purpose of the EOE is to bring the best human-assisted and AI-assisted instruction to students world-wide.  A second purpose is to &quot;work around&quot; the innovation-delaying (or &#39;retarding&#39; or &#39;slowing&#39;) marketing games played by the commercial software industry so that better distance learning applications come to work with each other sooner than their manufacturers&#39; would otherwise allow.  Disadvantaged students in the developed-world and in the developing-world should thereby come to have access to higher quality educational content, tutors, instructors, static and dynamic tutorials and instruction, and have much better educational experiences than the commercial software industry is likely to provide in the so-called &quot;free market&quot; system espoused and practiced in the USA since 1980.  </p>

<p>This investigator calls the &quot;innovation delaying&quot; process &quot;feature-creep&quot;.  This investigator believes it exists so that top management of producers of commercial software can maximize their companies&#39;&quot;return on investment&quot; (ROI), i.e. maximize income and profits gained from the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; (or least-smart-versions) of their software being sold to the most people and organizations, world-wide!  Consequently they gain a great deal more income for the money they spent investing in their particular software&#39;s production and distribution. This model is supposedly a &quot;good thing&quot;, but some would argue otherwise. Suffice to say, the Open Source Model of software design, building, testing, and deployment is changing the 5-decades old proprietary, commercial software model.  </p>

<p>In general, the EOE is to integrate the disparate functions of otherwise heterogeneous distance learning applications (DL or DL apps) as well as of heterogeneous Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS or ITS apps). ITS is an increasingly robust area of Computer Science and more advanced &quot;Educational Technologies&quot;... which used to be called &quot;computer assisted instruction&quot; 25 years ago.  Technically, certain EOE middle-ware software object components will perform the integration. Other EOE middle-ware objects will assess students&#39; activities and performance across ALL integrated DL applications.  Other EOE middle-ware objects will find and &quot;attach&quot; to a student&#39;s live interaction with a DL application the most appropriate ITS application for the student&#39;s subject, lesson-in-subject, and the student&#39;s learning styles and preferences. These are a few of the &quot;added-educational-values&quot; the EOE system is to make available to students. </p>

<p>In general the EOE is intended to (1) &quot;homogenize upwards&quot; the collective best features -- and as many as possible of the collective features -- of categories of like and &quot;slightly&quot; dissimilar distance learning applications integrated by the EOE.  Another way to understand &quot;homogenize upwards&quot; is to find the &quot;highest common denominator&quot; of features within certain functional categories of DL and ITS applications.  Some EOE objects and applications and/or applets and servlets to be designed and coded are to perform that kind of feature assessment. (2) As an &quot;operating environment&quot;, and not an operating system, the EOE is to be able to &quot;talk to&quot; (i.e. interact with and offer educationally-appropriate supervisorial control over) a wide variety of client and server operating systems, adding &quot;educational values&quot; to those OSes and to any EOE-integrated distance learning applications running on them.  Of course, the same control will apply when ITS applications are added to the EOE.  (3) As an &quot;operating environment&quot; and &quot;abstraction&quot; of the functions of the EOE-integrated DL and ITS applications, parts of the EOE will also abstract the functionality and APIs to a variety of RDBMS (and OODBMS) databases that the integrated DL and ITS applications use!  (4) The latter integration and abstraction make possible the gathering throughout the EOE-system, in a systematic and easily changeable way, database-performance information, learning-events information, learning content use information, as well as a variety of OS-vs.-DL application and OS-vs-ITS application performance data.  (5) As in (4), the integration and abstraction of the EOE should make dissemination of process-control and learning-optimization information to appropriate &quot;helper&quot; applications integrated within the EOE!   </p>

<p>(6) The EOE middle-ware objects are intended to integrate and coordinate learning-actities and lesson/course-performance assessment of students&#39; activities with one or more of the distance learning applications of their choice.  (7) As an EOE, the EOE is to appropriately &quot;filter&quot; and reform as-needed (or generate suggestions for the reform of) learning content and for some &quot;less effective&quot; aspects of live and replayed learning-experiences streamed to student users.  The EOE is to do so, eventually, according to each students&#39; current means of client-computer interaction with one or more distance learning applications and the respective course content, live and replayed instruction vended by those DL applications.   </p>

<p>This means the EOE is to eventually be able to compensate for otherwise static web-based course and lesson content, and/or for what this investigator calls &quot;poorly-made, psuedo-dynamic&quot; web content that is the current (2007-2008) trend in &quot;better&quot; web pages and web sites.  The EOE is to archive and play-back text, audio, and video streams and &quot;chats&quot; for otherwise unrecorded instructional streams vended by an EOE-integrated DL application operating independently of the EOE.  In doing so, the EOE is to make up for any such deficiencies existing in the student&#39;s target distance learning applications and web content.  This meta-feature of the EOE makes possible the future dynamic generation of web-learning content (in a future ITS) based on any existing (and archaic) static, one-size-fits-all-students-in-a-class course content, or the just-in-time (JIT) presentation to individual students of learning-materials best suited to their individual learning-style, preferences, as well as past to most-recent learning experience and problems with the given subject-material.  (8) With the integration of AI-based learning process and  control programs and of AI-based ITS into the EOE, an evolving, improving degree of just-in-time (JIT), or just-in-a-reasonable-time (JIRT), live-human-generated tutorial experiences and/or ITS-generated, individualized, tutorial learning content will become possible.   </p>

<p>Some History of The EOE Project:  I, Jennifer Woodward, MA and 63.5 y.o. at this writing in May 2008, began specific development of the EOE concept and the necessary and &quot;sufficient&quot; attributes of the EOE in 1998 upon my completion of the official work period allowed me by a U.S. Dept. of Education grant for 1997-98. I have worked to refine and elaborate upon the concept and the scope of the EOE ever since that time with some financial support from ana-systems, Inc. (www.ana.com, SF, California, and NYC, USA). I have also been working since 2005 to document an evolutionary path or paths for the EOE set of objects.   </p>

<p>Aspiring design contributors please note:  Most or all EOE design and prototype code is to be agreed upon by consensus, super-majority, simple-majority, or plurality vote in the future as circumstances best allow.  </p>

<p>Alpha and Beta Code Testing Ideas:  The original EOE deployment is to be on one, two, then three+ servers which serve very many client computers (and students) learning content and learning experiences delivered to them by way of multiple heterogeneous distance learning applications.  The distance learning applications, existing and emerging commercial and open-source, are to be running on both the students client computers and the server computer(s) as-needed for their better or best education at a specific time on a specific subject for the specific student!  The server computers are to be locatable anywhere in the world with an Internet connection.  The server course content, and some live human-generated instruction delivery, is to be multilingual and -- by the time anything useful gets deployed regarding the EOE -- could also allow for dynamic translation of course materials where such materials are not yet available in the desired language for the student.   </p>

<p>See MIT&#39;s Project Athena client and server model and open code for some details of the inspiration and basis core feature-sets for the EOE model of system-wide EOE c/s maintenance, deployment, upgrading, and course content delivery.   </p>

<p>Some EOE Design Criteria:  The well-formed, well-tested, distributed EOE is intended to evolve to allow scaling of various kinds.   </p>

<p>For example: (1) the evolved EOE finds the best/closest path to proxy servers that use the EOE. EOE proxy servers are to be, in part, intermediate servers which are closest (least number of network &#39;hops&#39; and fastest connectivity) to clusters of users of a given distance learning application in recent live DL application usage history).  EOE proxy servers are to archive text, audio, and/or video streams for replay by students who (a) lost a connection, (b) had a slow or intermittent connection during a live discussion with instructors, or with class-mates, or with a tutor.  The EOE proxy server also (c) is to serve students the best possible bandwidth and learning-content quality for those students who want to review the material recently presented to them.   
<br/>(2) The evolved EOE finds various kinds of distance learning applications according to a student&#39;s individual needs and desires.  It also finds &quot;most appropriate&quot; and &quot;better&quot; courses and lessons, given the student&#39;s archived &quot;competency&quot; and &quot;preferred learning styles&quot; for the learning material to be presented (live or authored or both).   
<br/>It also finds (3) the  best/closest alternative DL application and course content and required course-management servers to, in part, maximize connection speeds to DL applications, to DL course-content, to learning-enhancement servers (i.e. servers that connect to human and AI-assisted tutoring for specific courses and lessons within course that are most appropriate for students with certain cognitive demographics), and to distributed learning-assessment, learning-styles identifying, and learning-history servers.  </p>

<p>SOME KEY TECHNICAL DESIGN GOALS of the EOE are:  1. Create the core distributed client and server EOE meta objects that coordinate all other objects in the EOE system.   </p>

<p>2. Create the core &quot;other objects&quot; that allow the development of the following highest level features of the EOE:  </p>

<p>2.1. Create distributed client/server EOE objects that integrate distance learning applications WITHIN in each of several (5+) categories of distance learning applications.   
<br/>2.2. Create EOE objects that integrate distance learning applications BETWEEN each of several (5+) categories of distance learning applications.  This would be a slightly lower level of &quot;meta-objects&quot; in the EOE design.   
<br/>2.3. Integrate the EOE functionality to individual distance learning applications (commercial or open source) by way of &quot;EOE DLapp Adaptor&quot; code objects. The EOE Adaptor concept is to be an abstraction of the functionality within a given functional category of DL application as well as a generalization of the functionality for specific kinds of DL application, as any differences with other DL applications within their DL category requires.  
<br/>3. Identify, architect, and build prototype Object-Oriented code that enables the creation of &quot;hooks&quot; (learning-events, messaging and data kinds &amp; types between other OO code objects) in turn also enable the integration into the EOE of (artificially, AI) Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS).   </p>

<p>ITS is now a more robust area of research in graduate and post-doctorate level computer science.  However to-date most ITS applications are subject-domain specific and do not &quot;generalize&quot; well to cover disparate, unanticipated, or similar subject areas that might have, say, similar content or pedagogy.  AI and ITS now can be used to offer a small range of both generalized and learning-domain specific AI-assisted human and computer-generated tutorial assistance, where one-set-of-ITS-generated/selected-static-course-content serves all students of the given  course or lesson.   
<br/>ITS can do so now (I assume) with some declining but still large time-delay in the request-response cycle, where that delay is dependent on the complexity of the AI-analysis of the learning situation (or it is dependent upon the time required to search through a database of pre-analyses) and it is dependent upon the serving computer&#39;s power, usually a single server.  ITS will evolve to provide it&#39;s services Just-In-Time (JIT) where the request for individualized content (or for live) instruction deliver and it&#39;s appearance at the student&#39;s client computer lag time approaches 10 to 5 seconds, a time-frame which most users perceive to be a &quot;real-time&quot; response.  It will do so with an expanding range of individualized course and lesson materials (and also with the evolving better parameters and attributes determined within the EOE with which to generate such materials) to better serve the learning desires of students of all ages of an expanding range of courses and lessons delivered world-wide by the EOE-integrated system of distance learning and ITS applications.   
<br/>To enable the development and delivery of categorical and individualized instruction, a kind of META-CONTENT or &quot;cognitive content&quot; markup language needs to be defined for both domain-specific courses and lessons within course as well as for generalizations of various the learning-process and goals involved in a range of learning styles and preferences for students of a wide-range of ages and learning experiences!  </p>

<p>Anticipated Evolution of the EOE Project:  The AI + ITS + DL environment created by the EOE is intended to evolve as code as open source JAVA, SOAP, JINI, and JavaScript code, primarily.  The evolving EOE design and code-base is to continue to be a publicly published, open design that accepts world-wide contributions.  Likewise, the EOE requirements and specifications documentation and the graphic UML designs are all to be stored here.  This investigator hopes the EOE design documentation-base and the EOE code-base (to come soon) will (1) inspire educational end-users to contribute their ideas and suggestions to the goals and EOE design, as they are able, and will (2) inspire a growing number of object-oriented system designers and programmers to undertake further refinement of design-parts of the EOE such that they may be coded and tested both as code-units (single code modules) and as increasingly larger functional sub-sets of the EOE-system.   </p>

<p>Some Design Details:  The EOE design is, in part, to eventually include the computer-assisted educational ideals of: (1) enabling EOE-system-wide ways and means for dynamic assessment of small-group (averaged) learning preferences as well as of individual student&#39;s learning styles and preferences, all data to be kept in a database TBD. (2) Enabling EOE-system-wide ways and means for the automated selection and eventual dynamic generation of individualized-personalized instructional materials as determined. This investigator imagines that at first such alternative materials will be recommended to course and lesson-content authors of alternative content for chosen &quot;small-groups&quot; in a given class.  Selection would be based on evolving student cognitive demographic groups to be determined. Later selection of alternative materials as well as the dynamic generation of alternative materials (JIT) are to happen via the EOE as &quot;the EOE=ITS(es) system&quot; selects the best suited, best tailored materials for individual students, according to their individual learning styles and preferences.  Again, this selection and/or generation will be based on students&#39; past to most-recent learning experiences.    </p>

<p>Thus from initial R1 (release 1) roll-out of the EOE (or some part of it), the EOE will provide (3) the added-educational-value features of allowing a student to make dynamic just-in-time (JIT, such as 5-10 seconds for response-sent, requested-content-received) connections, or just in a reasonable time (JIRT, such as 1-2 minutes).  The EOE and it&#39;s integrated DL and ITS apps will do then provide appropriate lesson-in-progress tutoring by connecting the student with (a) appropriate, vetted, well-supervised on-line human tutor, and/or with (b)the appropriate ITS applications for the subject-matter, student&#39;s learning style, and preferences vis-a-vie the subject matter -- and the student&#39;s history with such material.  Human tutors will be previously well-vetted &quot;by a part of the EOE system&quot; to be developed in a Second Phase to be defined &quot;soon&quot;.  Tutor vetting, a kind of expanded, more security-rich &quot;social networking&quot;, will insure tutors&#39; subject-matter expertise and pedagogical qualifications and experience, their character, and of course track their availability dynamically.  Vetted tutors will also be monitored in their tutorial efforts by participating within the EOE-system.  They will be monitored to determine their consistent or varying on-going quality of their class and tutorial instructions, to insure they are maintaining their qualifications and character appropriate for interaction with students of various ages, as well as to insure that subject material they presented (in a particular language) to students (of a given culture or sub-culture) is appropriate for their individual cognitive backgrounds, abilities, and learning experiences. </p>

<p>TOO BIG AN IDEA?  OH YES!!! But so what?  And why not?   This kind of global, or globalizable, learning system WILL EVOLVE sooner or later within the commercial computer software industry, within the larger (F500, F1000) companies, and between systems developers and the larger educational institutions that can fund “consortium” software design and construction projects that would lead into the EOE!  These learning systems of the historically “big players” will evolve with or without the help of commercial software manufacturers and vendors of distance learning applications!   </p>

<p>But open source design and development of such a large system as the EOE could become has the potential to eclipse such “big player” big-projects.  In this investigator&#39;s opinion, there is no time like the present to start thinking about an EOE, the goals and objectives outlined above – and your suggested revisions of them -- and start thinking about the documentation (to be) on-file here.  So PLEASE share your thoughts, ideas, and any design-contributions to the achievement of these ambitious goals and objectives here that could benefit students of all-ages world-wide!  :-)   </p>

FFTempl was tested using Apache 2 on Linux, I have no idea if and how it works under different servers / OSes (it probably won&#39;t without some tweaking because it uses the command os.getenv(&#39;QUERY_STRING&#39;) to get the URL parameters from Apache).  </p>

 title : The google-checkout-mendoza Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main purpose of this utility is to test a Google Checkout API Integration level 2 implementation. </p>

<p>When implementing the Checkout API either using your homemade e-commerce application or an off-the-shelf one (opensource or commercial) you must be sure that everything is working properly. Therefore testing is important. </p>

<p>No matter how you are implementing the checkout API, when testing you will face a well known problem: confronted with the difficulties of testing synchronous and asynchronous http messages, plus &#39;manually&#39; going through the Checkout UI to start testing your own end to end functional test scenarios. </p>

<p>A good idea would be to &#39;automate&#39; as much as we can. This way we can sit and work increasing the coverage of the test cases instead of repeating manual operations. </p>

<p>What if we just add something between the e-commerce application and Checkout to easy the burden of manual testing integration? </p>

<p>This is what Mendoza is: it provides a java server that lives between a shopping cart and Google Checkout, intercepting all web services messages and using Selenium to interact automatically with the Google Checkout UI to implment test scenarios. Mendoza can be used to test shopping carts written in any languages. </p>

 title : The jrfonseca Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Over the years I have developed a wide range of scripts and utilities, ranging from the casual hack to the daily life-saver.  The scripts are usually written in Python language or Bash shell language.  Although originally written for selfish reasons, they can be useful to others, or at least serve as a starting point better than starting from scratch.  They are not that elaborate to warrant a separate project for each, but as a whole  I believe they deserve to be properly hosted, documented and versioned, in order to be more useful to others.  Hence this umbrella project. </p>

<p>Reference Documentation is now also available. </p>

<p>Feature OverviewWritten in Python, distributed as a normal Python package. &quot;Do what I want&quot; semantics:  To create a table, insert data.  To add a column, update data.  To remove a column, update all its values to &#39;None&#39;.  Put any data type in any column.  Querying a non-existant column returns None.  Querying a non-existant table returns 0 rows.  No more schema migration problems! Automatically creates indexes based on past queries, drops indexes when they are no longer in use.  Indexes can also be manually created/frozen.   Robust relational query engine with joins/aggregate functions.  Optimized to return large result sets from queries. Queries are specified as Python dictionaries/lists or JSON; easily manipulate queries as data structures. No reserved words, disallowed characters, or quoting issues.  Any unicode string can be a table or column name. Can be embedded in Python apps or hosted in any WSGI-compliant web server. Communicate via open standards: JSON over HTTP. Simple, clean, secure: User-friendly API. No embedded programming languages; keep your data in your database and your code in one place. StatusCurrently Kineta is not ready for general use.  The code is coming together well and is very usable, but a couple major things still need to be implemented.  Thanks for your interest and check back here for updates.</p>

 title : The lotuscore Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project has been moved to: http://lotuscore.sourceforge.net</p>
 summary : <p>This project is to develop and document the  MicroContentObjectModel XML scheme to express a basic model for snippets of micro content found on the internet. It is very basic and simple to use. </p>

<p>The MicroContentObjectModel (MCOM) describes single inline elements of content in their respective context. Every valid URL and/or DOM object is wrapped into an XML-desription which then can be handled in common programming languages or applications. Initially an MCO &#39;saves&#39; informaton about the context in which it was found, along with a micro content copy in CDATA section.  
<br/>Developer may benefit from using MCOM objects in building websites by nesting related objects. End users  will benefit in better, more comfortable search results which are sensitive to context and semantics. Creatives may find it a way to build peer to peer networks made of content items from various sources.  
<br/>There is no special code or programming language except usage of XML schemes. MCOM is based on and &#39;compatible&#39; with common object models like DOM and MVC. It may be used along with common scripting languages like PHP and Javascript. 
<br/>A sample implementation of MCOM is BlooGee0.0f (project page  https://sourceforge.net/projects/bloogee/). Source code and CVS on http://bloogee.cvs.sourceforge.net/bloogee/BlooGee/ . A presentation is at http://docs.google.com/Present?revision=_latest&amp;fs=true&amp;docID=dhfz8pq8_29dq2skkgz. </p>

<p>This document describes the first version of the Micro Content Onject Model and an abstract class lib MicroContentObject (MCO). It is intended as a paper for thinking about, discussing and using an appropiate model to handle microcontent. This approach does not use keywords to find and glue related pieces of microcontent, it merely focusses - beyond computing relvancy from matching strings on web pages - on the fact that content preferably is linked to &quot;real world&quot; related content and applications, driven by criteria and ideas which are as individual as the context a collection of microcontent represents. Implementing MCOM should benefit the programmer as well as the user by accessing content and appropiate context in one convenient model. </p>

<p>If you are in a hurry, just have a look on the  class code. You will find an MicroContentObject with some properties and three basic methods. The MCO-Model (see MicroContentObjectModel)closely corresponds to the DOM and MVC. Objects may be constructed in (at least) any web-orientated OOP-style programming language on client and server (this document uses &quot;quasi&quot; JavaScript/PHP).</p>

 title : The mywhirlpool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My Whirlpool iGoogle Gadget </p>

<p>Whirlpool.net.au is a fully independent, non-commercial, community website, run by a team of unpaid volunteers, which is devoted to keeping the public informed about the state of broadband in Australia. </p>

<p>This iGoogle Gadget will access and monitor your Whirlpool User Account Whims, Contacts and Monitor Forums by Keywords. The Gadget provides an alert when your Whim Inbox has unread messages and Monitored Forums have new replies or threads. </p>

<p>The &#39;monitor&#39; forums functionality is built on the Unofficial Whirlpool RSS Feeds functionality.  In the gadget preferences you set which forums you want to monitor AND the Keywords you want to monitor.  Only threads which are in the forums being monitored with any of the keywords in the thread&#39;s title are listed. </p>

<p>Settings</p>

<p>Your API Key  Your Whirlpool API Key for external access without a passsword (obtained from, your Whirlpool User Account).  Note that you must also set API access &#39;Mode&#39; to &#39;Enable&#39; in your user account settings.   Ignore Deleted Threads  Set flag to hide deleted threads and threads moved to a different forum.   Group by Forum  List each monitored forum and the returned (monitored by keyword) threads as a sub list under the forum header, hence even forums with no threads matching the keywords are still listed.   Monitor Forum #  Multi value list of forums numbers to monitor. For example:    35      (for Forum Feedback)    9       (for Networking)    9&amp;g=3   (for Networking - Wireless)    9&amp;g=-1  (for Networking - Ungrouped)   Monitor Keyword(s)  Multi value list of keywords to monitor in thread titles (case ignored). You must have at least one keyword, having no keywords does not return all threads in the monitored forum(s).  For example:    802.11      (to return threads with 802.11 in the title)    wpa key       (to return threads with both wpa and key in the title)   Ignore Thread(s)  Multi value list of thread numbers to ignore (useful to ignore sticky threads where they contain a keyword). Enter the thread number, for example: 12345 </p>

<p>Known limitationsThere is no functionality to display User&#39;s Subscriptions/Watch List, this is dependant (and waiting) on Simon or Phil creating external access for Subscriptions/Watch List (Refer &amp;nbsp;Issue 1&amp;nbsp;).  The new API under development by Simon adds &#39;Watch&#39;, I will update the gadget when the API is deemed sufficiently stable.</p>
