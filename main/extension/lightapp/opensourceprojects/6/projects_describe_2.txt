 title : The netlib-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Netlib is a collection of mission-critical software components for linear algebra systems (i.e. working with vectors or matrices). Netlib libraries are written in C, Fortran or optimised assembly code. A Java translation has been provided by the F2J project but it does not take advantage of optimised system libraries. </p>

<p>The Matrix Toolkits for Java project provides a higher level API and is recommended for programmers who do not specifically require a low level Netlib API. </p>

<p>This project provides a wrapper layer that gives Java programmers access to a common API which can be configured to use either the pure Java or natively optimised implementations of BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK such as </p>

<p>Intel&#39;s Math Kernel Library AMD&#39;s Core Math Libary Apple&#39;s vecLib Framework the popular open source ATLAS. This ensures perfect portability, while allowing for improved performance in a production environment. Users are advised to perform the appropriate performance profiling with Java and native implementations... the pure Java implementation is surprisingly fast. A good rule of thumb is that native libs only out-perform the Java implementation if specific hardware is used or matrices are larger than 1000 x 1000 elements. </p>

<p>To use this library in your Java projects, you must add the following jar files to your classpath:- </p>

<p>netlib-java-X.jar arpack_combined_all.jar from jarpack (a version comes bundled with netlib-java named arpack-combo-X.jar, in the folder lib/f2j) If you wish to use the JNI, then you may find the necessary source files in the folder jni. You should be able to run the script configure and then make to produce the necessary JNI library files for your system. You will need to have the headers for BLAS and LAPACK on your system, a C compiler and a Fortran compiler (in order to build ARPACK). </p>

<p>Most of the code in netlib-java is autogenerated. If you wish to regenerate the files yourself from the source, you will need to grab the jlapack-0.8-javadoc.zip javadoc file from jlapack-0.8 and place it into the lib/f2j directory.</p>

 summary : <p>Plural is a sound modular typestate checking tool for Java that employs fractional permissions to allow flexible aliasing control.  Plural supports synchronized blocks and atomic blocks for checking concurrent programs.  Typestates can be used to define object protocols with finite state machines; Plural&#39;s protocols can involve multiple interacting objects.  Plural is developed by Nels Beckman and Kevin Bierhoff at Carnegie Mellon University based on their papers published together with Jonathan Aldrich at OOPSLA 2007 and 2008 and elsewhere. </p>

<p>The tool is an Eclipse plugin that relies on the Crystal static analysis framework.  It also uses the Antlr parser generator, which is released under the BSD license. Some Plural test code comes from the Jgroups project, which is released under the LPGL v2.1 license. </p>

<p>Latest NewsWe&#39;ve added a screen capture demo of Sync-or-Swim to Vimeo here. This has the added benefit of actually having readable text. (Use HD, and watch in fullscreen mode.) There is now a demo of Plural on YouTube. As part of Kevin&#39;s Thesis, a screen capture, with audio, was recorded. You can check it out here. The &quot;Fiddle&quot; object protocol visualization no longer depends on any outside plug-ins, so it should be much easier to install. There will be an updated pushed out soon. We wrote a paper on Plural&#39;s internals and in particular, how it tracks permissions in Java.  Check it out! We changed the update site URL to avoid confusion with the Crystal update site, see Installation. A new wiki page, on GettingStarted should help the new PLURAL user. Please post any questions as comments to this page, and we&#39;ll get back to you ASAP! We have finally posted the PLURAL annotations which are needed to run our analysis. Find out more on the Annotations page. Nels has posted a series of NIMBY examples that are in the PLURAL test project and discussed on this page.

 title : The splunk-java-sdk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a library with source code and examples written in Java for coding against the Splunk Platform APIs. </p>

<p>More information on coding against Splunk is hosted over on the Splunk Labs pages at: http://code.google.com/p/splunk-labs/ </p>

<p>Splunk Java SDKSplunk&#39;s Java SDK is a public domain library providing Java development wrapper for projects based around Splunk&#39;s search engine.  </p>

<p>Please note this an early beta release of the SDK, and as such, hasn&#39;t been throughly tested.  If you find any bugs, or need assistance feel free to leave a comment on the Splunk Labs list, opening a ticket, or check out the code yourself and get busy!  Note: Don&#39;t email Splunk directly about support for this library - your requests will go unanswered if you do. </p>

<p>IntroductionSplunk Java SDK is a wrapper around Splunk&#39;s REST API, providing an object model for the major functional components of the Splunk server.  </p>

<p>There are many levels of possible Splunk integration, so we provided developers the ability to communicate with the Platform API - from raw http streaming to custom-tailored objects and SQL-style components. </p>

<p>RequirementsTo run the Splunk Java SDK Library you will need the Java runtime library installed: </p>

<p>Java Platform Standard Edition 5.0 - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp </p>

<p>Installation  Splunk Java SDK is a jar library. You can download the latest version here. </p>

<p>Launch your favorite Java development IDE.  Create a new project.  Import Splunk SDK library to the list of project&#39;s referenced libraries. </p>

<p>DocumentationJavadoc for the project can be found here.  More documentation will be added soon. </p>

 title : The vitoolkitforjava Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>VI Toolkit for JavaThe VI Toolkit for Java is a Java library that is patterned after the VI Perl Toolkit. It makes connecting to VI, finding a VM, and getting its properties a snap! The toolkit is written in Java 6 (1.6). This toolkit uses the  Apache Commons CLI library for parsing command line options and their arguments.  Administrators and developers who like the ability to quickly create scripts with the VI Perl Toolkit but appreciate the depth of Java will love the VI Toolkit for Java.. </p>

<p>Note The VI Toolkit for Java is not the same as the experimental Java client libraries that VMware engineer Steve Jin released on May 8th. Steve&#39;s libraries are brilliant, and I hope to collaborate with VMware by combining our efforts. </p>

<p>Note There is also a VI Toolkit for .NET. </p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>FAQDoes the toolkit only work for command line applications? No. The toolkit library can be used for any Java application. The only requirement is that when you create the toolkit&#39;s Session object, you must pass in options and arguments in the form of a string array, like they would exist from a command line. Alternatively, like the VI Perl Toolkit, most options have corresponding environment variable names that they can read. I&#39;m getting all sorts of exceptions when running the unit tests. Can you help? The UnitTests project requires a properties file. We have not committed ours because it contains sensitive information, such as VI logon credentials. Just add a properties file called UnitTests.properites to the conf directory that looks like this (replace with appropriate values for your site): com.lostcreations.vitoolkitforjava.server=SERVER
<br/>com.lostcreations.vitoolkitforjava.username=USERNAME
<br/>com.lostcreations.vitoolkitforjava.password=PASSWORD
<br/>com.lostcreations.vitoolkitforjava.vm=DNS_NAME_OF_VMWhat assemblies does the VI Toolkit for Java depend on? If any? Aside from what comes with the Java 6 (1.6) Framework, the VI Toolkit for Java depends on the Apache Commons CLI library. The toolkit also depends on the VI SDK classes generated from the VI WSDLs. All of the dependencies the toolkit needs should be in the downloadable tarball.  What is a FatJar? Typically a Java library&#39;s classes are jarred up into a small file and its dependencies reside in a side-by-side directory called lib. A FatJar is a jar file where a library&#39;s dependencies are unjarred and then rejarred into the same jar file as the library. For example, the FatJar file for the VI Toolkit for Java includes all of the Axis class files, VMware class files, and other class files used by the toolkit. So, you don&#39;t support Java 5? No, and the reason why is that Java 6 includes better support for command line input/output. DocumentationDocumentation for the VI Toolkit for Java. </p>

<p>Subroutine ReferenceFor a complete listing of all the toolkit&#39;s subroutines please see this project&#39;s Javadocs. </p>

<p>Default OptionsThe following options are created by default by the toolkit when a Session object is instantiated: </p>

<p>Option  Has Argument  Variable  Default Value  Description   --help  No    Display usage information for the program   --ignoresslerrors  No  VI_IGNORESSLERRORS  False  Ignore certificate mismatch errors   --password   Yes  VI_PASSWORD    Password   --portnumber  Yes  VI_PORTNUMBER    Port used to connect to server   --protocol   Yes  VI_PROTOCOL  https  Protocol used to connect to server   --savesessionfile  Yes  VI_SAVESESSIONFILE    File to save session ID/cookie to utilize   --server  Yes  VI_SERVER  &#39;localhost&quot;  VI server to connect to. Required if url is not present   --servicepath  Yes  VI_SERVICEPATH  &quot;/sdk/webService&quot;  Service path used to connect to server   --sessionfile  Yes  VI_SESSIONFILE    File containing session ID/cookie to utilize   --url  Yes  VI_URL    VI SDK URL to connect to. Required if server is not present   --username  Yes  VI_USERNAME    Username   --verbose  Yes  VI_VERBOSE    Display additional debugging information   --version  Yes      Display version information for the script  </p>

<p>OverviewWebby is a little Web toolkit for Java. Webby&#39;s goal is to enable you to build clean Web apps with minimal fuss. It emphasizes a Web-friendly API, a Rails-ish dispatch framework enabling pretty URLs, and Java-based configuration. </p>

<p>Webby is integrated with Jetty (a nice, fast Web server written in Java) and FreeMarker (a simple, generic template language), but also works with traditional Java webapps and servlet containers, such as Tomcat, as well as JSP. </p>

<p>ResourcesQuickStart ReferenceGuide FAQ Bamboo Build Monkey Start PackagesTo get a basic Tomcat+JSP application going, simply: </p>

<p>svn export http://webby-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/start/tomcatjsp myprojectThis will check out the template project in a new directory called myproject </p>

<p>You can build and run the app like so: </p>

<p>mvn jetty:runNow browse to http://localhost:8080/ </p>

<p>Other templates will be provided over time. And maybe I&#39;ll turn these into Maven archetypes. </p>

 title : The cmdln Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>cmdln.py fixes some of the design flaws in cmd.py and takes advantage of new Python stdlib modules (e.g. optparse) so that it is more useful (and convenient) for implementing command-line scripts/shells. </p>

<p>The main differences are: </p>

<p>Instead of passing a command line to subcommand handlers, already parsed options and an args list are provided. This is much more convenient when the complexity of commands grows to have options, arguments with spaces, etc. By default the help for a subcommand is the associated method&#39;s docstring. Default help output is also much nicer and some template vars can be used to automatically fill in some details. Defining command aliases is easy (using a new decorator). A .main() method is provided to make using your Cmdln subclass a little cleaner. The error handling (and associated hooks) have been improved so that trapping and dealing with errors in sub-command handlers (the do_* methods) can be done -- as might be wanted for a slighty more robust shell. Introductioncmdln.py is an extension of Python&#39;s default cmd.py module that provides &quot;a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters&quot;.  The idea (with both cmd.py and cmdln.py) is to be able to quickly build multi-sub-command tools (think cvs or svn) and/or simple interactive shells (think gdb or pdb).  cmdln.py&#39;s extensions make it more natural to write sub-commands, integrate optparse for simple option processing, and make having good command documentation easier. </p>

<p>For example, here is most of the scaffolding for the svn status command. (Note: Some options were removed and the doc string truncated for brevity. See examples/svn.py for a more complete scaffold re-implementation of the svn command-line interface.) </p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env python
<br/>import sys
<br/>import cmdln</p>

<p>class MySVN(cmdln.Cmdln):
<br/>    name = &quot;svn&quot;</p>

<p>    @cmdln.alias(&quot;stat&quot;, &quot;st&quot;)
<br/>    @cmdln.option(&quot;-u&quot;, &quot;--show-updates&quot;, action=&quot;store_true&quot;,
<br/>                  help=&quot;display update information&quot;)
<br/>    @cmdln.option(&quot;-v&quot;, &quot;--verbose&quot;, action=&quot;store_true&quot;,
<br/>                  help=&quot;print extra information&quot;)
<br/>    def do_status(self, subcmd, opts, *paths):
<br/>        &quot;&quot;&quot;${cmd_name}: print the status of working copy files and directories</p>

<p>        ${cmd_usage}
<br/>        ${cmd_option_list}
<br/>        &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>        print &quot;&#39;svn %s&#39; opts:  %s&quot; % (subcmd, opts)
<br/>        print &quot;&#39;svn %s&#39; paths: %s&quot; % (subcmd, paths)</p>

<p>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
<br/>    svn = MySVN()
<br/>    sys.exit(svn.main())The base cmdln.Cmdln class is providing a number of things for free here. (1) There is a reasonable default help string: </p>

<p>$ python svn.py
<br/>Usage:
<br/>    svn COMMAND [ARGS...]
<br/>    svn help COMMAND</p>

<p>commands:
<br/>    help (?)            give detailed help on a specific command
<br/>    status (st, stat)   print the status of working copy files and dire...(2) A default help command is provided for getting detailed help on specific sub-commands. This is how many such tools already work (e.g. svn and p4, the command-line interface for the Perforce source control system). </p>

<p>$ python svn.py help status
<br/>status (stat, st): print the status of working copy files and directories.</p>

<p>Usage:
<br/>    svn status [PATHS...]</p>

<p>Options:
<br/>    -h, --help          show this help message and exit
<br/>    -v, --verbose       print extra information
<br/>    -u, --show-updates  display update information(3) It makes parsing the command line easy (with optparse integration): </p>

<p>$ python svn.py status -v foo bar baz
<br/>&#39;svn status&#39; opts:  {&#39;show_updates&#39;: None, &#39;verbose&#39;: True}
<br/>&#39;svn status&#39; paths: (&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;)and (4) defining command aliases easy: </p>

<p>$ python svn.py st -v foo bar baz
<br/>&#39;svn st&#39; opts:  {&#39;show_updates&#39;: None, &#39;verbose&#39;: True}
<br/>&#39;svn st&#39; paths: (&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;)Read the GettingStarted page next.</p>

 summary : <p>NOTE: A serious bug has slipped to the latest release and thus that release has been deprecated. I will be releasing a new version as soon as I&#39;ve done enough testing. 2009-04-15: Unfortunately, the release has been postponed again and again ... and again. Sorry about that! However, you can already get the latest version from the SVN and compile Colligere yourself. </p>

<p>Note to self: A simple dynamic homepage for Colligere would a bit more suitable for news&#39;n&#39;stuff. </p>

<p>About The ProjectColligere is an open-source music collection manager for CDs, vinyls, cassettes etc. It&#39;s still under development and already has features like: </p>

<p>Database exporting to XML Importing from OrangeCD-, CATraxx- and Colligere XML-documents Importing from Discogs.com FreeDb disc ID search Discogs release search Database compression Searching with optional support for regular expressions Drag and drop opening Internationalization (currently only Finnish translation is provided) Please note that even though the application is fairly stable, I wouldn&#39;t yet recommend it for daily use. This is because there can be some big changes between versions and these changes could break compatibility with older versions. </p>

<p>Screenshots </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Supported PlatformsSince Colligere uses wxWidgets and other portable libraries, it should basically run on many different operating systems like GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. However, only Win32 binaries are currently provided. For Linux, Mac OS X and such, you can use Wine or better yet, help me in getting Colligere to compile under different platforms! ;) </p>

<p>Latest Change LogThe latest change log can be found from the subversion repository. Note that if the changes are under the title &quot;Colligere 0.xx&quot; it means that those changes will come out in the next release. </p>

 summary : <p>EDEN: Electron DENsity holographic refinementAuthorsEden is written by Hanna and Abraham Szöke. </p>

<p>Current Stable Versioneden-5.3 </p>

<p>What is Eden?Eden is crystallographic real-space electron-density refinement and optimization program that produces electron density maps with minimal model bias in a robust manner. </p>

<p>This program improves macromolecular crystallographic electron density maps in a maximally unbiased manner.  There are now two versions of eden, &quot;seden&quot; and &quot;deden.&quot; seden is compiled with single-precision fftw libs, and is faster and less memory-intensive. deden is double- precision and is possibly more accurate (but in practice the differences appear insignificant). ieden is a new python Tkinter-based GUI. Type &quot;eden&quot; or &quot;seden&quot; to invoke single-precision eden, &quot;ieden&quot; for the GUI, and &quot;deden&quot; for double-precision eden. GUI users need to define the environment variable EDITOR, eg: export EDITOR=&#39;see&#39; or setenv EDITOR vim. </p>

<p>Quick LinksThe Eden Home Page. (This page is currently off-line). </p>

<p>I have an Eden Quick Start page. This gives an example of how to use Eden to make a minimally biased electron density map given a set of coordinates and a set of Fobs. </p>

<p>My Eden on OS X page. </p>

<p>How to Install EdenEden should compile and run on any unix or linux platform (linux, sgi, osx, etc). It has no configure (yet) so you have to edit the makefile.  It needs gsl and fftw2 to compile, and prefers to have grace (xmgr), tk, and python present at runtime. It is primarily a command-line program, but now has a primitive tkinter gui. </p>

<p>Linux PackagesDebian Linux package (i386-ubuntu)http://diablo.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/debian/deb/eden-5.3-2_i386.deb </p>

<p>Gentoo LinuxTo install Eden on Gentoo Linux, do this: </p>

<p>emerge eden </p>

<p>RH/Fedora rpm(converted from above with alien) </p>

<p>http://diablo.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/debian/rpm/eden-5.3-2.i386.rpm </p>

<p>Mac OS X PackageUsing the Fink package manager on OS XEden is available as a package in Fink and by far the easiest thing to do is to issue the command </p>

<p>fink install eden 
<br/>and it takes about two minutes to compile, and everything is set up for you.  Issue </p>

<p>fink describe eden 
<br/>for additional details. </p>

<p>Manual InstallThis is OS X specific, but completely generalizable. </p>

<p>1. l Download Eden from the Eden GoogleCode website, and put the tar file into /usr/local/eden (or your favorite equivalent). </p>

<p>2. Unpack the tar file and read the README_FIRST file. Install fftw2, gsl and grace if you don&#39;t have these already (which is why doing all this with fink makes more sense.) </p>

<p>3. Edit the Makefile to include the following: </p>

<p>libs=-L/sw/lib -lfftw -lm 
<br/>opt=-O3 
<br/>CC=cc 
<br/>(Use the -L/path(s) to wherever your fftw2 and gsl libraries are.) </p>

<p>4. Make other suggested edits to the Makefile, including: </p>

<p>mv eden /usr/local/bin/eden     
<br/>5. Issue the command </p>

<p>export EDENHOME=/usr/local/eden 
<br/>if you use a Bourne-like shell, or </p>

<p>setenv EDENHOME /usr/local/eden   
<br/>if you use tcsh.  Put the relevant command into the relevant startup file. Then to build the program, issue the commands </p>

<p>cd $EDENHOME/source 
<br/>sudo make  (or run make after becoming root).</p>

 title : The flaimo-php Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My collection of PHP classes. At the moment contains following classes: </p>

<p>iCalendarClasses for generating iCal-files. </p>

<p>i18nClasses for internationalization. Mainly for translating strings. Translationstrings can be stored in different backends (like MySQL, Text, …). Since there is an interface you can create your own backend too. Further there are methods for converting measurements, currencies and numbers. </p>

<p>vCardClasses for generating vCard-files. </p>

<p>CacheSimple class for caching strings. </p>

<p>RSS BuilderClasses for generating RSS-feeds. Support for different versions. Output can be saved for caching. </p>

<p>Atom BuilderSame purpose as the RSS Builder only for creating Atom-feeds. In general I would use the Atom format since it&#39;s implementation is much cleaner and done after the specs. The RSS Builder classes were build by reverse engineering RSS files. </p>

<p>ReloadPreventerSmall class which creates tokens to check if a form has been submitted more than once (i.e. by hitting F5 in a Browser to reload the page). </p>

<p>ThumbnailThese classes can generate thumbnails of images and cache the smaller versions. Also you can use other small image as watermarks to place them over the original picture. Further you can create a contact sheet for a whole folder with pictures. </p>

<p>MCryptClass for encrypting and decrypting strings with PHPs MCrypt functions. </p>

<p>DocumentationSince I&#39;m a lazy bone, there is not much documentation for the classes. All of the downloads contain example-files which are documented inline and use all of the functionality of the classes. You should be able to understand how it works by looking at those files.</p>

 summary : <p>Credit This app would not have been possible without the generous help of NetMage, who showed me how to control the brightness. </p>

<p>Description Really, you want a description?  Well, ok: Flashlight flips your iPhone&#39;s brightness up to full, and displays a full screen white rectangle. Slide your finger up and down to change brightness.  Double tap exits.  On exit, your user settings for brightness are restored (well, autobrightness might not work perfectly). </p>

<p>Disclaimer You should be aware of one more thing though: this is obviously a hack, and probably goes beyond what will ever be a part of any public API.  It has also NOT yet been tested (to my knowledge) on the iPod touch. </p>

<p>As such, it does contain the potential to completely destroy your iPhone or iPod touch.  It might even cause a fire, or some other sort of horrible damage.  There&#39;s no warranty of ANY kind included with this app.  Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>NewsApr. 8/08 - And yes, I&#39;ve had my head in the sand for far too long.  Seems that project Pwnage has finally come to fruition.  Congrats guys!  Looks like I won&#39;t need to maintain jailbreaking/SIM unlocking in iNdependence anymore. :) </p>

<p>Apr. 8/08 - Yes, it&#39;s been far too long and I&#39;ve been far too busy...  Regardless, iNdependence 1.4 (final) is finally out.  Not too many changes in this release, but it&#39;s compatible with iTunes 7.6.2, has Danish localization, and it should jailbreak the iPod Touch again.  One major note is that I&#39;ve revamped the MobileDevice framework hookup code to do proper (binary) searches for the private functions.  This should alleviate all problems with figuring out when iTunes updates break things or not and generally make things easier going forward.  Check the CHANGELOG for more details. </p>

<p>NOTE: If you have installed the iPhone SDK, then you won&#39;t be able to use iNdependence to jailbreak or SIM unlock.  It will give you a message telling you how to fix this problem when it starts up. 
<br/>Mar. 7/08 - So the iPhone SDK is out.  Had a chance to play around with it a bit and it looks great (for the future).  However, it&#39;s useless for developing for current phones (1.1.4 or lower) since it&#39;s all based on iPhone software version 2.0.  Still might try a few things to see if I can&#39;t get it to link against the 1.1.4 frameworks... </p>

<p>Feb. 28/08 - I&#39;ve started a list of websites which are distributing binary versions of iNdependence as part of their SIM unlocking solutions, but not making the source code publicly available.  If you know of any others, submit them to the list on the GPLViolators wiki page. </p>

<p>Feb. 28/08 - Some people have been asking about downgrading the bootloader so that they can use the latest versions of the baseband SIM unlocked.  I do not feel comfortable downgrading the bootloader from iNdependence because, if things go wrong, you will end up with a permanently bricked phone.  I&#39;d rather have people missing out on the Google Maps Locate Me feature than risk having that happen to people. </p>

<p>Feb. 14/08 - Lots of great feedback and helpful information is rolling into the Beta14KnownIssues wiki page. </p>

<p>NotesThis program is not tested with the iPod Touch (though there are reports that it has worked) A Call To iPhone Application DevelopersI understand that Installer.app/AppTapp/AppSnapp makes installing/uninstalling applications and their related dependencies easier.  However, I urge developers to also make standalone versions of their apps downloadable from somewhere.  Many people simply want to install one or two applications by hand without having to install a package management system to do that (myself included in that group).  So please consider this type of user as well when you are releasing your applications. </p>

<p>DonationsSome people have asked about donating in appreciation for this software.  Although it is not required, if you would like to donate something, you can send it via PayPal to operator@dialectro.com </p>

<p>Rest assured that I am not affiliated with the core iPhone dev team, and so I have not received any of the donation money sent to them.  However, my work is built upon theirs and so I will send a portion of the donations I receive to them unless you specify otherwise in your donation (ie. you&#39;ve already donated to them and want this to be separate). </p>

<p>Your support and generosity is appreciated. </p>

There will not be a background by default, so copy FlameFractal.png to Default.png, or your favorite .png to use as a background during password authentication. </p>

<p>Version 0.7.1 ReleasedAn issue where data was being corrupted/deleted if a wrong password was entered, then the app exited without authenticating (issue 49, and probably the cause of 24 and many others) has been resolved. If you had data loss with Lockbox before, I urge you to give it another shot, and backup your ~/Library/Lockbox folder too! </p>

<p>Version 0.7 ReleasedCSV Import - basic CSV import is now available! See the instructions on how to do this. Big thanks to Carsten Heinelt for joining and providing this feature! </p>

<p>Lockbox now works with 1.1.3+. You will also see a Lockbox 1.1.2-1.1.3 migration item in Productivity (or Tweaks 1.1.3) - run this to copy your pre-1.1.3 data over from root&#39;s home to mobile if your data didn&#39;t get copied during your upgrade to 1.1.3. This will overwrite any data in the mobile directory, ie any data that you&#39;ve saved with 0.7 or higher while running 1.1.3 or higher, or that your upgrade path already moved for you. Please run 0.7 first to see if your data is there first. If not, run this script. </p>

<p>Version 0.5 ReleasedI highly recommend installing the BSD Subsystem before upgrading or installing - if you do, you will have Lockbox&#39;s password authentication background become the same as your iPhone&#39;s background. It is the automated process I described here. </p>

<p>Features </p>

<p>Tags - apply multiple tags to items, and filter view items by multiple tags Option to hide secret items in the list view Option to edit items upon selection (ie tap the item anywhere) Change password Lockbox locks when iPhone locks Thanks to Mathias Andersson for the new icon! Bug Fixes </p>

<p>Scrolling bug where the last item wouldn&#39;t display properly    </p>

<p>Version 0.3Finally, the first version is out. It has the core basics - encryption, adding, editing, and removing items, viewing them, etc. Encryption is done via AES128. I used SSCrypto as my engine, with a bit of code cleanup and one bug fix so far :) It uses libcrypto and libssl. </p>

<p>Let me know if you find any bugs, or have any comments, suggestions, or criticism. My email is to the right - nathan at that domain.</p>

 title : The japanese-vocabulary Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>November 16th, 2007 : UpdateI&#39;m in the process of moving this project to SourceForge.  It is now called Benkyou and can be found here.  I am in the process of adding new features to the program as well as creating a web based version that I will be hosting on my website.  The web based version will allow you to create custom vocabulary files and download them for use with the stand-alone application, as well as allow you to practice your vocabulary in a web browser if you prefer.  Please check the new SourceForge site for updates. </p>

<p>OverviewJapanese Vocabulary is, not surprisingly, an application for studying Japanese vocabulary.  It consists of a set of cards, each with 3 pieces of information on them.  The 3 pieces of information are the kanji spelling, kana reading, and English (or other language) meaning.  It uses the Leitner system for managing the cards, which means that you see the cards you know well less often than you see the ones that you don&#39;t know very well.  This allows you to focus on learning those words which you are having trouble with.  The kanji representation of a word (or the kana representation if there is no corresponding kanji for that word) is shown first, and then the user can choose to show the kana and meaning for the word if he/she wants to.  The user then decides if he/she got the word right or not, and the card is either moved into a higher deck (where it will be seen less often) or a lower deck (where it will be seen more often.) </p>

<p>HistoryThis application is my solution to the fact that general flashcard programs don&#39;t work very well for Japanese because sometimes two sides just aren&#39;t enough.  The program will eventually come with flashcards for all of the vocabulary needed for all levels of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT).  I am also planning to add databases for several popular Japanese textbooks, beginning with the Yookoso series which is used at the University of Texas at Austin.  After that I will probably add cards for the Genki series.  The program will eventually let you add your own cards as well. </p>

<p>How Do I Get It?You need to download two files from this website. </p>

<p>The application itself. (Either the Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX version.) The vocabulary file.  (You only need to download this once.) </p>

<p>StatusThis program is still beta, but is very usable as it is.  I have loaded the JLPT level 2, 3, and 4 vocabulary for now.  When downloading the application, make sure you also download the jlpt.vocab file or there won&#39;t be any cards for you to view. </p>

<p>Technical DescriptionThe program is written in C++/QT4 and only uses the QT4 libraries.  Therefore it should run under Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX 10.3.9+. </p>

<p>The vocabulary databases are really SQLite databases.  They can be accessed by using the SQLite v3 client if you wish.  However, the schema isn&#39;t finalized yet, so it probably isn&#39;t a good idea to muck with stuff yet.  I will be adding a nice user interface to manage the database in the future that will allow for, among other things, importing of cards from various formats. </p>

<p>About The AuthorMy name is Andrew Young.  I&#39;m an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, where I am majoring in Linguistics and Japanese.  I work full-time as a software engineer for ARM.  Before working at ARM I worked at IBM, where I was in charge of internationalization of our support website into several languages, including Japanese.  I&#39;ve always been a big anime fan but I hadn&#39;t considered learning Japanese until I began working closely with my Japanese colleagues at IBM.  I&#39;ve been programming professionally since 2000 (although I started programming around 1990), and I began learning Japanese at UT in 2004 (although I&#39;ve been taking a break from my Japanese studies for about a year and have forgotten quite a bit! ^^;).  I&#39;ve been happily married since 2001, and I have a 4 year old daughter.</p>

 summary : <p>JPublish is a Java web publishing framework which merges the Velocity, FreeMarker, StringTemplate or WebMacro templates with a content repository and application control framework. JPublish is designed to ensure a clean separation of developer roles.  </p>

<p>JPublish is loosely based on the FreeEnergy methodology. FreeEnergy was originally created by Leon Atkinson and others as described in his self-authored article Harnessing PHP&#39;s FreeEnergy. Essentially the FreeEnergy methodology was designed to handle page development in an object oriented fashion so that common objects could be reused. Much of JPublish&#39;s initial development ideas were obtained while documenting J.J. Berhens implementation of FreeEnergy in Python, called Aquarium. </p>

 summary : <p>Key MapperMake your keyboard work the way you want it toRemap and disable keyboard keys using a virtual keyboardUnlike other remapping programs, Key Mapper allows remapping and disabling keys for each user on the computer, so it&#39;s possible to have one set of mappings that is enabled at boot time, and a different set for each user who logs on to the computer. </p>

<p>Key Mapper uses a virtual keyboard to create and show mappings. It will change the keyboard to reflect whatever keyboard the user currently has active. You can browse the keyboards installed on your PC if you like. </p>

<p>As a convenience for people who have disabled the Caps Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock keys, Key Mapper has a facility to toggle the value of these keys, in case - for example - an application sets Caps Lock on but the key is disabled. </p>

<p>Key Mapper is a Windows Form application written in C#, targeting the .NET Framework 2.0. Most people download the MSI installer or the Setup package (which use the Native Image Generator (NGEN) to optimise the application at install) but there&#39;s a plain .exe version as well. </p>

 summary : <p>MoNKey!GoalThe goal for this project is to support two-player sessions of m,n,k,p,q-games through a web interface developed using Google App Engine as the framework. </p>

<p>Future goals include adding support for three and four players. </p>

<p>m,n,k,p,q-game?From Wikipedia: </p>

<p>An m,n,k-game is an abstract board game in which two players take turns in placing a stone of their color on an m×n board, the winner being the player who first gets k stones of their own color in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Thus, tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game and free-style gomoku is the 19,19,5-game. </p>

<p>The p and q variables were introduced to support Connect6. From Connect6.org: </p>

<p>Black plays first and puts only q black stone on q unoccupied intersections (also called grids). Subsequently, Black and White alternately put p of their own stones on p unoccupied grids.</p>

TODOFor the Google Summer of Code 2009 I plan to do: </p>

<p>Code refactoring: Reorganize the code according to a broader vision; I must split my code into multiple files: configuration file, language files, tools in separate files, extensions, etc; Change the code comments to use a standard format (see jsdoc-toolkit); Define some coding standards/guidelines. Currently I use tabs instead of spaces (having a width of 4 spaces), and non-wrapping lines. I should most likely adhere to stricter guidelines: word-wrapping at 80 chars, and 2 spaces instead of tabs, like the majority of code; Move the GUI stuff out from the main code, as much as possible. Complete GUI rework. Performance testing for the OLPC XO. Try to optimize as much as possible. Web application packaging. While it&#39;s great to have multiple files and jsdoc comments, it&#39;s better to minify all the code and merge it into a single file, for production use. Having the Web application packaged improves the loading performance a lot. Integration into Moodle and TinyMCE: load and save images. Optionally, I will tackle Internet Explorer compatibility (see ExplorerCanvas). </p>

<p>RequirementsrTorrent minium 0.8.2 / libtorrent 0.12.2 complied with XML-RPC library support - see http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ (0.8.4/0.12.4, 0.8.5/0.12.5 also supported) XML-RPC library - see http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/ Apache webserver configured with XML-RPC - see http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide PHP 5 with XML-RPC module - see http://www.php.net/ A web browser - see http://www.mozilla.com/ InstallationConfigure XML-RPC on your webserver. Change to your webserver root directory, eg: cd /srv/www/htdocs 
<br/>Extract the files from the archive you downloaded: tar xvzf rtgui-x.x.x.tgz 
<br/>If this is a new installation, copy example config file: cp config.php.example config.php 
<br/>Check settings (open config.php in a text editor): vi config.php 
<br/>Point your web browser to the directory, eg: http://localhost/rtgui 
<br/>Enjoy :) See http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/ubuntu_rtgui for a more detailed install guide (Ubuntu specific). </p>

<p>Known ProblemsIncorrect file size display on torrents over 4GB - see http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/CompilingRtorrent and http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/issues/detail?id=1&amp;can=1 </p>

<p>Security considerationsAbsolutely no thought whatsoever has been given to security in rtGui - do not run this on a publicly available website.  rtGui is intended for &#39;home&#39; use where users can be considered as trusted.  A basic authentication mechanism is planned for future releases.  At the very least, you should password protect your webserver using .htaccess or similar (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess for more info). </p>

<p>In DevelopmentMore torrent file management - move directory, delete from disk, etc. Wanted!Feedback! </p>

<p>Other informationrtGui incorporates the excellent subModal script by Seth Banks for the cool &#39;Web 2.0&#39; background-dimming/dialog effect - included version 1.5 by permission - see http://www.subimage.com/dhtml/subModal/ Also uses some icons from http://www.famfamfam.com/</p>

 title : The sprocketcms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SprocketCMSAn Advanced Content Management System for ASP.Net 2.0 </p>

<p>IMPORTANT</p>

<p>The source code here, whilst freely available to do with as you wish, has been advanced an order of magnitude beyond what you&#39;ll be able to download here. Sprocket has become Content Canvas a commercial CMS aimed at solving world hunger, curing cancer and cooking perfect toast. Not too expensive and definitely worth checking out.  </p>

<p>About SprocketSprocket is designed to be flexible in a way that other .Net-based CMS&#39;s are not. Forget &quot;skinnable&quot; and &quot;themes&quot;. Sprocket gives you 100% control over the look and feel of the website you&#39;re developing by separating all UI into a clean and powerful templating system that exposes a useful embeddable scripting language to give you the control you need. Even the admin system is put together using the same system as you would use to build the front-end website, so changing the way it looks and behaves is a piece of cake. </p>

<p>Sprocket has also been built with a distaste for the standard ASP.Net WebForms framework. Rather than wallowing around in a hideous mess of ASPX and ASCX files, Sprocket completely discards any requirement for such things. That&#39;s right, no viewstate, no javascript postbacks, and an extensibility model that is ACTUALLY easy for developers. </p>

<p>CURRENT STATUS: SprocketCMS release 0.4 is more of a framework than a pure CMS, as the UI for creating pages and content is still in development. A full page editing UI and framework will be available in release 0.5. See CurrentStatusRoadMap for more information.  </p>

<p>FeaturesAdvanced, highly flexible pages and templates model that uses friendly URLs. Easier to use than ASP.Net 2.0&#39;s master template system. Simple but powerful scripting language (SprocketScript) which can be used in your templates and content to get the most out of your website. Easy to extend. No, really. A bazillion events and hooks you can use to interrupt the flow wherever you want. Want to make your own module? Implement an interface that has just one method. Use that interface to hook any events that are relevant to you. Sprocket will find the module and do the rest. Advanced AJAX framework. Sprocket translates methods and classes you specify directly into callable javascript objects and methods. All the data transfer and JSON encoding/decoding is done for you (unless you really want to do it). Full security model optional! that supports users, roles, role inheritance and permissions that can be attached to users and/or roles. Multi-tier database management framework to allow you to use whichever database you want. Sprocket is designed to make it as painless as possible to support new databases if desired, and to extend existing modules to support your database of choice. SHOWCASEThe following live websites use varying version of Sprocket: </p>

 title : The svgfig Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SVGFig (pronounced svig-fig)The SVGFig package lets you draw mathematical figures in Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG), using the Python language. </p>

<p>As a tool, its usefulness lies somewhere between freehand drawing programs, which don&#39;t give you quantitative control over your figures, and traditional plotting packages, which fit your data into a prescribed template.  SVGFig allows you to draw anything you can express in Python. </p>

<p>SVGFig is particularly suited to handle non-linear geometries.  All lines, including the coordinate axis, curve if passed through a non-linear coordinate transformation, and coordinate systems can be nested in trees.  This generalizes all the tools necessary for making plots, so it is easy to create polar plots of radial data, Hammer-Aitoff projections of the sky, translations in hyperbolic spaces, or experiment with new representations. </p>

<p>SVGFig also maintains a convenient representation of SVG images as Python constructs, so you can load graphics from SVG files, dissect them, manipulate them with an automated script, and save them in batch. </p>

<p>System RequirementsWritten in pure Python, SVGFig will work on any computer with Python 2.4 or newer installed.  (It will probably work with versions as old as 2.3.) To view SVG images, you will need an SVG 1.1-compliant viewer and/or conversion programs to save to other file types.  Suggestions: Mozilla Firefox browser, Opera browser, Inkscape drawing program, librsvg developer library, and others. Basic IdeaSVGFig defines two classes, SVG and Fig. </p>

<p>SVG is a &quot;document object model&quot; representation of an SVG image, representing it with a tree of Python objects rather than XML. Fig and its associated primitives (Line, Rect, Ellipse, etc.) build graphics that can be transformed by an arbitrary Python function of two variables or on the complex plane.  Figs can be nested, allowing for convenient composition of transformations. When evaluated, Fig primitives are drawn using an adaptive sampling algorithm which evaluates more points on curves than along straight lines.  If a function is discontinuous, it even breaks that curve at the appropriate places. Examples    </p>

<p>See the Example Gallery to get an idea of what SVGFig can do. </p>

<p>HistoryThis product has been in development for over five years.  As a graduate student in physics, I liked to make plots in Mathematica, because it provides access to the underlying primitives.  It has limitations, however, in scope, syntax, and licencing. </p>

<p>At first I tried to find a similar open-source product in the Python language.  PyX comes close: you can draw anything, including curved coordinate axes, but the syntax is lengthy, which is a liability in the heat of intense data analysis.  It also spawns an external LaTeX process to draw text, which lead to synchronization issues when I mistyped LaTeX commands. </p>

<p>I wrote several wrappers of PyX and matplotlib before admitting that I needed to create a new product.  The first version, called Plothon (the Barbarion!), drew primitives using GTK+ (9000 lines).  I hadn&#39;t thought carefully enough about the overall structure, so the result wasn&#39;t much better than existing plotting packages. </p>

<p>Inspired the beautiful idea of generic, nested coordinates systems, I re-wrote the whole project, this time in QT (11000 lines).  Unfortunately, this version became mired in excessive type-checking, which led to recursive loops and random crashes. </p>

<p>Realizing that simplicity is key, I re-wrote everything again, relying on SVG to encode the graphics (4000 lines).  In the process of development, this SVG-based version became a little messy and overstructured, so I purified it, maintaining functionality.  The present version, renamed SVGFig, is only 2300 lines. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s done.  It&#39;s beautiful!  Enjoy it! </p>

<p>Update: after some brainstorming sessions with Jim B. months ago, we came up with an improved structure for the project.  I finally put these ideas together into a 2.0.0alpha2 version that you can read about in Version2Announcement.  As the name implies, it is neither complete nor guaranteed to be bug-free, but if you&#39;re interested in contributing, I would love the help!

 title : The taskpython-web Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>There&#39;s a great Macintosh app called TaskPaper as well as an open source web-based implementation called TaskPaper.web.  My version is another web-based implementation but with the guts written in Python. </p>

<p>The main benefit for me was that unlike TaskPaper.web, TaskPython.web is able to run natively on my jailbroken iPhone with Python and a web server installed. </p>

<p>It works on a normal web server too, and hopefully I&#39;ll be able to write a syncing function between the two. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only tested it with Firefox 3 and the iPhone Safari web browser, but since the html isn&#39;t too wacky, I assume other browsers shouldn&#39;t have too much of a problem with it. </p>

<p>To use: </p>

<p>Make sure you have Python installed on whatever webserver you&#39;re using.  If you are using it on an iPhone, it must also be running a webserver like lighttpd or Apache. </p>

<p>Simply upload the python script(taskpythonweb.py) and task file(todo.txt) to your webserver and make sure to change their permissions on the file to 755. </p>

<p>Then just point your web browser to the Python file and it should work from there. </p>

<p>The look of the app can be changed through the css stylings embedded in the html.</p>

 title : The uniprime Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UniPrimeOverviewUniPrime is an open-source software which automatically designs large sets of universal primers by simply inputting a GeneID reference. UniPrime automatically retrieves and aligns orthologous sequences from GenBank, identifies regions of conservation within the alignment and generates suitable primers that can amplify variable genomic regions. UniPrime differs from previous automatic primer design programs in that all steps of primer design are automated, saved and are phylogenetically limited. We have experimentally verified the efficiency and success of this program. UniPrime is an experimentally validated, fully automated program that generates successful cross-species primers that take into account the biological aspects of the PCR. </p>

<p>The current version is UniPrime 1.18 (Prune / April 2nd, 2008). </p>

<p>DocumentationText files associated with the UniPrime: README INSTALL LICENSE. </p>

<p>DownloadThe Linux/Unix code is publicly available. </p>

<p>Before installing UniPrime, your system must be compliant with the following requirements: </p>

<p>Perl 5.005 or later. BioPerl modules: UniPrime uses functionality provided in BioPerl modules. Primer3 is mandatory since UniPrime is based on Primer3. T-coffee is mandatory if you plan to use multi-alignment option. PostgreSQL is mandatory since UniPrime store all the sequences, alignments and primers in a database. Once you download, uncompress (bunzip2), and un-tar (tar xf), see the file INSTALL for the installation instructions. </p>

<p>TutorialHere is a simple example of a full execution of UniPrime. Each step can be reviewed with the web-companion interface. For a complete explanation consult the file README. </p>

 title : The v-octopus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>V-Octopus is an open-source Web Server to be developed during CSC867 classes at SFSU. </p>

<p>Support to Http/1.1 protocol; Web Services APIs for SOA, using Enterprise Service Bus based on AXIS 2 Package;   &quot;Octopuses are highly intelligent, probably more intelligent than any other order of invertebrates. The exact extent of their intelligence and learning capability is much debated among biologists, but maze and problem-solving experiments have shown that they do have both short- and long-term memory... In laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns.&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus </p>

<p>This kernel of this web server will be based on the features of an octopus, where its short- and long-memory capabilities are the Session and Persistent ones from a regular web server. Furthermore, this server will be able to distinguish between different request types from the regular HTTP usage to the implementation of REST, similar to the capability to distinguish between shares. I gave this name because I like the ocean and its amazing creatures. </p>

<p>It will be based on core JAVA technologies, a hybrid with High- and Low-level concurrent API usage from Java 5/6. Furthermore, it will be completely written from scratch following W3 HTTP1.1 specifications. </p>

 title : The web-actions Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Web Actions in a nutshellWeb Actions is a set of Java native libraries that bring together a few powerful technologies to aid web development process. Framework is focused on rapid developments process by separating flow and process orchestration from concrete code. With a combination of an agile Spring framework and many JSR223 compliant scripting languages we deliver the flexibility, web community were waiting for. 
<br/>What Do We OfferFramework does not limit your abilities but provide a new ways of achieving your goals. We are not re-inventing the wheel, but leveraging existing frameworks and technologies. A a clear way to separate not only business logic from presentation tier, but also business processes from concrete units of work. An ability to make a run-time changes or an functional addition with no performance impact. General ArchitectureThis diagram display a cross section that Web Actions framework occupies. Web Actions act as a bridge between JSR 223 Scripting engine and Spring framework.

 summary : <p>Version 0.11.2 released 2008-03-12 (stable) acer_acpi is a Linux kernel module to allow control of some of the hardware on later model Acer (and other Wistron OEM) laptops. </p>

<p>acer_acpi was originally developed by Mark Smith to enable the wireless LAN card of an Acer Aspire 5024 under 64-bit Linux. The previous solution to hardware access on these laptops, Olaf Tauber&#39;s acerhk, relied on BIOS calls to work - unfortunately, it is not possible to call a 32-bit BIOS routine from a 64 bit operating system, so acer_acpi was born. </p>

<p>If you want to contact the current maintainer, please use carlos(@)strangeworlds.co.uk (Carlos) or the aceracpi (General) mailing list. </p>

<p>8th February 2008 - acer-wmi, the upstream port of acer_acpi, has now been merged into 2.6.25. acer_acpi has now been deprecated in favour of acer-wmi, and is in bug-fix mode only for pre 2.6.25 kernels. </p>

<p>Sourceacer_acpi development has moved to Git - http://repo.or.cz/w/acer_acpi.git </p>

<p>The Subversion repository here will be kept for: </p>

<p>Historical purposes DSDTs, data files, etc, (they will not be moved to Git) PackagesYou are recommended to use a newer kernel with acer-wmi, rather than acer_acpi. </p>

<p>However, if you are still on an older kernel (2.6.24 or earlier), there are a few people who maintain packages for acer_acpi, if you don&#39;t want to build it yourself. (NOTE: I do not produce or maintain any of these builds below, except for the SlackBuild. Do not send or file any bugs about them with me). </p>

<p> WHAT IS THIS? </p>

<p>This is a repository for students who attend Grambling State University and take/have taken courses in Computer Information Systems or Computer Science to freely distribute their projects, while having access to their colleagues&#39; projects as well.  This is NOT cheating.  Again, this is NOT cheating.  Open-sourcing is revolutionizing the way software is being developed because it gives ANYONE an opportunity to view the source code and improve it.  This is in no way, however, a substitute for going to class or doing homework/reading assignments.  This is a place that offers students the opportunity to examine and learn from source code.  The idea for this repository came from MIT&#39;s OpenCourseWare program (http://ocw.mit.edu/).  It&#39;s a valuable resource, and I suggest you use it.  For more information on open source software, please visit the Open Source Initiative (OSI) @ http://www.opensource.org/. </p>

<p> HOW DO I USE THIS REPOSITORY? </p>

<p>Click the &#39;Downloads&#39; tab at the top and arrange the files how you wish.  I suggest you utilize the search option to look through projects.  Projects will always have at least 3 labels; they will be green and follow the file&#39;s summary in this order:  class, professor, language. </p>

<p>For example, the label &#39;cis500 smith java&#39; means that the file was created during the CIS 500 course taught by Professor Smith and written in Java. </p>

<p> The following projects are currently available for download:  </p>

<p>AITP Workshops, Independent Projects, CIS120, CIS203, CIS204, CIS209, CIS210, CIS215, CIS365, CIS371, CIS375, CIS381, CIS385, CIS401 </p>

<p> How to be a successful CIS/CS major at Grambling State University: </p>

<p>(1)  BUY your textbooks, don&#39;t rent them. (2)  READ your textbooks; don&#39;t rely on professors to prepare you 100% for your career. (3)  PRACTICE programming, try and replicate programs on here without looking at the source. (4)  DON&#39;T think you&#39;re a genius because you got an internship.  Keep in mind there&#39;s a million people much better than you, and waiting for your job!  ;) </p>

<p> DISCLAIMER!!!  Neither I, nor any individuals who use/join this project can be held responsible for the actions of others.   </p>

<p> AS FAR AS EXAMS, TESTS, OR ASSIGNMENTS BEING DISTRIBUTED, THEY ARE CONSIDERED THE STUDENTS&#39; OWN INDIVIDUAL SOLUTION TO A GIVEN PROBLEM.  THE SOURCE CODE IS OWNED BY THE STUDENT, NOT THE FACULTY OR STAFF OF Grambling State University, AND CAN BE FREELY DISTRIBUTED AS THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT SEES FIT. </p>

<p> The files within this project are released under the GNU General Public License 2.0. For more information, please refer to the following URL: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html </p>

<p>One more thing... if you’re stupid enough to try and copy/paste a project you found in the repository and hand it in as your own, then you deserve the F your professor’s going to give you.  Also, the GNU License legally considers that stealing.  So DON’T DO IT.</p>

 summary : <p>CocoaSmugMug 1.2An Objective-C wrapper for the SmugMug 1.2 photo service APIs </p>

<p>Release: v1.2 (initial release) </p>

<p>Author: Chris Beauvois </p>

<p>License: MIT </p>

<p>Getting StartedDevelopment Requirements </p>

<p>OS X 10.4.x/10.5.x Cocoa.framework /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.x.dylib (ships with OS X 10.4/5, include in your Xcode project under &quot;Frameworks&quot;)  </p>

<p>SmugMug provides four choices of response formats: REST, JSON, PHP, and XML-RPC (default is REST). CocoaSmugMug delegates parsing responses through a simple protocol that you implement using the toolkit of your choosing for your choice of response format (see ResponseFormatter, declared in CocoaSmugMug.h). </p>

<p>For example: To parse JSON-formatted responses using Blake Seely&#39;s BSJSONAdditions (available at http://blakeseely.com/downloads.html ): </p>

<p>First, implement the ResponseFormatter protocol, or create a new class that implements the protocol: </p>

<p>@interface BSJSONResponseFormatter : NSObject 
<br/>@endResponseFormatter has two methods: </p>

<p>@protocol ResponseFormatter 
<br/>- (NSString *)formatType;
<br/>- (NSDictionary *)formatDictionaryFromResponseData:(NSData *)data;
<br/>@endThe formatType method returns the JSON format type, declared in CocoaSmugMug.h: </p>

<p>- (NSString *)formatType
<br/>{
<br/>	return SMUGMUG_JSON_FORMAT;
<br/>}The formatDictionaryFromResponseData: method converts the JSON-formatted response data into an NSDictionary.  BSJSONAdditions adds a category to NSDictionary for converting a JSON-formatted string into an NSDictionary: </p>

<p>#import &quot;NSDictionary+BSJSONAdditions.h&quot;</p>

<p>- (NSDictionary *)formatDictionaryFromResponseData:(NSData *)data
<br/>{
<br/>	// create an autoreleased NSString from data
<br/>	NSMutableString *jsonString = [[[NSMutableString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease];</p>

<p>	// fix JSON URLs
<br/>	[jsonString replaceOccurrencesOfString:@&quot;\\/&quot; withString:@&quot;/&quot; options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [string length])];</p>

<p>	// now, format the response using the NSDictionary+BSJSONAdditions category
<br/>	NSDictionary *responseDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithJSONString:jsonString];
<br/>	
<br/>	return responseDictionary;
<br/>}UsageWhen instanciating CocoaSmugMug, the designated initializer&#39;s single argument is an instance of your formatter: </p>

<p>	BSJSONResponseFormatter *formatter = [[[BSJSONResponseFormatter alloc] init] autorelease];
<br/>	CocoaSmugMug *smugmug = [[CocoaSmugMug alloc] initWithResponseFormatter:formatter];You are now ready to begin using CocoaSmugMug: </p>

<p>	// login
<br/>	SmugMugResponse *response = [smugmug secureLoginWithAPIKey:apiKey email:userEmail password:userPassword];</p>

<p>	// login with password hash
<br/>	NSString *hash = [[[response responseDictionary] objectForKey:@&quot;Login&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;PasswordHash&quot;];
<br/>	NSString *userID = [[[[response responseDictionary] objectForKey:@&quot;Login&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;User&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;id&quot;];	
<br/>	response = [smugmug loginWithAPIKey:apiKey userID:userID passwordHash:hash];</p>

<p>	// to use SSL for all requests (be sure to add libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib to your Xcode project&#39;s frameworks) 
<br/>	[smugmug setShouldUseSSL:YES];</p>

<p>	// to get your account tree, albums or categories
<br/>	response = [smugmug getTree];
<br/>	NSLog(@&quot;\n\ngetTree:\n%@\n\n-------------------------------------&quot;, [response responseDictionary]);
<br/>	response = [smugmug getAllAlbums];
<br/>	NSLog(@&quot;\n\ngetAllAlbums:\n%@\n\n-------------------------------------&quot;, [response responseDictionary]);
<br/>	response = [smugmug getAllSubCategories];
<br/>	NSLog(@&quot;\n\ngetAllSubCategories:\n%@\n\n-------------------------------------&quot;, [response responseDictionary]);</p>

<p>	// to create a category
<br/>	response = [smugmug createCategory:@&quot;Test Category&quot;];
<br/>	NSNumber *testCategoryID = [[[response responseDictionary] objectForKey:@&quot;Category&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;id&quot;];</p>

<p>why there is another library?all most all javascript library do things such as array utilities, string utilities, DOM, Event, Animation, Drag &amp; Drop, widgets, browser compatibilities, layout management, standard components ... If we do NOT used a library, we had to cope with those thing ourselves, we lost our development efficiency. If we use a library, generally we had to load a big extra library file, we lost executive efficiency.  double underscore tries to solves those problems. double underscore is NOT a all in one library, it only cope with things we are most probably faced with in daily web development. And it used a uncoupling structure which means you could always optimize your loading size by easily remove those unused parts.</p>

<p>A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports W3C ARIA. Adaptive technologies that respond correctly to the accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA. In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX depend on support for live regions a feature that enables adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to portions of a Web page. </p>

<p>The AxsJAX framework can inject accessibility enhancements into existing Web 2.0 applications using any of several standard Web techniques: </p>

<p>As a bookmarklet --- small snippets of JavaScript that are used to create smart bookmarks. Using Greasemonkey --- a powerful browser extension that allows end-users to customize the look and feel of Web sites via custom scripts. Using Fire Vox --- Fire Vox, an open source talking browser extension for Firefox, automatically injects the AxsJAX scripts if the &quot;Use site specific enhancements&quot; option is turned on. For a information on getting started writing your own AxsJAX scripts, please see our tutorial. </p>

<p>There is also a video tutorial available here. </p>

<p>We are also giving away Google-AxsJAX shirts for anyone who contributes good scripts to the project.</p>

 title : The gsubfn Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>gsubfn is an R package providing utilities for strings and function arguments. The key command, also called gsubfn, is like gsub but can take a function, formula, list or proto replacement object. </p>

<p>Below on this page are sections on:  </p>

<p>NEWSOVERVIEWCITATIONBUGSEXAMPLES </p>

<p>NEWSNews can be found in the NEWS file (also available within R in the package itself).  Also note that, except for a few, the examples and other information that were previously on this page have been moved to the vignette available within R via library(gsubfn); vignette(&quot;gsubfn&quot;) </p>

<p>March 23, 2010. gsubfn 0.5-2 has been uploaded to CRAN.  It is a bug fix version -- there are no new features. </p>

<p>March 16, 2010.  A new version of gsubfn 0.5-1 is on CRAN.  The main new feature is that it is not dependent on tcltk, instead tcltk is merely suggested.  If gsubfn is run on an R installation where tcltk is not present then strapply, which normally uses underlying code written in tcl, falls back to an all R version (which is slower but largely compatible). </p>

<p>July 2, 2009.  gsubfn 0.5-0 is on CRAN.  Main new features are that strapply runs faster and by default strapply uses the tcl regexp engine.  See the May 14, 2009 news item below for a performance comparison. </p>

<p>May 14, 2009.  A new version of strapply has been committed to the svn repository.  The core of it has been rewritten to use tcl via R&#39;s tcltk package.  It runs several times faster than the previous version of strapply on larger problems.  It requires the tcltk package (which is bundled with R on Windows, UNIX and on the full binary version of R on Mac).  One implication of this is that strapply now uses Tcl regular expressions.  TODO: There are still some incompatibilities with the old strapply that need to be ironed out and proto support still needs to be reimplemented but most examples now run the same as before. </p>

<br/>   3.88    0.06    3.95 April 25, 2009.  In EXAMPLES section we added reference to a new book by Stefan Th. Gries which includes examples of using this package. </p>

<p>Dec 22, 2008.  Added mixsort example in the EXAMPLES section below. </p>

<p>Dec 14, 2008. Uploaded gsubfn 0.3-8 to CRAN.  Should be available on CRAN shortly.  See NEWS file. </p>

<p>Dec 9, 2008.  Added detabbing example in the EXAMPLES section below. </p>

<p>Nov 30, 2008.  Added the character escaping example to the EXAMPLES section below. </p>

<p>Oct 28, 2008.  devel version now has improved backref default.  Previously it was minus the number of left parens in the regexp. Now it is minus the number of non-escaped left parens in the regexp.  To use this version in the interim until its available on CRAN do this in R: </p>

<p>library(gsubfn)
<br/># overwrite relevant function with devel version of it
<br/>source(&quot;http://gsubfn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/R/gsubfn.R&quot;)See this example on r-help. </p>

<p>Oct 18/08.  gsubfn version 0.3-7 is now on CRAN (and in the svn under the Source tab above on this site).  The new version of gsubfn fixes all known bugs, adds list replacement objects and changes the backref= default in the gsubfn and strapply commands.  Although the changed default introduces an incompatibility with prior versions this incompatability is small because it only affects situations where backeferences are present in the regular expression and backref was not used.  Since the previous default for backref was not useful there would be very few, if any, such cases. On the other hand it means that in most cases backref= will not need to be specified as it now takes a more useful default. See announcement. </p>

<p>OVERVIEWgsubfn is an R package used for string matching, substitution and parsing.  Its is freely available under the GNU Public License and is available on CRAN now. </p>

<p>gsubfn.  A seemingly small generalization of the R gsub function, namely allow the replacement string to be a replacement function, formula or proto object, can result in significantly increased power and applicability.  The resulting function, gsubfn, is the namesake of this package. In the case of a replacement formula the formula is interpreted as a function with the right side of the formula representing the body of the function. In the case of a replacement proto object the object space is used to store persistant data to be communicated from one function invocation to the next as well as to store the replacement function/method itself. </p>

<p>strapply. Built on top of gsubfn is strapply which is similar to gsubfn except that it returns the output of the function rather than substituting it back into the source string.  The argument list is analogous to apply with the string being operated on being the first argument, the regular expression taking the place of the dimension or second argument and an optional function to apply to the match as the third argument. A common use of strapply is to split or extract strings based on content rather than delimiters. </p>

<p>fn$. The ability to have formula arguments that represent functions can be used not only in the functions of the gsubfn package but can also be used with any R function without modifying its source.  Just preface any R function with fn$ and subject to certain rules to distinguish which formulas are intended to be functions and which are not, the formula arguments will be translated to functions, e.g.  </p>

<p>fn$integrate(~ x^2, 0, 1)The fn$ prefix will also perform quasi-perl style string interpolation on character arguments (subject to certain rules to determine which are intended to be subject to such translation). e.g. </p>

<p>fn$cat(&#39;pi = $pi, exp = `exp(1)`\n&#39;)match.funfn.  match.funfn is provided to allow developers to readily build this functionality into their own functions so that even the fn$ prefix need not be used. </p>

<p>CITATIONTo get the citation for this package use the R command: </p>

<p>citation(&quot;gsubfn&quot;)BUGS1. strapply may give an error if a variable c is defined in your workspace.  To avoid this remove c, or use ostrapply in place of strapply (but then you won&#39;t get the tcl engine) or use the devel version of strapply where its been fixed. </p>

 summary : <p>Gom! </p>

<p>Gom allows you to write GTK applications using JavaScript and an HTML-like widget layout syntax. </p>

<p>It does this by first implementing a W3C DOM Level 1 (Core) API for interacting with GTK widgets and windows, then by providing a JavaScript binding to this layer. </p>

<p>Those are the goals, at any rate.  It is certainly a work in progress; basically examples/hello.gom works and probably not much more. </p>

<p>Gom is on the Web! </p>

<p>http://ilovegom.googlecode.com/ </p>

<p>To build Gom, you need to check out and build Mozilla&#39;s JavaScript engine - SpiderMonkey.  Instructions are here: </p>

<p>http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SpiderMonkey_Build_Documentation </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, it is a small amount of code and should build easily and quickly. </p>

<p>When running Gom&#39;s configure script, you should point it at your mozilla checkout using the --with-mozilla-source=</p>

<p> option. </p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve build gom, you can pass a .gom file to load on the command line: </p>

<p>$ ./gom examples/hello.gom </p>

<p>It will spew a bunch of garbage to the command line, but if all goes well a window will pop up.  Close the window with your windowmanager, and gom should exit.</p>

<p>See also: http://boilen.codeplex.com/ </p>

<p>WhatMuch like any other code generator, NCodeX (pronounced &quot;encode-ex&quot;) is designed to take much of the grunt work out of coding common programming patterns.  It includes support for events (declaring/raising), properties (including ShouldSerialize/Reset designer support), argument guards, standard interfaces (IDisposable, IEquatable, IComparable), and for .NET 3.0 specific constructs like dependency properties and routed events, to name a few. </p>

<p>Generated types are declared in XAML (Extensible Application Markup Langauge), which allows for flexible extension using XAML&#39;s built-in styles and templates, and for a rich design experience in any tool supporting XAML or WPF.  Although NCodeX requires .NET 3.0 for code generation, the generated code itself can be targeted at any framework version. </p>

<p>WhyBesides producing a useful tool to remove a little more repetetion and make library design more declarative, this project is also an exploration for the developers into WPF&#39;s more advanced features, such as styles and templates.</p>
 title : The netcdf4-python Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API modelled after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that module. </p>

<p>Most new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple unlimited dimensions, groups and zlib data compression. All the new numeric data types (such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented. Compound and variable length (vlen) data types are supported, but the enum and opaque data types are not. Mixtures of compound and vlen data types (compound types containing vlens, and vlens containing compound types) are not supported. </p>

<p>NEWS:  </p>

<p>20100226 There is a bug writing netCDF-4 files on big-endian platforms with more than 8 attributes attached to a variable or group.  It is described here: </p>

<p>http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/known_problems/index.html 
<br/>That bug is fixed by release HDF5 1.8.4 Patch 1, available from the HDF5 downloads page: </p>

<p>http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html 
<br/>Building any version of netcdf-4 with HDF5 1.8.4 Patch 1 fixes that bug.    </p>

<p>A separate, unrelated bug in netcdf-4.1 requires the conditions described here: </p>

<p>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/netcdfgroup/2010/msg00070.html  
<br/>That bug is fixed in the forthcoming netcdf-4.1.1 release. </p>

<p>20100209: Version 0.9 released (bugfixes, netcdf-4.1 compatibility). </p>

<p>20090818: Version 0.8.2 released.  vlen and compound types fully supported with netcdf-4.1-beta2 or higher. </p>

<p>20090621: Version 0.8.1 released with experimental variable-length (vlen) data type support. </p>

<p>20090603:  Compound types now work properly since the netcdf-4.1-beta-20090603 snapshot.  I&#39;ve disabled the compound types tests until 4.1 is released. </p>

<p>20090421: The initial compound data type support is 0.8 is broken (it only works correctly if all the members of the compound type have the same bit width).  I&#39;m trying to figure out if this is a bug in the netcdf library, the extension module, or both.  So, if you are concerned about the test failures, just move tst_compoundvar.py out of the way.   </p>

<p>20090418: version 0.8 released with support for compound data types (which map to numpy structured, i.e. &#39;record&#39;, arrays). </p>

<p>20090402: tst_dap.py in version 0.7.7 will fail due to a bug in the newly released netcdf-4.0.1 final. To skip the dap test, just rename test/tst_dap.py to test/tst_dap.py.skip and run test/run_all.py again. </p>

<p>20090217: version 0.7.7 released.  David Huard has re-worked &#39;fancy indexing&#39;, adding new features and making it less of a memory hog. However, it is now no longer compatible with numpy fancy indexing - 1d arrays of boolean or integer indices work independently on each dimension (similar to the way vector subscripts work in fortran).  This enables things like: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; tempdat = temp[[0,1,3],lats&gt;0,lons&gt;0](retrieves 1st, 2nd and 4th levels, all Northern Hem. and Eastern Hem. grid points - note that this would raise an error in numpy). </p>

<p>20090124: netcdf4-python now included in the Enthought Python Distribution (v4.1.30101). </p>

<p>20081223: If built against netcdf-4.0.1-beta2 (compiled with --enable-dap), you can access remote opendap datasets by specifying a URL instead of a filename when creating a Dataset instance. </p>

<p>20080922: Version 0.7.6 released.  See Changelog. </p>

<p>20080801: Version 0.7.5 released.  Bugfixes, mainly in MFDataset.  Some new features  in MFDataset. </p>

<p>20080508: Version 0.7.4 released.  Use with netcdf-4.0 and HDF5 1.8.1. </p>

<p>20080414: Version 0.7.3.1 does not work with recent snapshots of the netCDF4 library. Click the &#39;Source&#39; tab to download the latest source from SVN instead.  I&#39;m waiting the netcdf-4-beta2 (due any day now) before making a new source release. </p>

<p>20080101: As of version 0.7.3, a netCDF3 module is now included, for those who don&#39;t want to install bleeding-edge versions of the netcdf-4 and HDF5 libraries.  Some features not found the Scientific.IO.NetCDF module: </p>

<p>ability to read multi-file netCDF Datasets, making variables spanning multiple files appear as if they were in one file. support for masked arrays, automatic packing and unpacking of  packed integer data. supports more complicated slicing (including numpy &#39;fancy indexing&#39;). includes convenience functions for converting to and from datetime objects to numeric time values, using all the calendars in the CF metadata standard. convenience functions for converting arrays of characters to arrays of strings, and vice-versa. can use numpy dtype objects to specify netCDF variable datatype.</p>

 title : The openvis3d Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Authors:  Abhijit Ogale: Overall library design, Dense stereo and optical flow code. Justin Domke: 3D egomotion estimation Acknowledgements:  Open-source grant from Google. Professor Yiannis Aloimonos, Computer Vision Lab, University of Maryland. DOWNLOAD OpenVis3D README.txt Code documentation References Sample results (Symmetric dense stereo and optical flow with occlusions)  GoalThe goal of this project is to provide a library of efficient 3D computer vision routines for image and video processing. It includes routines for dense stereo matching, optical flow (motion) estimation, occlusion detection, and egomotion (3D self-motion) estimation. </p>

<p>BenefitsProvides symmetric dense stereo matching with occlusions, symmetric dense optical flow with occlusions, probabilistic 3D egomotion estimation. Designed as a template library. Uses adapters to be compatible with Matlab, OpenCV, and can be easily tailored to be used with any other image processing library. Example code is included for OpenCV and Matlab. See the README.txt within the download. Internal image template class OvImageT can be wrapped around OpenCV or Matlab image data, and provides Matlab-style functionality, including: Operators:  Arithmetic: +  -  /    +=  -=  /=  = Comparison: &lt;  =  &gt; Logical:   !   ||  &amp;&amp;  Math: cos  sin  tan  acos  asin  atan  atan2 cosh  sinh  tanh  exp  log  log10  abs  ceil  floor round mod  pow  pow  sqrt  Bottom line:   We can have expressions like iflag = (1+exp(-i2*i3)) &lt; i4 , where iflag is a boolean image and i2, i3, i4 are double images (say). Direct efficient pixel access by overloading function call operator: A(row,col,channel) E.g., A(1,5,2) = 10; Masked assignment and sub-image access, e.g.,  A.copyMasked(mask, B); A.copyMasked(mask, 5); A = B.getSubImage(5,10,3,11); Matlab-like functions: convolve2D, filter2D with arbitrary 2D kernel medianFilter2D, meanfilter2D, minFilter2D, maxFilter2D min, max, mean, sum along any dimension.  repmat, reshape, meshgrid. transpose, flipLR, flipUD, shiftImageXY, resize (nn, bilinear), random, gaussian, oriented gabor, rgb2gray. And many more ... Modular structure of Stereo and Optical flow code makes it easy to add new algorithms for local matching, global matching, pre- and post-processing.

 summary : <p>This is a write-up for a project for a chat server for use by the practicum teams. </p>

<p>Problem StatementFranklin University online courses utilize a chat for discussion threads among the students and the instructor. There are shortcomings with this implantation. First is that the use of the chat is limited to students enrolled within one class. The practicum is conducted across multiple classes as the teams are formed. Finally, there is no ability to have a private chat among a subset of the students working as one team. Therefore, the practicum needs the ability to have a single chat that is accessible by all current practicum students as well as chats for project teams. </p>

<p>RequirementsThis document is NOT a full requirements document for the system. That will be developed by the student practicum team for approval by the instructor as part of the project. There will be high level or general directions stated here followed by constraints or design directions in the next section. The instructor will work with the team to formulate a full requirements document. </p>

<p>Feature IdeasThese are the initial ideas on how the system should work. These concepts will be refined into a final feature set as part of the requirements phase. </p>

<p>This is expected to be a web application to avoid desktop code issues on each student’s desktop.  The system needs three types of chats – global, per course, and per project. The global chat will be primarily used by the instructor for practicum wide discussions. The per-course chat will be used for class wide discussions, most notably by the COMP495 students for a number of assignments. Finally, each team will have a chat for discussions private to the scope of their project. Thus permissions are clear – each student can see/use the global chat, his/her class chat, and his/her project chat. The instructor can see all chats to see and answer any questions. Upon login, only the proper chat rooms should be displayed according to the user permissions.  Each chat room will display the discussion thread and a list of the users online.  All chats will be recorded for reference by students as a log. A page showing past chats for display will be referenced on login. The user can then access and display past chat sessions.  Each entry in a chat will be marked with the user name and the timestamp of the entry. These will also appear in the log.  There will be a small number of users for the board, i.e. only the current practicum students as defined in the chat’s database as well as the instructor. There will be no registration process of new users. Only the admin/instructor can add users. Since this is done only once per semester, it is acceptable to do this directly into the database with no admin screen. If time permits, an admin screen for user and group administration can be added. The login and authentication is a 2 step process. The system will maintain a list of students, the course they are in, and the project team to which they are assigned. When logging in, the user is authenticated against the Franklin LDAP database to verify the password.  The system should be modular. The layout, style/color, and organization should all be separately manageable. The final feature set will be determined as part of the requirements process. The amount of work to be committed will depend on the experience of the project team and the allotted time available in the semester. The instructor will serve as customer/user. </p>

<p>Design ConstraintsThe following are design constraints or suggestions </p>

<p> The base technology used should be PHP code on an Apache platform. The DBMS used should be MySQL.  It is preferable to have the web framework use a MVC pattern using the Smarty template engine to separate layout, business logic, and data model.  All color/style should be coded in CSS files. The look of the website should thus be controlled from a CSS file. Changing of this file should be the primary way to change the look of the website.  Smarty based templates can be used for the overall page layouts. This changing of this template (and a CSS file) should be able to change the entire layout of the page. Use of the CSS method to control layout (the “div method”) is strongly encouraged over the use of HTML tables to control layout.  Sending and receiving the chat text is an issue. As a web application, updating of the page text is normally done via a new page hit. However, the page refresh and page blink is a problem. If all of the code is on one page, a page refresh will lose any input being currently typed in. This can be somewhat circumvented by using frames. The modern solution is to use AJAX technology to get and send data without a page refresh. This is the preferred method.  An example code module for LDAP authentication will be provided. This will show how the LDAP system at Franklin is set up as well as the appropriate server names.</p>

 title : The pococapsule Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PocoCapsule is an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, a.k.a Dependency Injection (DI) framework (see article IoC vs DI), as well as a Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) engine (see article DSM in IoC). The main goals of PocoCapsule are to support declarative assemblying/deploying/configuring of component-based C/C++ applications and also to provide a platform that can easily be used even by domain users to quickly build other component frameworks in a descriptive modeling approach. </p>

<p>PocoCapsule is non-invasive and enforces neither a proprietary component programming model (such as their base classes or a set of pre-defined methods) nor any component-container couplings (such as registry or context lookup). It accepts container-agnostic plain-old C/C++ objects (POCO) as components. Examples of such components include instances of arbitrary C++ classes, template classes (such as all STL container classes), K&amp;R structs, arrays, and even functions (as function pointers).  PocoCapsule supports almost all useful IoC invocation scenarios regardless the numbers of their value/reference inject arguments (in various types, aggregated types, and even user defined types). These invocations include:  Constructors (and destructors in lifecycle control) of arbitrary C++ classes/structs/unions/arrays.  Global C or C++ functions, operators, and variables.  Non-static member functions and operators of C++ classes/structs.  Static member functions of C++ classes/structs.  Non-static data members of C++ classes/structs.  Static data members of C++ classes/structs.  Union field accesses.  Array (as well as C++ classes/structs with index operator) indexed accesses.  PocoCapsule supports component lifecycle control with any of the following methods specified by user:  constructors of C++ classes/structs/unions/arrays  global or static factory methods  non-static factory methods of factory-beans  global or static ref duplicate methods  non-static duplicate methods of the beans themselves  global or static ref release/destroy methods (and destructors)  non-static ref release/destroy methods of destroy-beans.  non-static release/destroy methods of the beans themselves.  PocoCapsule ensures type safety. All type conversions are validated statically in building dynamic invocation proxies. The dynamic reflection engine only uses proxies that exactly match the signatures of IoC invocations. PocoCapsule supports dynamic wiring that allows application to be deployed without immediately being wired with dependent services. These services can be wired or rewired to applications transparently after or upon they (these services) become available or being replaced. PocoCapsule seamlessly supports user-defined domain specific modeling schemas through model transformations. These DSM schemas describe applications architectures at higher abstraction levels. This mechanism not only largely avoids problems of the verbose, error-prone, and primitive core IoC schema but also makes the PocoCapsule a framework that can be used by domain users to quickly and easily build other user-defined or committee-designed component frameworks. Several such DSM frameworks are presented in PocoCapsule out-of-the-box or from third parties, such as:  PocoCapsule for WebServices: supports wiring and deployment of component-based WebServices applications.

 title : The pyccsm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PyMCT Start PageIntroductionPyMCT consists of a suite of software packages necessary to build and run a Python Coupler like PyCCSM. MCT is a high performance regridding and parallel communication package designed to address issues of coupling multiple scientific models on different scales and grids to one another. </p>

<p>ArchitectureSystem OverviewPyMCT wraps the Fortran 90 MCT library and makes it available to Python Programmers.  This wrapping is not normally possible due to complex issues with the many different interpretations of the Fortran 90 standard.  However, a powrful tool, the CCA Babel project allowed us to address these issues and completely wrap the MCT functionality into Python. </p>

<p>ComponentsThe following components are necessary to build and use MCT and PyMCT </p>

<p>MCTFortran 90 Compiler MPI (we use MPICH2) BabelC, Java, and Fortran compilers ( Portland Group Fortran is NOT supported!  ) Python Interpreter Chasm Numpy or Numeric Python array packages    </p>

<p>Python MPIThere are a number of Python bindings to MPI out there, but the only one that completely meets the requirements of our package is our own solution, MaroonMPI.  Depending on your application you may have reasonable success with other bindings. </p>

<p>Embedding the Python Interpreter to make Mac OS X Applications bundle. Python Application Stub is similar to Apple’s Java Application Stub and uses the Core Foundation to access to Mac OS X features.  </p>

<p>Build on Leopard </p>

<p>%$ make CURRENT </p>

<p>This will produce FAT binaries containing i686, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures, except for the main stub e.g PythonApplicationStub and PythonApplicationStub64 that you can find in PythonApplicationLauncher.framework/Resources/MacOS </p>

<p>%$ make HOST_LEOPARD_FAT </p>

<p>This will produce FAT binaries containing i686 and ppc architectures e.g 32-bit, all other targets are un-documentated and are under legacy support, to activate the internal debug mode you have to change build flags: </p>

<p>-Ddebug_trace=1 -Dmacroassert=1 -Dmacrolog=0 </p>

<p>or  </p>

<p>-Ddebug_trace=1 -Dmacroassert=0 -Dmacrolog=1 </p>

<p>Overview </p>

<p>Thread-safe behaviour does not apply for versions inferior to 103.2, Thread-not-safe version, hold a copy of PythonApplicationLauncher framework into each bundle. The PythonApplicationLauncher framework (103.2 or later)  can also be deployed at Application/Bundle level, but we prefer that you use &quot;/Library/Frameworks&quot; folder rather than &quot;$BUNDLE_PATH/Contents/Frameworks&quot; to store it, because we plan to add an auto-updater. </p>

 title : The shapelogic-cpp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ShapeLogic C++ShapeLogic C++ is an open source toolkit for declarative programming, image processing and computer vision. Optimized for simplicity of programming. Started September 2008. </p>

<p>The first real application for ShapeLogic Java is a particle analyzer. It will find and categorize particles on a relatively uniform background then make a report of geometric properties for each of the particles. The main application is for recognizing cells in medical image processing. </p>

<p>Join the ShapeLogic mailing list for announcements, questions, bug reports, suggestions and feature requests. </p>

<p>Main ideas and motivation for ShapeLogicShapeLogic is a library for </p>

<p>Declarative programming and lazy computations in C++ Image processing and computer vision Particle analyzer for medical image processing While ShapeLogic&#39;s declarative programming system was initially developed  for image processing and computer vision, it is widely applicable. It is currently difficult to combine declarative programming and image processing. ShapeLogic is intended as basic plumbing software that turns a logic engine  into a simple plugin component to ease entry into vision and image  analysis. ShapeLogic also fills gaps missing from current Java image  processing libraries, and uses a commercially friendly license. </p>

<p>ShapeLogic has an automatic color particle counter and analyzer and a letter matching example. </p>

<p>FeaturesIt is free (as in free speech and free beer) Commercially friendly MIT open source license Programmed in C++  </p>

<p>ShapeLogic C++ under Windows </p>

<p> </p>

<p>ShapeLogic C++ under Linux </p>

<p>Getting Started linksShapeLogic project home page is the main source of information. </p>

<p>A Getting Started page for ShapeLogic C++ will be put up when there are working code. </p>

<p>RequirementsFor running as a library for functional and declarative programming there are no requirements. </p>

<p>For running as a ImageJ plugin ShapeLogic uses the following libraries: </p>

<p>Boost the C++ library OpenCV for computer vision algorithms Generic Image Library which is part of Boost as of v 1.35 FLTK, Fast Light Toolkit lightweight cross platform GUI Google Testing Framework Boost.build v2 for command line based build system Eclipse CDT for IDE based build system </p>

<p>Development Status: AlphaShapeLogic is in Alpha, as of version 0.4 Same code runs under both Windows and Linux  Contains some image processing algorithms Unit test are setup Builds can be done both with Bjam and Eclipse News2009/03/22 ShapeLogic C++ 0.5 releasedAdded binary thresholds operations Threshold with fixed limit of 127 Adaptive threshold with a small block size of 3 Added morphological operations Dilate Erode 2008/11/14 ShapeLogic C++ 0.4 releasedImages are now internally stored in OpenCV&#39;s IplImage format More image formats: BMP, DIB, JPEG, JPG, JPE, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, SR, RAS, TIFF, TIF Made a few OpenCV image processing algorithm available: Canny edge detector Flip RB color Flip horizontally Flip vertically Made Boost Build Jamfiles that works both on Windows and other operating systems First release with development status Alpha 2008/10/31 ShapeLogic C++ 0.3 released   </p>

<p>Added 3 first brushes: Pen, Sample color, Point info Fixed bugs causing ShapeLogic to crash </p>

<p>2008/10/22 ShapeLogic C++ 0.2 released   </p>

<p>Save images using GIL Scroll big images Display file name in window frame </p>

<p>2008/10/16 ShapeLogic C++ 0.1 released   </p>

<p>Integrate FLTK, Boost, GIL, Google C++ Testing Frameworks, Boost Build Minimalist GUI to load images and run image processing operations Image processing code written in GIL Tested on Windows and Linux </p>

<p>2008/09/03 Start of experimental port from Java to C++   An experimental port of ShapeLogic to C++ has begun. The algorithms in ShapeLogic are not using anything too languages specific so they should be portable to similar languages say C++ and C#. The idea with ShapeLogic is that it should be a declarative framework for vision and you should be able to get work done by making rules instead of regular procedural or object oriented programming. For example should be able to make a list of rules for categorizing the shape of a particle in a particle analyzer. You put them in a database or a flat file and the same rules should work for C++ and Java version of ShapeLogic. </p>

<p>Future plans for ShapeLogicFor more up to date information on ongoing development work look at these </p>

<p>Blog Declarative Computer Vision Roadmap </p>

<p>ShapeLogic C++ v 0.6 soon to be releasedMake OpenCV more image processing algorithm available in menus Make generic dialog to get parameters for algorithms Improve threshold to have a user input for limit Examples applications for ShapeLogic JavaAutomatic color and gray scale particle counter and analyzer, first medical image processing example Letter matching example. Very rudimentary OCR. Mathematical problems from Project Euler. This is a list of 192 mathematical problems that can be solved by computers. They vary in complexity from simple to hard. The goal is to test ShapeLogic&#39;s new declarative and functional constructs on real problems and make sure they are terse and intuitive. Site last modified 2009-05-14</p>

 title : The stablebox Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Stablebox is a derived version of Busybox, intended for those who are more concerned with stability and a more defined-scope than is currently provided by Busybox. </p>

<p>Stablebox started life as a fork of Busybox at the 1.2.2.1 branch, where functionality was relatively mature and complete.  It&#39;s primary audience is embedded device developers who need a mature and stable product, and are primarily wanting additional code added only for bug fixes and important enhancements. </p>

<p>The project has the following primary goals: </p>

<p>Maintain a stable code base -- modifications should be done on a limited and carefully measured scope, primarily focused on bug fixes. Reduce the feature set to only include the truly core Linux system utilities.  Larger, less integrated features should be removed, and instead should be supported by other projects than Stablebox. Not churning source code for style or naming-convention changes.  Becoming a functioning desktop replacement, or working on non-Linux OS will be avoided as well. </p>

<p>The target audience for this project is developers of embedded products running the Linux OS. </p>

<p>License: As noted, the source code for this project is under the GPLv2 license.  Much discussion and legal headache resulted in this being the license for Busybox after the 1.2.2.1 release, the point at which Stablebox was forked.</p>

<p>It allows you to implement relational learning and structured predictions problems such as  </p>

<p>Entity Resolution Link Prediction Dependency Parsing Semantic Tagging Sentence Compression Chunking </p>

<p>by simply defining a model and providing training data. Learning and inference are both handled by thebeast.  </p>

<p>thebeast uses Markov Logic as language to describe complex Markov Networks. In Markov Logic first order predicates and formulas describe the nodes and connectivity of Markov Networks. Compared to alchemy, another Markov Logic Engine, thebeast uses a different MAP inference technique (Integer Linear Programming with Cutting Planes), and may be faster at times.  </p>

<p>FeaturesFast and exact MAP inference using Cutting Planes combined with Integer Linear Programming (or Max-Walk-Sat), see the corresponding paper on Cutting Plane Inference for Markov Logic Online Discriminative Training using MIRA, Perceptron and Passive Aggressive Learning Parametrized weights: use one formula to describe millions of features with individual weights Shell: Use a interpreter to edit and inspect your model. Allows you to analyze errors, inspect feature weights and scores Cardinality constraints: make statements about how often certain conditions should hold in a solution. Missing FeaturesA more complete manual Inference for marginal probabilities (Gibbs Sampling) Pseudo-Likelihood training EM Structure-Learning: automatically find good formulas ... For these I recommend the alchemy system.  </p>

<p>Your WorkIf you use thebeast for your project and it has been helpful (or not) I&#39;d be happy to hear about it. I&#39;d also be happy if you could send me a copy of any published work that uses thebeast. Finally, it would be great if you could cite this paper in such a publication.</p>
