 summary : <p>New ReleaseUpdated documentatin to come.  v3.0 includes many bug fixes and enhanced funtionality. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dexter is a tool for producing XSLT 1.0-compliant stylesheets to style arbitrary XML data into human-readable XHTML  using the design document as the source. Thus changes to the visual layout may be propagated directly to the XSLT through a predictable, automated process.  While it can be used with many other XML formats such as WML or RSS, formats with complex attribute-value structures such as SVG will be supported with extension modules in the future.    </p>

<p>Dexter allows users to define extended attributes which can be associated with descriptors and editors. These attributes can be embedded into any well-formed XML document. The resulting embellished document, the &#39;source&#39;, is then input to the dexter engine.  This will generate one or more XSLT stylesheets describing the input document interpolating editor modifications and any instructions specified by the descriptors.   </p>

<p>Operations are specified exclusively with extended attributes embedded in per-module custom namespaces so web browsers will continue to see the decorated source exactly as the web designer saw it before.  Thus, the changes we effect while preparing the design document as source for dexter are effectively transparent to all but dexter. </p>

<p>Input Documents
<br/>Dexter does not validate input documents, but does expect them to be strictly well-formed XML or XHTML as it uses the JVM&#39;s default configured JAXP parser to produce the Document object against which dexter performs it&#39;s operations.  This constraint helps guarantee that the documents produced from the resulting XSLT will accurately reflect the input document. </p>

<p>Dexter is designed to handle arbitrarily complex input documents so long as they are well-formed. </p>

<p>Example Usage
<br/>For an example of dexter&#39;s usage, refer to dexter.html.  It serves as the design document for dexter&#39;s documentation and is used to generate dexter.html.xsl which styles the documentation pages.  View the source for dexter.html and scan for attributes in the dx and dd namespaces; they have been been extensively commented. To see the resulting stylesheet applied, refer to any of the documents listed on the right under links such as the User Guide </p>

<p>For more detailed information about descriptor in the dx namespace refer to  User Guide#Dexterity. </p>

<p>Operations in the dd namespace are documented under  User Guide#Didi.</p>

 title : The maxygen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project comprises a system for documenting Max/MSP patches which generates Doxygen-compatible files and ultimately Doxygen-generated documentation (in HTML, rtf, etc). </p>

<p>Mac only, Max 4.6 only at present. </p>

<p>This is around beta-level software: it is working but due to Max 5&#39;s release its development has been paused. It will be being used for another project in Sep 2008 so a release should be expected around then. </p>

<p>In the meantime you would need to compile the libmaxygen (JNI) project and place the libmaxygen.jnilib in /Library/Java/Extensions. The &#39;maxygen&#39; Java package would need to go in your MXJ-Java classpath. </p>

<p>To configure Dosygen, the following is recommended: </p>

<p>Set the &#39;working directory&#39; to the directory containing your Max patcher and its maxygen-generated files. Set OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to the same directory (although you could easily put it somewhere else) this creates html sub-directories (and rtf if enabled etc.) Add this same directory to the INPUT directory list. Add this same directory to the IMAGE_PATH directory list. Add &#39;mxt&#39;, &#39;txt&#39;, &#39;help&#39; to the list of file patterns. I recommend using the maxygen.css included with the example/help file (as this wraps line endings better than the default where there are very long lines of code) do this via HTML_STYLESHEET. I recommend outputting only html (many of the maxygen features only take advantage of this format at present). You can use the Doxyfile included as a starting point but you would need to update ALL of the path settings above.</p>

 title : The sucrose Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IMPORTANT - THE LMS API HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN - READ BELOWWelcome to SucroseSucrose features: </p>

<p> Ability to download all your information from the Neumont LMS  Ability to import tasks into your Outlook 2007 calendar  Ability to notify you of new grades and their affect on your class grade  Ability to attach task documents to your Outlook tasks  Ability to download support documents for each class </p>

<p>Sucrose sits in your system tray and, at an interval you choose, downloads your LMS information and imports it into Outlook. </p>

<p>Sucrose is an open source project based on the SLMS library. The largest portion of Sucrose is in SucroseBase, a library built around the SLMS that converts all a user&#39;s LMS information into in-memory objects. The base also allows for the operation with Outlook 2007. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>News9/4/08 - Neumont LMS API Taken DownDue to a massive number of requests from Sucrose bringing down the LMS, Neumont has taken down the LMS API. This is perhaps not that critical, as only 2 weeks are left in the quarter and next quarter we will be using Moodle anyway. I plan to write a Moodle API, but for the next few weeks, you are on your own. </p>

<p>Sorry for no warning, but I hadn&#39;t received one either. </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>8/8/08 - Sucrose 4.1.2 ReleasedJust one day after 4.1.1, 4.1.2 fixes a critical bug in Sucrose that makes it impossible to download documents for some users. Upgrading is strongly recommended. </p>

<p>Sucrose will again be at the Peak Challenge. Come by and show your support! </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>8/7/08 - Sucrose 4.1.1 ReleasedThis update fixes a couple bothersome errors - namely it adds a newline after the turn in link so that outlook treats it as a hyperlink and url-encoded logins so that special characters can be used in your LMS login. </p>

<p>Some more logging has been added in an attempt to track down the bug that prevents some from downloading files. </p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>6/5/08 - Sucrose 4.1.0 Final Released4.1.0 is now available as promised. Several fixes from the betas are present, as well as a few nice new features, including a link to turn in an assignment on every task. </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>6/1/08 - Sucrose 4.1.0 Beta ReleasedThe highly anticipated 4.1 is almost here. Download the Beta, but beware that some issues may exist. Please report any you encounter. Check back here for the final release sometime this week. </p>

<p>I will also be working on updating the Wiki to help potential contributors to understand the project. Please remember that Sucrose source code and documentation is included in the install, and is also available from the SVN repository. </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>5/31/08 - Sucrose 4.1.0 Nearly ReadyI know this version is highly anticipated. New features include: </p>

<p>A new architecture for building off Sucrose and opening possibilities for output to programs other than outlook. New threading techniques that should reduce the number of runtime errors Passwords are now remembered through the new SLMS (RLMS re-write) Task description documents are now downloaded and attached to tasks Support documents are downloaded too and many more... </p>

<p>I expect to release a beta for this version in the beginning of next week, and a final release will happen before the quarter is over (June 20). </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>3/13/08 - Sucrose 4.0.0 ReleasedSucrose version 4.0.0 has just been released in anticipation of the Peak Challenge tomorrow. Come out and vote! </p>

<p>Some improvements over the beta: </p>

<p>Grade reports now give an estimated grade and a strict grade Memory usage should be lower, as image sizes are much lower Status messages now display what Sucrose is doing, rather than a fraction Logging has been turned on Some input control was added New grades now show as unread in Outlook </p>

<p>-Brian Henk </p>

<p>3/10/08 - Sucrose Beta ReleasedAfter hundreds of hours of work, Sucrose 4 Beta is now available to download. Get it under featured downloads or on the downloads page. With the beta though, comes a warning: Don&#39;t expect perfection. All fixable known bugs have been fixed, and I now want to get an idea of everyone&#39;s experience before release. Please submit an issue if you encounter one. </p>

<p>Final release still scheduled for: 3/14/08 </p>

 summary : <p>This project is a public searching of class availability web application for the up coming semester at University of Hawaii (UH).   </p>

<p>Issues: </p>

<p>Currently, the class availability web application at UH does not give students the capability to search for classes by attributes and other criteria. This is the current class availability web application at UH http://myuh.hawaii.edu/uhdad/avail.classes </p>

<p>Primary users: </p>

<p>Students </p>

<p>Solutions: </p>

<p>Search capabilities will allow courses to be displayed by attributes associated to each class.  Examples of attributes included but not limited to department, time, day, WI, as well as any other core requirements needed for graduation.  The search result will display courses specified and class seat  availability. The application is built using Ajax framework.  The use of Ajax will lessen the server load as well as user wait time, and give the overall site a “tech savvy” look. </p>

<p>Technologies used: </p>

<p>Web Server: Jakarta Tomcat 5.0.28 Windows Server Enterprise Edition  Oracle and MS SQL 2005 database server. Google Web Toolkit framework to build an Ajax application. A Screen shot of the project </p>

 title : The daily-spent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Daily Spent(DS) is an open source software project that intends to be a simple way on counting daily spent, showing statistics, graphs, many consult options, categorization(labels), payment modes etc, with a simple web-based user interface. </p>

<p>The Daily Spent has an important difference characteristics from other projects: it focus only on user daily spent(all things we pay per day, like food, gifts, gas and other stuffs) and has only the minimal elements for this propose, like an simple web-based interface with users login, labels for spent and payment modes. This method bring to us a more accurate view from our spent, since we write down all things we pay, even the schedule spent. We can think on Daily Spent as a PSP(Personal Software Process) software for spent/money. </p>

<p>Some screenshotsHere are some screenshots detailing some Daily Spent features. </p>

<p>ds main page </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At point 1 we can see the spent&#39;s list with the ultimate inserted spent. Note that the amount of spent items at first page can be customized. At point 2 we have a column with some kind of spent category. Point 3 show us the spent payment modes, like money, credit card, and so on. </p>

<p>The point 4 shows a simple menu. Through this menu we can do actions like insert spent, search for spent using a customized filter, or see the statistics for the current spent list in the screen(see the next screenshot). This menu is followed by a search field, that is a shortcut for searching spent. At point 5 we have a more elaborated menu. With that we can customize our user account or generate some backup data(database dump, CSV export/import). </p>

<p>ds statistics page </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The statistics result is generated according to category items and payment items and the total amount of spent. </p>

<p>Technical aspectsThe Daily Spent software is build using free/open source software. More specifically, DS uses Python as programming language, SQLAlchemy to object/relational mapping, Cherrypy to serves the web application and Cheetah as template engine. The database software, to organize the data, can any of then supported by SQLAlchemy (see the list).</p>

 summary : <p>ExegeticaIn a nutshell, I have envisioned Exegetica to include a comprehensive set of collaborative Bible study tools for user-created study groups online. Notes and other group- or user-generated content can be selectively shared or hidden from the public or other groups. A &quot;supergroup&quot; of sorts could also be created in which all subgroups shared common notes and resources. </p>

<p>The basic scripture database has been implemented; however, this project has yet to gain any serious traction. </p>

<p>Feature Ideas include: </p>

<p>Inductive Bible study tools (based off the Precept inductive Bible study method) Marking and highlighting for any group of characters or phrases Dynamically created discussion feature for any of the marked or highlighted content Commentary system If you are interested in contributing to this project, please e-mail the lead developer at exegetica-at-gmail-dot-com. </p>

<p>A word from the Lead Developer:My name is Brian Bowden, and I am a senior in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. My concentration is in Scientific Applications, and I am preparing to attend the university&#39;s Graduate School of Computational Engineering. I have spent several years as a high school geek and college student developing web applications, and I wanted to develop a project that would be fun, educational, and benefit my fellow believers in Christ. Any assistance with this project will be welcomed. Just like most others who develop open source software, I have work that takes priority over this project. However, if interest is shown in furthering this project&#39;s development, I will devote as much time as possible to help those who have also donated time and effort.</p>

 title : The ffdkp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FFdkp is a branch of the EQdkp project version 1.3.2f.  The branch is done due to the staggering differences between Final Fantasy XI and other MMORPGs.  The goal is to evolve FFdkp into a full Linkshell (guild) management system, rather than just a points tracking system. </p>

<p>A new release candidate will be posted soon, version 0.1.4.  Several bugfixes are included as well as new functionality.  Item Stats are now incorporated to the system, with the data being stored in the local db.  The reason to decide on the local db storage had to do with not wanting to rely on external sites changing their display/search methods and impacting existing FFdkp systems.  Also included is some updates to the database to improve performance.  The upgrade process is being completely overhauled as well, including administrative login protection. </p>

<p>Future plans: </p>

<p>Release 0.3 - Raid/event planning and scheduling, zone/event access tracking and database performance related fixes Release 0.5 - Customizable views for every page (editable under admin tasks) and db query improvements (more use of database views instead of common complex queries) Release 0.7 - Full integration of security updates from EQdkp 1.4.x Release 0.9 - User/Member linking allows editing of new user information (craft skills, possessed gear, etc.) including admin ability to restrict/allow all user specific information to be edited by the user. Release 1.0 - All outstanding bugs to be fixed, HTML and code cleanup. </p>

<p>For all feature requests and bugs, open an issue.  I will be updating them more often as they are fixed (they are checked on a regular basis, just frequently looked at, details obtained and nothing past it). </p>

<p>If you happened to notice, the logos are very generic looking right now as I am not an artist.  If anyone would like to contribute css styles and/or logos to be included, they will be included in the project.</p>

 title : The mtm-online Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The virtual sewing services company has identified a business opportunity in the online order of “made to measure” clothing. The site will offer the services of a team of seamstresses. Customers will be able to browse various garments, choose matching fabrics, enter personal body measurement information and make an order for a unique garment. In addition to the basic e-commerce functionality the site will appeal to users with a fully incorporated dressing widget that will assist and diversify the shopping experience. Considering the relatively small size of a potential sewing business, it was decided that the services of a payment service provider would be used for the checkout process. Also, the application will not implement a full order processing system, but will use the system provided by the chosen PSP(s). The administration interface aims to make company processes more efficient. A simple workload planning algorithm will allocate incoming work automatically to employees. A bare bone backend administration interface will allow for the upload of new products. This is for a university Group Project module.</p>

 title : The phpmyflat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>phpMyFlatImportant NewsI decided to change the database from flat, text-files to xml-files. So this is going to be a xml-database. The name will probably change to phpMyXML. </p>

<p>The General StuffLike phpMyAdmin this is a database administration tool. Except this is for a flatfile database. </p>

<p>This is really two projects in one. First I am developing the flatfile database and then the database administration tool. </p>

<p>The syntax in the flatfile database will be exactly as in mysql or at least as close as it can be. Here is an example of a working function: </p>

<p>SELECT category FROM table(| ORDER BY (ASC|DESC))Execution in PHP at this time at least looks like this: </p>

<p>// Gets the database handling information from flatdb.php
<br/>require(&quot;flatdb.php&quot;);
<br/>// We name the database so the script knows where to look
<br/>$databasename = &quot;first&quot;;
<br/>// We now send a query to the script which will in return parse it and send us a result
<br/>$echome = myflat_query(&quot;SELECT model FROM cars ORDER BY ASC&quot;);
<br/>// The result it got was an array so we have to count the rows for the while loop
<br/>$rays = count($echome) - 1;
<br/>// Executing simple while loop
<br/>$i = 0;
<br/>while ($i , which are actually columns in the flatfiles, are stored in a separate flatfile, this is actually for my convenience only but it doesnt make the script a lot slower so no problem.</p>

 summary : <p>The whole core of WeboW is being redeveloped in order to optimize and make easier it to implement new functions or manage them, even for those who intent to modify it for Ascent Servers (though after Mangos version is completed, i might do it myself). </p>

<p>This will take much time, so i will be less able to support you. </p>

<p>Installation: Installation interface will remain the same. However, more helping informations will be added to the interface. A feature &quot;Reinstall&quot;; might also be implemented. </p>

<p>Updates: The new versions of WeboW will not come under SVN. Instead there will be a function for administrators to update it both mysql and files directly from a website (later i will tell which). Files will NOT be merged, so whatever changes you made, they might be replaced on future updates. </p>

<p>Templates You can now add personalized templates to your WeboW. You wont need to know PHP at all, just HTML (and some of JavaScript to make it more dynamically if you want). Template functions might be override by Add-Ons in order to show the wanted information. There will also be a function Skin if you want to keep the same layout but change the colours/images (that vary from template to template). </p>

<p>Languages The core will remain the same. </p>

<p>Forums Smiles will be added to the core. The rest will remain. </p>

<p>Add-ons Renamed from Modules, will now be a part of the core, allowing to change it almost totally. </p>

 title : The appwrapper-mac Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AppWrapper is a tool to turn web applications into Mac OS X applications. It serves to create site-specific browser applications, called wrappers, as well as to create a platform for web application developers to create integrated versions of their apps for Mac users. </p>

<p>The code is still being prepared for open-source release, and as such no download is available yet. </p>

<p>ApplicationAppWrapper features a simple interface for creating wrappers. Enter the name and URL of a web application, and it will get turned into a regular Mac OS X application. This is done through the use of the Safari-based WebKit framework. </p>

<p>JavaScript/Objective-C Integration FrameworkOne of AppWrapper&#39;s key strengths lies in its JavaScript and Objective-C plugin framework. Developers can use either language to create plugins to interact with the app window&#39;s UI, as well as with the DOM. These can apply globally to all web applications, such as the current Growl notification and Dock badge plugins, or can be applied to specific web sites. This isn&#39;t a JavaScript Cocoa bridge - you can only access plugins exposed to the window. There are, however, some plugins in the planning to expose system wide functionality to JavaScript, such as applying Core Animation effects to the window (and possibly DOM elements themselves). </p>

<p>There is actually a serious amount of power here. For an example, let&#39;s pretend you were writing a wrapper for Gmail, and wanted serious integration with native system UI components. You can create an Objective-C plugin which creates a source list next to the web view, pull all of the user&#39;s labels and contacts into the source list, and remove them from the DOM. There are all kinds of possibilities. We&#39;ll be publishing some developer documentation as well as some example plugins soon. </p>

<p>There are also plans to port the framework to a Safari plugin, bringing this functionality to Safari&#39;s browser at large. However, this is very much future-looking, as the goal is to come up with a rock-solid foundation for plugin development first. </p>

<p>Web Application DevelopersYou can integrate with AppWrapper in two ways. You can simply modify your code to detect when the user is running AppWrapper with JavaScript, and make your integration calls, or you can create your own wrappers for distribution, supplying users with JavaScript/Objective-C plugins created in house. The goal is to make it incredibly easy for web application developers to make wrappers for their own apps. Documentation will be coming soon.</p>

 summary : <p>WARNING: THIS IS INTENDED ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND SOFTWARE RESEARCH PURPOSES. MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT. WHEN DONE IN THE WHOLE OSX SYSTEM, IT&#39;S LIKELY TO PRODUCE SOFTWARE INCOMPATIBILITIES. </p>

<p>SUMMARY:  </p>

<p>In theory, small is good, everything small performs better. An atomic reaction provides more power than a chemical reaction, a nano material will produce an indestructible fabric. So do in software, small applications runs faster, with less consumed memory, and more instances possible. This method of optimization reduces the file size of metadata files through pre-formatting and trimming. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: </p>

<p>XML Optimization is a set of method that reformat the XML metadata for use with XML stream. The process is used in websites to minimize network bandwidth consumption and increase the memory space for the applications who store them locally. XML metadata is used throughout modern OS &amp; Desktops today. (Mac OS X, GNOME/KDE). By Optimizing the XML metadata that those applications use, the application who parse them will require less memory usage, and less time parsing the document, thus improving speed and responsiveness of the applications that use those documents. </p>

<p>By XML Optimization, the metadata will be preformatted, by removing the whitespace between the tags, and compacting the whole XML content into a single line, without making any changes in the data inside the tags. The process will make the file much smaller, giving increased memory space, and increased ease for the xml parser to read it. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS: </p>

<p>Download xml-optimizer.sh script Edit and change the &quot;$start_path&quot; where it would search the XML files. Run the file by typing &quot;sh ./xml-optimizer.sh&quot;</p>

 summary : <p>WebSMSlib is an extensible framework lets you send text messages through carriers&#39; websites without browsing between many pages. WebSMSLib project born as a port of WebSMS Widget (for Mac OS X Dashboard) from JavaScript to Cocoa-ObjectiveC. </p>

<p>Aren’t you tired of opening the web browser, clicking through dozens of redundant pages, filled with useless informations and graphics, typing the recipient’s number by hand, before actually sending an SMS? How many free SMS you didn’t send just because it was damn boring? </p>

<p>At the top of WebSMS library (available under GPL license) I&#39;ve made a GUI application for both Mac OS X and iPhone platform (coming soon). This application is integrated with your Address Book, allows you to create multiple accounts for each service (ie, you can make two accounts for your Vodafone plugin), remember used account for a specific number and finally it&#39;s a real cocoalicious application. </p>

<p>WebSMS is completely free and released under an Open Source license. If you’d like to contribute to the project, write a plugin for an unsupported carrier, make a donation to support development, or just drop a line to suggest a new feature, don’t hesitate to contact me. </p>

 title : The 3dengines Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Here you will find some Quake 3 Arena based projects that I have messed with at one time or another. I am working on a small tactical / deathmatch game simular to COD, MOHAA and so on. Because of this, I&#39;ve checked out multiple Q3A Related Projects such as ioquake3, Xreal and Evolution. </p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE:  These are setup to be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005. Linux and Mac support is not something that I am interested in so most of the code has been removed for these platforms. The rendering engines and additional libraries for my own projects only support Windows at this time. </p>

<p>PAK NOTICE: You will need the pak files from the Quake 3 Demo or OpenArena if you do not own a copy of Quake 3. For ioquake, Checksum checks have been removed so ioquake will now load either standard Quake 3 pak0.pk3 files or will load the pak files of any mods. However, You will more than likely be missing some of the original textures so if you do not own Quake 3, use the OpenArena pak files and install the q3a mods as usual.</p>

 title : The as3mp3streamplayer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The asaudio Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Creation and handling of sounds via a straight-forward, clear and coherent syntax. For example, to create a sound, play it and change its volume: </p>

<p>var track:Track = new Track(&quot;path/to/track.mp3&quot;);
<br/>track.start();
<br/>track.volume = .5;Whereas with the standard API, you would write: </p>

<p>var urlRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(&quot;path/to/track.mp3&quot;);
<br/>var sound:Sound = new Sound(urlRequest);
<br/>var soundChannel:SoundChannel = sound.play();
<br/>var soundTrans:SoundTransform = soundChannel.soundTransform;
<br/>soundTrans.volume = .5;
<br/>soundChannel.soundTransform = soundTrans;Hierarchical sound structures. You can put a bunch of sounds into a Group or a Playlist object and control them globally. For example:   </p>

<p>var group:Group = new Group( [new Track(&quot;path/to/track1.mp3&quot;), new Track(&quot;path/to/track2.mp3&quot;), new Track(&quot;path/to/track3.mp3&quot;)] );
<br/>group.pan = -1;
<br/>group.addChild(new Track(&quot;path/to/track4.mp3&quot;));
<br/>group.start(); You can also put groups into other groups, and thus create complex hierarchical structures. The 4 main structures (Track, Group, Playlist and Mixer) implements a common interface, so for many methods and properties, you can treat every element the same way. </p>

<p>Each navigation/sound transform methods (start(), stop(), mute(), left/right/center(), etc.) has a &quot;fade&quot; option to make smooth sound transitions (tiny internal tween engine, with a single timer) </p>

<p>Efficient memory management. </p>

<p>M3U/XSPF playlists import/export. </p>

<p>Event-driven objects. </p>

 title : The atomicsoundmanipulationlanguage Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Atomic Sound Manipulation Language is Team SoundHammer&#39;s solution to the problem of how to make a high level computer language that describes effects that can be applied to sound waves.  The idea is to give the programmer access to the most elemental levels of a sound&#39;s composition in an easy, intuitive way.  This elemental access to sounds is the idea from which our language derives its name, as we intended the language to operate upon sound at the &quot;atomic&quot; level. </p>

<p>ASML will feature typical computer language constructs such as loops, if statements, comparators, and arithmetic operators. It will use these features to manipulate new primitive types based upon the most fundamental components of sound: frequency, amplitude, and time.  Programmers in ASML will be able to use these statements and operators to produce general purpose and specialized functions to act upon sound waves, their individual frequencies, and other available types.  Programmers will then be able to aggregate these functions into even more robust effects that can be intelligently triggered. 
<br/>Team SoundHammer would like ASML to bring power and ease to the manipulation of sound waves in the same way that a language like AWK makes it easy to write powerful text file manipulation programs.  We would like to have the user be able to use simple commands to open wav files, isolate frequencies and time ranges from those files, and manipulate the data therein on either a micro or a macro scale.</p>

 title : The blip-buffer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Blip_Buffer implements efficient band-limited sound synthesis buffers, allowing high-quality emulation of video game sound chips. After setting the source clock rate and output sampling rate, waveforms are generated by specifying the time points where amplitude changes occur. Treble and bass adjustments are also supported. Many examples are included that show basic waveform generation, sample buffering schemes, and more advanced topics. They can be made to write output to a wave sound file, or optionally use the SDL multimedia library for real-time playback, waveform display, and mouse control of parameters. For a lightweight version written in C, use my blip_buf library.</p>

 title : The chimootimer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryChimoo Timer is a countdown/up timer for Mac OS X featuring speech recognition and text-to-speech support. Give Chimoo Timer a try for all your timing needs! </p>

<p>DetailsIn addition to the main timer window, a mini window, multiplier window (for counting frames per second), and menu extra are also available. Any combination of these can be displayed simultaneously, or you can hide Chimoo Timer&#39;s dock icon and have only the faceless menu extra shown.  Fonts and colors can now be customized on the two larger windows allowing you to create very large timers for distant viewing, or compact timers to conserve screen real estate. The time display can also be customized to display HH:MM:SS, natural language, or seconds only. Fractions of a second can be shown or hidden, and many notification options are available. </p>

<p>Why would I want such a simple timer? Chimoo Timer doesn&#39;t hog your processor - especially when it&#39;s in the background. There are many things a speech recognition timer is handy for. One example is as a stretch/exercise/yoga timer. Enable the speech recognition, set the countdown to an appropriate number such as thirty seconds, and then you can control the timer with your voice from the floor across the room - no buttons needed. When the timer expires, simply say &quot;start timer&quot; again and it will begin counting down again. Curious how much time is left? Ask the timer - &quot;current value&quot; - and it will read you the remaining time. If the room you are in becomes too noisy for speech recognition, you can even tell the timer to turn it off by saying &quot;disable speech recognition.&quot; </p>

 summary : <p>This is a rhythm game that uses a dance mat as primary input device.  The game plays a song, and the player moves on the mat in time to the beat.  This happens within two different game mode: Free play and Challenge.  Challenge mode trains players dance step combinations and then challenges them to repeat them as they&#39;re called out.  Free play mode allows for unstructured play: the player can dance however he or she wants and still earn points for hitting beats.  Players in Free Play mode can mix in combinations as desired to earn extra points.  Players will also have the opportunity to import their favorite music into the game.</p>

 title : The myriad3d Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis is my test engine using Irrlicht as its rendering component. This is my first 3D application so &#39;best practices&#39; are still being learned along the way. By no means is this the best engine or design, I make no claim--this is more of proof of concept a way to iron out design decisions. That being said it is likely the code will change dramatically from commit to commit. And since this is a hobby project I may start on one feature and get bored with it and move to another leaving that feature for a later date. </p>

<p>Some background information about this project, it spawned from my previous project--palisma2d which was a 2d engine with a slim game on top of it. Most of the code has been ported to this engine, thus I call it an engine/code base. If you have questions or would like to contribute please feel free to contact me. I am very busy with life at the moment so a helping hand is always welcome. Or you can just email me and tell me I&#39;m an idiot for this or that. </p>

 title : The silabsradiodll Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Silabs radio is a cheap USB FM Radio with RDS facilities. This project provides a DLL that makes it easy for you to utilize the radio and RDS functions in your own project. Example VB6 code is supplied. </p>

<p>It&#39;s supported in the FreeICE front end and with RoadRunner in a very limited fashion at the moment, but possibly in full capacity in future. </p>

<p>This currently supports the Silabs reference radio and ADSTech Instant FM. If you have an alternative vendor with a Silabs radio chipset, then please email me your VID and PID code for inclusion, as well as the name of the Audio device. You can then help test to see if it works. </p>

<p>I&#39;m told that the Brando radio works, but with no RDS. It&#39;s the same with PCear - no RDS &amp; also with bad audio quality. However, these radios are still useful for AF &amp; TA purposes. I can use them as a 2nd tuner to check signal strength before we change frequency on the main radio. </p>

<p>Visit the Digital Car UK Forums for further details or to chat with the developer. My tag is &quot;Beezer&quot; and Guino is also contributing, so feel free to chat to him about this. </p>

<p>Contact:  Gerd Liefländer   Lecturers:  Prof. Dr. Frank Bellosa, Gerd Liefländer   Tutors:  Atanas Dimitrov, Yana Nedyalkova, Simon Echle, Daniel Höllig   Term:  Summer 2007  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>ContentsStudents interested in operating systems study how to tackle system related problems. Furthermore, students can learn how to program small and medium sized systems in Java. We focus on problems concerning concurrent processes especially on those with potential race conditions. Besides some wellknown concurrency problems like the dining philosopher-, the N-buffer, the producer-/consumer-, the reader-/writer-problem more application oriented competition problems will be discussed. </p>

<p>OrganizationProgramming, testing, and demonstrating the experimental results can be done in our lab (room 149). Every two weeks we will have a meeting in the Multimediahörsaal (-102). Students can discuss the basic design and implementation problems and they can present their intermediate and final results. The intended experiments shouldn&#39;t take more than two or three hours per week per participant. Along with each experiment we will hand out a description of the experiment, i.e. a guideline how to proceed step by step. We expect that each team will document all their intermediate series of tests. </p>

<p>Preliminary MeetingDuring the preliminary meeting we will fix the dates, arrange the groups, and talk about organizing details. If you have still questions about the course, please contact: Mr. Dipl.-Math. G. Liefländer, Room 160, Building 50.34, E-Mail: liefatira.uka.de</p>

 summary : <p>This project is a complete open source replica  of Vector-06C (Russian: Вектор-06Ц), a retro, Soviet-era home computer, in a FPGA. If you&#39;re new to this, fpga4fun is a good place to start learning. </p>

<p>Altera DE1 development board with Cyclone II FPGA is the primary development platform.  </p>

<p>The project uses a mixture of Verilog and VHDL code. All original code is written in Verilog, while some of the modules, e.g. T80 CPU and 82C55 PIO controller are written in VHDL. </p>

<p>This version of T80 is the most accurate implementation of 8080 to date. The complete set of 8080 Exerciser test results matches that of the real CPU. </p>

<p>Make sure to browse the Wiki, GettingStarted is a nice place to start. Also check out the videos of work in progress. Returning users please check Revision_History page for news. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Этот проект полностью воссоздает цветной компьютер Вектор-06Ц без зеленых конденсаторов. Весь компьютер, включая процессор и дисковод, помещается в одной микросхеме ПЛИС, а его структура и поведение описаны на языках Verilog и VHDL. Если вы не знаете, что это такое, но хотите узнать, сходите на fpga4fun. </p>

<p>Проект разрабатывается на плате Altera DE1. Часть кода заимствована из других открытых проектов. В частности, использованы ядра T80 CPU, 82C55.  </p>

<p>Используемая в этом проекте версия процессора T80 является самой точной на сегодняшний день реализацией процессора КР580ВМ80А. 100% результатов теста  8080 Exerciser  совпадают с полученными на настоящем процессоре данными. </p>

 title : The wordlisttrainer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Word List Trainer is a tool for foreign language learning. A frequently used technique when learning words is to use tables with the words in the mother language in one of the columns and the foreign words in the other. Word List Trainer makes it easy to create this kind of tables and to attach sounds to the words. The word lists can be exported to sound files that can be downloaded to e.g. mp3 players. It is possible to save the word lists in either a local database or a network database and to copy the word lists to and from the databases. This is a handy functionality when students are studying together and are learning the same words.   </p>

 summary : <p>Console is a Flash  Actionscript 3 debugger/logger for flash, flex and AIR. It runs in the same flash you want to use logging on or use remoting to print logs on a flash remote (running on AIR / EXE / swf / swf in html - your choice).  </p>

<p>The main advantage of console is that you can password protect and hide the console during beta / user testing stage of your flash project. This gives developers the ability to go into console on-site and see the traces. No special browser or player version is required to use.  Console gives you access to flash objects and properties via commandLine, so narrowing down bugs, manipulating properties and variables can be very easy. Console can also track objects to see if they have been garbage collected during run time. </p>

<p>See ReadMe for requirements and changes log. </p>

<p>See GettingStarted wiki for basic usages. </p>

<p>Main features:Channels Priorities with colour code Command line, - lets you read/write/execute any methods and properties; inspect object/classes; print map of DisplayObjects. etc Garbage collection monitor, - notifies you when objects of your interest are being garbage collected. Ruler tool RL - Measure distances/degrees on screen Roller tool Ro - lists display map of what&#39;s under your mouse pointer Graph reporting numeric values Password protect-able Remote logging (now also as Adobe AIR) Other features:Trace in non-repetitive mode Build in FPS and memory monitor Key binding to functions Text filtering/search Move / resize during run time Customizable UI Keep it self always on top  Easy to remove when no longer needed Demo:Demo Console: http://www.luaye.com/flash_console/ Demo Remote Console: http://www.luaye.com/flash_console/remote.html To test the remote, open the normal console link and send messages to console to see that remote console also recieve the updates.

 summary : <p>Flash Tones lets you create ‘music’ by moving around in front of your webcam. Movement on the X axis controls pitch, and the Y axis controls volume. When movement occurs the difference in pixels is calculated, which is used to drive the pitch and volume. The color of those pixels represent the location of the movement along the x axis. The white blurred squares also show the location of the movement by changing their z depth based on how close they are to the center of the movement. </p>

 summary : <p>Vizzy Flash TracerVizzy Flash Tracer is a debugging tool for flash developers which lets you read all the &quot;trace&quot; statements of SWF files without adding any extra code! It works in Firefox, IE, Flash IDE, Adobe AIR and other places where &quot;trace&quot; statements take place. Vizzy is cross platform and has all the features other tracers have and even more. </p>

<p>Vizzy runs out-of-the-box and configures your environment for you to start debugging your flash applications immediately (automatic mm.cfg file creation, determining location, debug flash player detection, etc.)Download the latest build from Downloads section. </p>

 title : The agunitframes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A unit frame addon, written using object oriented development techniques from Ace2. It applies its layout from a theme table, allowing for great flexibility for users wishing to customize their unit frames.</p>

<p>The history of this unit frame addon goes back quite some time, actually. The idea was born out of a frame addon called MiniGroup, developed by jaslaughter. This eventually spawned MiniGroup2 and another developer started to step in to the picture to take it over: drewkeller. Drewkeller started to become busy with other projects and that is where AndreasG (ag) enters the picture to continue development on that project. As the code behind MiniGroup2 was getting larger and, in some ways, more cumbersome to both expand and keep bugfree, a rewrite was started utilizing Ace2. Ag_UnitFrames was born! While essentially a completely new unit frame from the ground up, much of the frame design and features are based on MiniGroup, to which all the developers and original creators are owed a big &#39;thank you!&#39;</p>

 title : The egocentric Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In this project, we attempted an approach to path planning based on our own innovative expandable circular egocentric map. The map, composed of neurons, is capable of varying its coverage through adjustment of a weight factor. Through activations of the neurons in the map, we find that our autonomous agents can adequately perform crowd and obstacle avoidance. We also implemented attention control, which react naturally to both dynamic and static objects in the environment. </p>

<p>1.1	Source of Inspiration </p>

<p>The role of artificial intelligence in gaming has seen an exponential rise over the last few years. With the scope of games growing larger and larger with every new release, it is not uncommon for gamers to find themselves immersed in large scale environments with hundreds and thousands of non playing characters.  </p>

<p>The importance of these, ‘not so important’ characters come to the fore in order for a gamer to lose him or herself in a game. Life-like steering motions of these characters thus become quintessential for a truly immersive gaming experience.  </p>

<p>This paper presents a novel technique that makes use of multi-layered Egocentric Spatial Maps for steering and path planning of autonomous agents. Under this implementation, agents can navigate themselves in dynamically changing environments performing collision avoidance around static as well as dynamic objects. For attention control, the implementation was based on Gazenet architecture. With this, each agent has a head which can respond accordingly to objects in the environment as well. </p>

<p>The implementation of this technique is carried out under the OpenSteer framework which is an open source C++ library that aids in the construction of steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation.</p>
 title : The fb-virtual-libs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Library project for FreeBASICThe main problem that I was looking at was as to why FreeBASIC, being the excellent programming language that it is, didn&#39;t have very many libraries or headers for some of the nice 3D-gaming engines and virtual-reality systems out there. There are already some very powerful primitives for some of the low-level graphics handling, but none, as far as I saw of any, for the rendering libraries, texturing, and VR landscaping. This presented something of a problem as I chose to use FreeBASIC as my preferred coding base, and would like to see FreeBASIC as a coding base for use in today&#39;s stunning 3D VR games! 
<br/>Therefore, I have decided to start working on some of my own bindings and adaptations. I would like to see me being able to easily incorporate engines like NEBULA, OGRE, PhysX, and the like without a lot of the headaches! 
<br/>I eventually hope to bring out a mature project to help implement &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot; capabilities to FreeBASIC as it is one of few &quot;BASICs&quot; out there that have OOP programming paradigm. The FreeBASIC folks are doing a wonderful job with the constant updates and improvements to FreeBASIC and the development tools. I just would like to see something of a version that could be easily and seamlessly adapted to the programming of high-performance graphics and game authoring. This may translate into a separate project as I do not wish to cause the drastic alteration of the original FreeBASIC projects. 
<br/>So I wish to first just start the process of producing a good, solid collection of library headers of some common 3D packages and put together a consistent package of my own together. 
<br/> This project has officially started the research phase on: 08-28-2008.  </p>

<p>I would also like to add that I am comparing engines and supporting libraries to find what will work best for me for the time being. But I will try to put together several different recommend lists so as to add a little variety for others. I also plan on putting together a features comparison chart so that others can see what will work for them and their projects.  For this, stay tuned.  </p>

 title : The fgp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ferret is a java-based implementation of Ferret Gaming Protocol, an in-development TCP-based network protocol that is aimed at supplanting contemporary bloated and buggy online gaming applications. </p>

<p>The goal of Ferret is to be agile, slim, and playful - hence the name, Ferret. When completed, Ferret will provide what is essentially a classical chat interface, with an extensible framework of additional utilities, such as dice rolling, file sharing, and a &quot;battlemat&quot; supporting icons, maps, a &quot;Fog of War&quot;, and free-hand drawing. </p>

<p>At the time of this writing, Ferret is not usable. It is merely a pet project aimed at ironing out the details of the open Ferret Gaming Protocol (FGP). While Ferret is intended to be the showcase for FGP, the ultimate goal is to have other projects develop more feature-rich environments to extend on FGP, which is why FGP is being designed from the ground-up as highly extensible.</p>

 summary : <p>Russian-&gt;English translators are welcome! </p>

<p>Перестали устраивать стандартные возможности стандартных программ? Хочется немного скорректировать вид и поведение без изучения кучи непонятного кода и перекомпиляции исходников? Есть желание написать свою аську за двадцать минут, в которой будет устраивать абсолютно все? Добро пожаловать в 4x4! </p>

<p>Проект 4x4 - эксперимент по созданию среды разработки и выполнения программного обеспечения с открытой внутренней архитектурой.  </p>

<p>Приложения системы 4x4 - ZIP-архивы, содержащие в себе набор XML, JavaScript, графику и все другое, необходимое для работы. При инсталляции приложения разархивируется в требуемые папки на локальном диске. Обязательных мест инсталляции не предусмотрено, пользователь волен решать сам, куда ставить ему свои приложения. Приложения имеют четкую структуру, зная которую даже не подготовленный пользователь может легко разобраться в любом приложении и скорректировать его под свои конкретные нужды. Приложения не содержат в себе никакого машинного кода, они кросс-платформенны. Весь машинно-зависимый код расположен в библиотеках. </p>

<p>Библиотеки системы 4x4 - ZIP-архивы, содержащие в себе набор бинарных файлов под целевую архитектуру процессора, плюс все остальные файлы, требуемые библиотекой. Путь установки библиотеки выбирается системой автоматически, пользователь не может повлиять на этот процесс. Возможно одновременная установка и использование нескольких версий одноименного модуля. Корректировка библиотек самим пользователем не допускается. Новые версии модулей автоматически подгружаеются из сети в ответ на требования устанавливаемых приложений.  </p>

<p>Библиотеки 4x4 предоставляют весь функционал, необходимый для построения приложений. Различные протоколы, обработка графики, видео звука и т.д. - все это может быть использовано в приложениях 4x4 путем подключения соответствующих библиотек, которые в первом приближении будут содержать в себе стандартные UNIX библиотеки + обертки для использования их из JavaScript. </p>

<p>Визуальный интерфейс 4x4 реализуется на базе технологии SVG + специального XML-диалекта иерерхических настроек. Интерфейс гибко расширяем конечным пользователем, который волен доработать приложение по своему вкусу, особо не вникая в его исходный код. </p>

<p>Проект находится на стадии планирования. Любые вопросы и пожелания приветствуются в списке рассылки. Особо приветствуются люди, желающие принять участие в кодинге.</p>

 title : The javascriptdesktop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a graphical desktop system, written in Javascript, with a server backend written in Perl. It is meant for remote system administration. It let&#39;s you manage and edit your files in a user-friendly GUI environment, inside your browser.</p>

<p>It is not a very mature piece of software yet, and it has numerous bugs and issues with bugs in browsers, but it works, after a fashion. Any outside contributions to the development of this would be warmly welcome, as I don&#39;t currently have much time to work on it.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular download, it also features a Perl self-installer, which you can just upload to your site and run as a CGI script.</p>

<p>This project is essentially dead due to lack of time. It is quite a neat piece of code, however, and if anyone wants to adopt it and develop it, I&#39;m open for it. Mail me, or post in the discussion thread.</p>

 title : The periscope Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ubuntu users, please use the repository so that updates will be pushed to you. </p>

<p>Presentationperiscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that tries to find a correct match for a given video file. The goal behind periscope is that it will only return only correct subtitles so that you can simply relax and enjoy your video without having to double-check that the subtitles match your video before watching it. </p>

<p>This is done by using as much info as available from your file and on the websites. Some websites allow you to use hash of the files, the size/length of the video or the exact file name. </p>

<p>As a python module, periscope should be easily integrated in many projects that allow plugins to be written in python. The fact that the plugin is shared between all the applications means that separate application and their plugin (file browser, video player, media center application, ...) don&#39;t have to maintain the code to search, parse and download subtitles and the user preference about languages. </p>

<p>The subtitles websites are handled as plugins and currently support : </p>

<p>OpenSubtitles.org SubtitleSource.org Podnapisi.net Subscene.com Subtitulos.es </p>

<p>     </p>

<p>InstallationUbuntuFor Ubuntu users, you can add the repository for periscope in Synaptic. All information are located on the Wiki: http://code.google.com/p/periscope/wiki/UbuntuRepository </p>

<p>DebianI believe the Ubuntu package should be installable on Debian unstable. </p>

<p>From source codeYou can checkout the code. The setup.py is included in SVN. </p>

<p>UsageYou can use the module with a CLI by doing </p>

<p>$ periscope  -l en
<br/>$ periscope  -l en -l frto search subtitles in english, replace &#39;en&#39; by &#39;fr&#39;, &#39;de&#39; or whatever language you would like your subtitles in. Note : Brazilian Portuguese is written as &quot;pt-br&quot;, Argentinian Spanish is written as &quot;es-ar&quot;. </p>

<p>You can also use periscope in Nautilus by following the instructions on the wiki page </p>

<p>RequirementsAs of version 0.1.7 </p>

<p>You will need Python (&gt;= 2.6, &lt; 3.0) to run periscope. You will also need the python module beautifulsoup to parse html pages. An executable unrar command could be needed for some plugins </p>

<p>Screenshot(s)Nautilus IntegrationA Nautilus plugin exists to integrate periscope in Nautilus: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Changes0.1.8.1 * Fixes the language from the config file
<br/> * Fixes Podnapisi support
<br/> * Various bugfixes0.1.7 * support for subscene.com and subtitulos.es
<br/> * CLI shows a report at the end0.1.6 * bugfixes0.1.5 * use queues to query the websites so that the queries run in parallel
<br/> * updated code for podnapisi
<br/> * updated code for OpenSubtitles.org
<br/> * package for persicope-gnome (currently only right-click in Nautilus)0.1.4 * use freedesktop.org config system to choose the language
<br/> * use the API for SubtitleSource.org</p>

 summary : <p>ASP代表了一个过去了的时代。我们目前所能做的就是把它相关的一切整理起来，打好行李包，一起去面对长途跋涉的未来。或者是死亡，或者是新生。又有什么能够永恒呢?知足常乐。 </p>

<p>ASP(Active Server Pages)是一套由微软公司开发的(IIS自带的)服务器端运行的脚本平台，使用ASP内置组件(组件由开发专家们根据动态网页最常用的功能而开发)可以结合HTML网页、ASP指令和Active X元件快速开发动态网页。ASP本意指一个开发环境，ASP也支持VBScript和JScript等多种脚本语言，默认为VBScript。其中JScript是微软公司的ECMAScript标准的实现，并且有自己的扩展。但通常人们把ASP等同于VBScript脚本语言。  </p>

<p>ASP并非是语法优美或者技术先进的脚本语言，甚至被认为是俗气落魄，但是它却以微软一贯的最易学较好用和强大的市场运作而在国内成为最普及的脚本语言。ASP以其简单，开发周期短，易维护的优点受到中小型商务站点管理员的青睐。</p>
 title : The atom-php-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project contains set of php 5 classes for development of custom gdata like custom REST servers based on HTTP and XML - ATOM. </p>

<p>Idea is to create custom extension based on this framework to develop custom REST API for a custom webservice. I&#39;ll tend to provide sample extensions for well known php web applications. </p>

<p>Inspiration is definitively google set of apis based on gdata format and protocol. There are many client libraries to use these apis. On the other hand, currently there are no classes (at least not for php) which could be helpful to achieve similar goal and develop custom gdata/atom server. </p>

<p>MVC frameworks were also in mind although View component is quite different than what you have with cake, codeigniter and similar. </p>

<p>Developer: Milan Rukavina</p>
 summary : <p>Web 2.0 (AJAX) web-application written on PHP uses XAJAX modules. The idea of this project - create &quot;browser operation system&quot; (Web 2.0 OS) or somthing looked like it and try to create most of modern os applications like: notepad, mailer, office, chat. This project is a good platform for a internet shops, forums, blogs ets. I try to make &quot;look and work&quot; application with &quot;help inside&quot; feature. The brunch of this project is Integrated Intranet Commander. It has the simple GUI like in most file managers (2 panels, buttons ets). With IIFileSystem it will able to integrate http and ftp servers and create united file interface. At all it&#39;ll be like file forum for software developers but not only for them - for all people who work at home.

 title : The guardachuva Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ApresentaçãoO projeto Guarda-Chuva tem como objetivo desenvolver um Sistema Gerenciador de Conteúdo (CMS - Content Management System) Open Source, de forma que seja possível sua adaptação a qualquer projeto de sistemas de informação desenvolvido em PHP. </p>

<p>O projeto tem foco nos Trabalhos de Conclusão de Curso (TCC´s) dos alunos da UnP - Universidade Potiguar, sobretudo no desenvolvimento das atividades de orientação aos TCCs do curso de Sistemas de Informação. Detectamos uma tendência de não implantação e utilização dos projetos nas empresas parceiras ao final dos TCC´s. Entendemos que esse problema decorre da impossibilidade de um ou dois alunos produzirem software de qualidade, em função da quantidade de processos e de artefatos que devem ser produzidos para a construção de softwares dentro dos padrões exigidos pela indústria. Além disso, o mercado, a cada dia, cria novos requisitos, que impactam diretamente no prazo de desenvolvimento do sofware. Podemos citar como exemplo, os requisitos de acessibilidade recomendados pelo W3C, a independência de plataformas com o uso de aparelhos celulares para consultas a Internet, AJAX entre outros. </p>

<p>Além dos problemas de entrega e implantação do sistema, há ainda, a falta de suporte e manutenção por parte dos alunos. Não se pode exigir que os alunos se comprometam com a manutenção do sistema ao longo do seu ciclo de vida. A empresa parceira depois encontra dificuldade para conseguir mão-de-obra capaz de prestar suporte e manutenção para o software desenvolvido. A falta de padrões no código, a ausência de gerenciamento e a pouca experiência no desenvolvimento inviabiliza qualquer possibilidade de manutenção do software por outros desenvolvedores.  </p>

<p>Caso nosso projeto alcance os objetivos esperados, produziremos mão-de-obra capaz de dar manutenção às aplicações desenvolvidas por outros alunos, e, dessa forma, as empresas parceiras teriam oferta de mão-de-obra para dar continuidade aos projetos iniciados na UnP. </p>

<p>A ArquiteturaPretendemos construir uma arquitetura aberta (open source) utilizando várias bibliotecas desenvolvidas pela comunidade de software livre. Não há nenhuma novidade na utilização de bibliotecas de terceiros, contudo, para tornar mais fácil o aprendizado e a utilização dessas bibliotecas, pretendemos criar classes que irão traduzir os métodos(originariamente desenvolvidos em inglês) para o português. A arquitetura utilizará os princípios da Prototipagem: </p>

<p>Mostrar resultados (parciais) ao clinte de forma rápida Mudanças necessárias são discutidas mais rapidamente O refinamento do protótipo acontece até que o cliente esteja satisfeito com o software </p>

<p>Prototipagem EvolutivaEm resumo, as técnicas e ferramentas de software,  existem para auxiliar o levantamento de requisitos de um sistema e  auxiliar a equipe de desenvolvimento a atender a esses requisitos. Mesmo com todas as técnicas e ferramentas, é bastante comum a compreensão equivocada e incompleta dos requisitos levantados, além disso há uma constante mudança nos requisitos já levantados, mesmo durante a fase de desenvolvimento e implantação, a mudança é comum. Qualquer alteração no percurso da criação de um sistema pode acarretar um aumento significativo de prazos, riscos e custos.   </p>

<p>A prototipagem vem ganhando aceitação nas comunidades de engenharia de software, sendo reconhecida como um modelo viável aplicado a construção de sistemas. A utilização de protótipos mostra rapidamente a compreensão e a utilização de um sistema pois ajuda, os clientes e os responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento do projeto, a testar e melhorar o sistema antes do seu término. Na engenharia de requisitos, a protipagem é empregada na geração de protótipos de interface, baseada em cenários. O desenvolvedor cria um protótipo para realizar alguma tarefa do sistema. O usuário vê a materialização do entendimento do desenvolvedor referente àquele cenário, e, uma vez que o protótipo deve ser constantemente refinado, o usuário pode solicitar as mudanças nos requisitos mais rapidamente. Um ponto positivo é que há uma maior compreensão do sistema e das tarefas de desenvolvimento, levantamento e validação de requisitos de forma contínua, reduzindo ambigüidades, inconsistência e divergências. </p>

<p>Estudos apontam que a utilização de protótipos reduz, em até 40%, os esforços dos desenvolvedores. A prototipagem vem sendo usada com sucesso, permitindo que, desde muito cedo, haja uma percepção dos requisitos do sistema, além da simplificação na concepção e no projeto de sistemas. </p>

<p>Um protótipo pode ser considerado uma implementação concreta, embora parcial, de um programa. Os protótipos podem ser criados para explorar múltiplas questões durante o desenvolvimento do software.  Por exemplo, um protótipo de uma interface gráfica tem como principal função captar as necessidades efetivas e concretas do usuário.  </p>

<p>Há diversas opções para fazer protótipos de sistemas de software. As técnicas variam conforme os custos e o esforço investido para a realização do protótipo e também pela fidelidade e generalidade dos resultados. Abaixo estão as técnicas de prototipagem mais usuais: </p>

<p>Storyboard Protótipo em papel Mágico de Oz Máquina de Cenários Prototipagem rápida Prototipagem evolutiva </p>

<p>Iremos nos concentrar apenas na Prototipagem evolutiva, que é o foco do nosso artigo: </p>

<p>Prototipagem Evolutiva: o principal ponto aqui é adquirir funcionalidade para demonstrar uma parte do sistema ao utilizador final, de modo que algum feedback seja conseguido do lado do cliente.  A medida que o sistema vai sendo desenvolvido, diversas funcionalidades são adicionadas ao protótipo e traduzidas numa eficiente implementação. No final, o sistema vai estar pronto no seu todo. </p>

<p>RacionalizaçãoNotamos que uma grande parte dos projetos abordam o mesmo tipo de empresa. São inúmeros os projetos de clínicas e hospitais, frente de loja, escritórios de advocacia, cada um com suas especificidades. Apesar dessas especificidades, existem muitas atividades em comum. Apenas como exemplo, todos precisam de um módulo de gerenciamento de usuários e permissões, todos tem um cadastro de clientes ou pacientes, os softwares médicos necessitam obrigatoriamente de uma agenda de marcação de consultas, os jurídicos necessitam de uma agenda de audiências, todos os de frente de loja necessitam de um sistema de contas a pagar e receber, estoque e etc... </p>

<p>Em outras palavras os alunos passam a maior parte do tempo fazendo a mesma coisa, uns com mais qualidade outros com menos. E a falta de qualidade em apenas um desses módulo é condição determinante para a não implantação desse projeto nas empresas parceiras. </p>

<p>Com o desenvolvimento de uma arquitetua reutilizável e livre, os alunos passariam a “adaptar” os sistemas às necessidades de cada empresa e a criar módulos para atender as especificidades de cada uma. Os módulos mais comuns já seriam amplamente testados e necessitariam de pouco ou nenhuma modificação. Os módulos novos seriam desenvolvidos obedecendo todas as atividades do processo de software e a produção de todos os artefatos necessários a produção de software de qualidade. Cada módulo novo poderia ser adaptado às necessidades de outras empresas por outros alunos e assim por diante. Nosso projeto pretende construir uma arquitetura de software reutilizável, além dos módulos de gerenciamento de usuários e permissões, que poderão ser utilizados em futuros TCCs.  </p>

<p>Trabalhos FuturosVamos projetar um cenário futuro. Um Escritório de Advocacia foi parceiro no desenvolvimento de um sistema de controle de processos e clientes, os alunos que desenvolveram o sistema não tem mais interesse em dar continuidade ao sistema pois estão atualmente envolvidos em outros projetos ou atividades. Esse escritório sentiu a necessidade de ajustes no sistema e de um novo módulo que faça a comunicação com o sistema da Justiça para atualizar o andamento dos processos. Esse ajuste e o novo módulo podem vir a ser um novo projeto de TCC desenvolvido por outros alunos.  Esse projeto pode ser adaptado a outras empresas parceiras (que já fazem uso do sistema de controle de processos) e assim, paulatinamente, iremos criando mercado para nossos alunos e egressos. </p>

<p>Por que mais um CMS?Por que esse CMS seria desenvolvido em português do Brasil, com toda a documentação feita em nosso idioma. Dessa forma, a curva de aprendizagem para o desenvolvimento de módulos e utilização do sistema é menos acentuada. Um dos problemas que percebemos durante as orientações nos TCC´s é que muitos alunos não dominam o idioma inglês, e portanto ficam impossibilitados de utilizar um sistema Gerenciador de Conteúdo, e adaptá-los às suas necessidades.  É desejável que nossos alunos procurem dominar a língua inglesa (que é o idioma mais utilizado no desenvolvimento de sistemas), contudo, não podemos condicionar o desenvolvimento de sistemas com a fluência no idioma, dessa forma, o projeto Guarda-Chuva pode ajudar muito os iniciantes. </p>

<p>Guarda-ChuvaO nome guarda-chuva foi dado pelo Prof. Osmar Junior durante as reuniões sobre a criação do projeto. Pretendíamos criar uma arquitetura que daria abrigo a outros projetos, e o nome Guarda-Chuva refletiu bem nossa idéia inicial. </p>

 title : The iatb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Current versionThe current version is beta2.4. http://iatb.googlecode.com/files/iatb_beta2.4.zip </p>

<p>What means IATB ?IATB means I Am The Boss. This is a tool for managers of geographically dispersed teams (less than 50 members). </p>

<p>What is IATB ?It is implemented using a simple LAMP configuration. It mainly consist in an activity tracking solution which allow a hierarchical consolidation of the reports. </p>

<p>Where does it come fromIt comes from my own experience as a manager of a team of system architects (20+) distributed over 4 countries and 7 locations (within a big international telco company). I did not found any tool matching with my expectations thus I decided to code it myself. It is not perfect, it is not very smart nor well coded but is working quite well. </p>

<p>Current statusThe first version is available for download: http://iatb.googlecode.com/files/iatb_beta2.4.zip </p>

<p>This is not solid rock but can be installed by an experienced LAMP developer. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll find on the Wiki: </p>

<p>A draft installation guide A draft user guide A very early draft of a developer guide </p>

<p>Please also read the frequently asked questions section. </p>

<p>You may also ask some questions to iatb.development@gmail.com </p>

<p>Planned evolutionsTechnical evolutionThe current implementation of IATB is based upon a hand-made and very simple framework. My intend is to have it deployed and used in beta mode on as much sites as possible and to collect as much feedback as I can in order: </p>

<p>build a developer network around the product that could help for its implementation refine the functional scope of the product and build a long term evolution roadmap set the basis of a more solid implementation </p>

<p>Indeed I think that the next version of IATB (planned for end of H1-2009) will benefit from a significant refactoring probably based on CodeIgniter (http://codeigniter.com/) open source development framework. </p>

<p>Functional evolutionAs said above, the functional scope of IATB is not closed yet. I count on &quot;real-life&quot; users to help me to improve the design of the solution and define a roadmap for usefull features. My assumption is that IATB will support, in a later release, a plug-in model which could allow various software modules to be added (expense tracking, holiday management, etc.).</p>

 title : The modicpquery Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is mod_icpquery?Apache&#39;s mod_rewrite provides ways to map values to attributes using the directive RewriteMap. RewriteMap can use flat mappings files, hashed mapping files, internal functions and external rewriting programs. One not well known feature of mod_rewrite is to extend this functionality with internal functions, defined in a separate Apache module. This allows to do complex and time consuming mappings, since the mapping request does not have to be passed through a single communication pipe, as in the case of an external rewrite program. </p>

<p>Internet Cache Protocolmod_icpquery is a package which can be used to find objects on caching servers by sending out a UDP query. This query conforms to RFC2186 also known as ICP and can be handled by various caching servers such as Squid. A cache server handling ICP should reply to an ICP-query with an ICP-response indicating if it holds the desired object in its cache or not. mod_icpquery is able to send UDP datagrams to a list of unicast and/or multicast IP-addresses. </p>

<p>Getting startedIntroduction and motivation for creating mod_icquery. Installation: How to build and install mod_icquery. Examples: Example setups for a typical usage of mod_icpquery. ConfigurationDirectives: The reference manual for mod_icpquery. MultipleInstantiation: In case you need the functionality for mod_icpquery more than once. Internals: For experts, knowing how to write Apache modules, which want to write their own mapping functionality, in order to extend mod_rewrite. Enjoy, Jacob Rief</p>

<p>Features include...Proven portability. Written in pure Perl. No compiler needed. Well documented API and a clean, class-based design. Doesn&#39;t depend on any &#39;extra&#39; modules.  If you have perl 5.10, you&#39;re set. International support; Unicode filenames are properly handled even on Win32. Support for many major extensions to the base protocol including the Fast (Peers) Extension and Mainline DHT. Getting Started...Getting a full client up and running with Net::BitTorrent is easy. Simply... Pick an installation method: CPAN shell: cpan Net::BitTorrent PPM shell: ppm install Net::BitTorrent (Note: I suggest using ActiveState&#39;s beta repositories.) Manually (from a Subversion checkout or extracted .tar.gz): perl ./Build.PL &amp;&amp; ./Build &amp;&amp; ./Build test &amp;&amp; ./Build install Type &quot;perldoc Net::BitTorrent&quot; at the command line for documentation and a very simple working client. </p>

<p>For more complete sample clients, see client.pl and web-gui.pl; these two files are also bundled with the Net::BitTorrent distribution but are not installed. For more geeky stuff, see my other repository here on GoogleCode... There, you&#39;ll find (among other things) perl4mIRC.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a wrapper library around the Mollom API. The library is written in C#, and uses the excellent XmlRpc library created by Charles Cook. </p>

<p>At the moment this is just a library wrapper around the API, abstracting the XmlRpc calls away. The objects returned by the library are serializable, so they can be stored in the ViewState or the Session objects. This is necessary to facilitate the Mollom session management, which is almost completely abstracted away.  </p>

<p>GettingThe latest version is NMollom 1.0.2.0, which targets Mollom/1.0. </p>

<p>You can download nmollom as a binary package: nmollom-1.0.2.0.zip. This includes the nmollom dll and the xmlrpc dll. </p>

<p>Alternatively, get the source from the svn repository and build it yourself. </p>

<p>ExamplesSee the MollomTestSite in the svn repository for an example on how to use the library.  You&#39;ll need to rename/copy example-web.config in the site&#39;s root, and fill in your own keys there to try it out. The site assumes that the keys used are in &quot;development mode&quot; at mollom (see their documentation on more info on &quot;development mode&quot;). </p>

<p>You can apply for a set of public-private keys at the Mollom site. </p>

<p>VersioningThe major and minor version of the NMollom assembly will always reflect the version of the Mollom API it is targeting. So version 1.0.2.0 targets Mollom/1.0.</p>

 summary : <p>ObremSDKcirca April 2007 by Neil C. Obremski </p>

<p>Welcome. </p>

<p>Someday I&#39;ll write something meaningful here, but until then just go play with my source. </p>

<p>C# .NET ConventionsTired of DLL and Assembly hell?  Try static linking instead with ObremSDK classes: a daily dose of code gems will keep your application healthy and fit.  Copy individual obrem-.cs files into your project tree or share the ObremSDK sub-folder of your choice using the svn:externals property in your project&#39;s Subversion repository. </p>

<p>Functionality isolated using classes not namespaces. Class source files prefixed with &quot;obrem-&quot;. Class names are preceded by &quot;Obrem&quot;. Classes of the same name between different versions (dotnet vs dotnet20 do the same thing; this goes for their members as well. Most .NET functions are static. The .NET version-specific folders are used only when the implementation of a class must differ between .NET versions.  An application must never include both of these, otherwise name conflicts will occur. The NET_20 macro will be checked for compiling .NET 2.0-optimized code in the general &quot;dotnet&quot; folder. Experimental functions and classes are suffixed with an underscore, i.e. SomeNewFoo. ASP.NET 2.0 RecommendationsAdd obremsdk/dotnet/ and obremsdk/dotnet20/ as svn:externals in your App_Code directory.</p>
 title : The panelswitcher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Not everyone loves the default placement of the panels in Gnome, and I’m one of them.</p>

<p>The Panel Switcher makes it possible to save and import panel layout settings. For each configuration it is possible to store a screenshot. Hopefully this will encourage users to experiment with different panel layouts, and share their layouts with others. The Panel switcher is shipped with some layout configurations. If you would like to contribute, please send me your layout and I will add it to the official release.</p>

<p>Panel switcher is implemented in Python, PyGTK and the Python bindings for GConf.</p>

 title : The w2wiki Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The iPhone&#39;s notes functionality leaves a little to be desired. I tried using a variety of wikis for keeping notes so that I could have access from both desktop and phone. While they&#39;re all very capable and fancy, they&#39;re all a bit &quot;fat&quot; with JavaScript and other knick-knacks, which drive up the time between click and ready-to-edit. I wanted something I could pull up on my iPhone with a minimum of latency. </p>

<p>I also wanted: </p>

<p>Plain text file storage (no databases) Markdown syntax Wiki-like linking Search Ability to embed images ...all without compromising speed too much. And of course, it has to look halfway decent on the iPhone. </p>

 summary : <p>The Blog King is a big bundle of Wordpress Plugins. It consist of Plugins written by me and 3rd Party Plugins. </p>

<p>Everytime you are using Wordpress to build up a blog or website you have the need for the same plugins. So i started to keep them in one place so i can easily update my old projects and quickly start new ones. </p>

<p>I used to host a couple of those Plugins and King Widgets on my blog (see links), but this is to hard for me to maintain.  </p>

<p>The plugins are constantly evolving, with every project, i use them in. There are still some Plugins in there, that might not work or are just experimental. With over 50 Plugins its not that easy to keep up with the development.  </p>

<p>You probably won´t need all anyway, so on the Wiki pages i´ll try to point you to the important/stable ones wich you can´t get anywhere else. </p>

<p>Since i don´t have the time to seperatly pack and link every one of my plugins, you need to have an SVN Client like TortoiseSVN (windows) to checkout or watch the changes in the code repository.</p>

 summary : <p>Minerva is an open source media blog that is built off the powerful CakePHP framework. It&#39;s goal is to be simple, yet flexible enough that it can accommodate a variety of needs for a blog or CMS. Therefore, it aims to be modular and scalable in design. </p>

<p>Due to the framework and practices behind this blog (or CMS), it is specifically designed to handle a site with 50 visitors or 50 million visitors and live in a variety of (LAMP) server environments. </p>

<p>Nov. 29th, 2008An official site is coming soon!  It will feature just the video and image portion of &quot;mult-media&quot; to give a demonstration and get something up before the year end. While a &quot;fully functionality&quot; (including audio) version existed in the past, the change in media player has delayed this in the &quot;newish&quot; version along with re-factoring code and making sure everything is solid. A theme system has been ironed out more or less (based on CakePHP&#39;s theme system) and Minerva Blog will push people toward using the BlueprintCSS framework (even though it&#39;s not required). All these decisions and revisions have led to the later launch date. Plus, hey, it&#39;s just one guy making this thing! (looking for volunteers soon)</p>

 title : The bigcache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewBigCache is a very simple cache API providing users with an infinite shared cache backed by Amazon S3. No servers required. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick code sample for how to use it. </p>

<p>// put an object into the cache
<br/>bigcache.put(&quot;somekey&quot;, myObject, 3600);</p>

<p>// Get an object from the cache
<br/>Object o = bigcache.get(&quot;somekey&quot;);News2008-11-14 Added asynchronous methods getAsync(key) and putAsync(key, object, expires) </p>

<p>BackgroundWhile testing out different caching scenarios, I got the idea of using S3 as a simple cache like memcached and decided to run some tests.  This is what typical test times look like running on an EC2 server (the memcached was running on a separate server) for retrieving 100 simple strings: </p>

<p>Memcached took: 219 S3 took: 2679 SDB took: 2302 ehcache memory took: 1 ehcache 95% disk took: 11 Memcached mod took: 219 S3 mod took: 2203 UPDATE: New AsyncMethods need to be added to this benchmark, big performance gains when using them.  </p>

<p>The last two mod tests retrieved 100 times, but only 10 different objects to see if S3 did any caching on recently retrieved items.  Running this repeatedly revealed very similar results time after time. I realize this isn&#39;t exactly the greatest benchmarking test, so no need to let me know otherwise. ;)  </p>

<p>So what can we gather from this: </p>

<p>In Memory is ultra fast (of course) From local disk is also extremely fast (although much slower than in memory, 10x) Memcached is amazingly fast too, especially considering it&#39;s over the network, apparently 2 ms per object (although much slower than in memory or local disk, 20x vs disk) S3 and SimpleDB were similar when retreiving directly by key/id, but both were much slower than any other solution at about 25ms per object, 10x vs memcached) So now you might say, &quot;well obviously memcached is the way to go for large scale caching&quot;, and I would have to agree fully. BUT what about the extra work required to run a pool of extra servers just for memcached? When you&#39;ve already got a ready to go infinite cache available in S3.  </p>

<p>Double Layer CacheNow you could just use S3 if you could live with the slowness, but the following scenario is an alternative that gives you the ultra fast memory/disk combo for your local cache and the slower S3 as the global shared cache. And usually your local disk is pretty much unused anyways so this makes good use of it.  It is like a chained cache consisting of in memory and disk caching (ehcache) with S3 as a secondary cache.  For example: </p>

<p>getObject(key){
<br/>   object = localCache.get(key);
<br/>   if(object != null) return object;
<br/>   object = s3cache.get(key);
<br/>   if(object != null) {
<br/>     localCache.put(key, object);
<br/>     return object;
<br/>   }
<br/>   object = getFromDatabase(key);
<br/>   if(object != null){
<br/>     localCache.put(key, object);
<br/>     s3Cache.put(key, object);
<br/>     return object;
<br/>   }
<br/>   return null;
<br/>}This scenario would fully support stateless/sessionless load balancing although if you had a ton of app servers and your data was pretty user specific (private), then local/disk cache might become useless unless you have sticky sessions enabled on your load balancer. It would really depend on your app.   </p>

 title : The cqxmlintf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A TCP socket-based service layer on ClearQuest that enables platform-independent clients to execute ClearQuest commands via XML. </p>

<p>OverviewThe ClearQuest XML Interface is a service layer on IBM&#39;s ClearQuest that allows platform-independent clients to send ClearQuest commands via XML. IBM&#39;s comparable solution required additional server hardware and installation of proprietary software on each client machine. Additionally, our implementation works better over the WAN, is scalable and utilizes a generic interface. </p>

<p>DetailsThe ClearQuest XML Interface (CQ/XML) is a service that waits for incoming TCP socket connections. Upon a successful connection, CQ/XML reads the XML coming through the socket. If the XML is not well-formatted, CQ/XML sends an XML-formatted error back to the sender. If the XML is well-formatted, CQ/XML logs-in to ClearQuest as the connecting user. The parsed commands are then executed within ClearQuest as that user. The result from each command is saved, reformatted as XML and sent back through the socket to the client before closing the socket. </p>

<p>JustificationThe use of CQ/XML as a &quot;ClearQuest layer&quot; instead of a &quot;database layer&quot; gives us several advantages over the direct database access that some of our customers have asked for. For one, ClearQuest business rules are still enforced. Secondly, we can enforce ClearQuest logins and passwords. Most importantly, ClearQuest history is maintained without compromising the integrity of the database. </p>

<p>ResultsCQ/XML has been extremely stable, with no application-level failures encountered through seven months of testing and fifteen months of production deployment. It scales extremely well. Under Sun Grid Engine tests, CQ/XML was still handling requests with over 350 near-simultaneous connections. Our user community has created several amazing extensions to ClearQuest, including completely new web interfaces, GUI-enabled version control system integrations, RSS feeds, plus more. Time permitting, we&#39;d love to clean them up and post them out here as well.</p>

If you only want to present an amount of information which changes infrequently it is recommend to use a basically static way to create your homepage. In this case your website does not need to have lots of dynamic features and it is less necessary to have a modifiable structure. To build such a homepage there are lots of developement tools at the market. </p>

<p>But if you wish to start a more flexible and dynamic homepage project this possibilities are not applicable. To instantiate such a project you need certain programming techniques rarely handled by people which just want to set up a homepage project. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a flexible structure of a homepage. The customer should be able to assemble the homepage of his desire from a pool of software parts.

 title : The induslearningframework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Indus Learning Framework(ILF)The indus learning framework is a suite of machine learning algorithms that learn from  datasets using sufficient statistics.  This framework is particularly useful in the following scenarios: </p>

<p> When the data set is huge and the it cannot be fit into memory (e.g arff file is huge and weka runs out of memory) </p>

<p> When access to underlying data instances is not available (due to considerations such as security or cost) but the datasources provides some statistics (like count queries) The current implementation of the framework provides Naive Bayes and Decison Trees. The framework has been written so that it can be extended to include more classifiers that are amenable to the sufficient statistics approach. </p>

<p>Refer the user&#39;s guide wiki for how to run the various classifiers in the framework. Besides being run from command line the ILF allows provides API which can be used to integrated into a target application. </p>

<p>      Extension With Indus Integration FrameworkThe system can use a data integration system to be able to learn from multiple disparate data sources. The current implementation has been extended to use  Indus Integration Framework.  User&#39;s are referred to the code and an example included in the source tree induse_extension_src </p>

 summary : <p>IneoArticle Management component for Invision Power Board.We&#39;ve added all of the code we have backed up for Ineo, going back to version 1.0.2. This includes the 1.x branch and the new ( unreleased ) version 2.x trunk that we were working on during the last few months of activity at Veriea.com. If you&#39;re interested in Ineo as an article manager and want to contribute, have a play around with the code and submit some patches. </p>

<p>We&#39;re also looking for a couple of IPS community members to help manage the project, if you&#39;re interested - drop us a line in the Google Group ( ineo-development@googlegroups.com ).  </p>

 summary : <p>iScore will comprise two applications. First, a web application for creating and managing baseball team rosters, game schedules, and player information and statistics. Second, an iPhone application to score live baseball games, the data from which will be transmitted back to the web application, updating the statistics in real-time (assuming a data connection is available).</p>
 title : The ivef-sdk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Goal  </p>

<p>Why was the IVEF SDK created
<br/>The purpose of the project is to provide potential users of the IVEF format with software tools to facilitate rapid development of software that interprets IVEF data.</p>

<p>IVEF stands for &quot;Inter VTS Exchange Format&quot;. This is an ongoing standardization effort for the exchange of information between VTS centres. This information consists of real-time tracking positions, static vessel information and voyage related information. The final version of the standard is likely to incorporate hydrological and meteological data as well as e.g. chart updates.</p>
 title : The jatran Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A source to source transformer from Java to Scala, jatran takes an ANTLR Java 1.5 AST and produce reasonably formatted code from it, for another language. </p>

<p>The current drop includes implementations for Scala, as well as Actionscript 2 &amp; 3  </p>

<p>Typically, the AST node that you pass would be the root of a tree - the ROOT_ID node that represents a Java compilation unit.  </p>

<p>The Project is based on Andy Tripp&#39;s Java Emitter</p>

 title : The jgoogleanalytics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionJGoogleAnalytics is a lightweight, unobtrusive Java utility for tracking usage information on Java applications through Google analytics. It can be used for gathering usage statistics on utilities, plugins(Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans etc.), client-side, server-side, middleware, desktop or any Java based applications. Hence, allowing us to perform usage &amp; trend analysis on the application of interest. </p>

<p>UsageIf you have a registered Google analytics account, you can write a code snippet like below to capture the usage data. FocusPoint is a logical point of focus in the application. It can be events like application/module load, user actions, error events etc. </p>

<p>  //Google analytics tracking code for Library Finder
<br/>  JGoogleAnalyticsTracker tracker = new JGoogleAnalyticsTracker(&quot;Library Finder&quot;,&quot;1.3.2&quot;,&quot;UA-2184000-1&quot;);</p>

<p>  FocusPoint focusPoint = new FocusPoint(&quot;PluginLoad&quot;);</p>

<p>  tracker.trackAsynchronously(focusPoint);Proof Of ConceptFor the proof of concept, I have used this tool in Library Finder-IntelliJ plugin. I was tracking events like plugin load, user actions like Find Library action, Configuration changes action etc. I could see the usage statistics when I login to the google analytics account. If you want to know more, please read this posting. </p>

<p>CaveatGoogle analytics does not update their reports in real time because of their high volume of subscribers. It usually gets updated every 24 hrs. If you are really curious to know if the tracking went fine, you can attach a LoggingAdapter to JGoogleAnalyticsTracker and see if you are seeing the success message. JGoogleAnalytics would gracefully ignore errors and not collect statistics for the application running offline (without network connectivity)</p>

 title : The jordens-jdbcspy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JDBCSpy </p>

<p>ObjectiveJDBCSpy aims to provide a lightweight means to obtain statistics at the JDBC driver level. </p>

<p>StatusIt currently provides minimal statistics around JDBC Statements and PreparedStatements but functionality is expected to improve over time. </p>

<p>JDBCSpy has been tested using PostgreSQL and hsqldb but should more or less work with any configurable JDBC data source. </p>

<p>The code is a work in progress (and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future). It&#39;s an interesting little side project that has actually shown some utility in a couple of situations.  </p>

<p>DependenciesThere are no run-time dependencies.  JDBCSpy (jdbcspy-core) has test-time dependencies on TestNG and hsqldb. </p>

<p>See the installation instructions for information on getting started. </p>

<p>Future PlansSupport for more Statement/PreparedStatement methods (currently only tracks executeQuery()) Provide a nice UI for statistics visualization (Currently in development) Recent Commits03/14/08Significant refactors around the viewing components (there have been a few commits over the last few month that haven&#39;t been accurately recorded on the project page). </p>

<p>What: </p>

<p>Introduced a common interface between GUI panels and the QueryStatistics they&#39;re displaying. Replaying a session from a JDBCSpy logfile should now work a little better. </p>

<p>01/03/08The result of some work performed during my pre-Christmas hack day. </p>

<p>What: </p>

<p>Updated to Surefire 2.4 and TestNG 5.7 </p>

<p>Two new JDBCSpyMBean interface methods: mark() and getSQLExecutionTime(). mark() allows you to explicitly have a message logged getSQLExecutionTime() provides the number of milliseconds spent executing SQL since the last reset. Introduced new module: jdbcspy-testutil JDBCSpyListener provides framework hooks to track SQL execution during TestNG test cases.   Provided an example callback implementation that generates an HTML report with test statistics. Updated UI panel to provide a mechanism to explicitly connect to a JDBCSpyMBean (host/port). mplemented a table panel that will display statistics about recently executed SQL. HACK QueriesPerSecondPanel now supports basic replay from a log file. 11/30/07Quick implementation of a properties object.  The properties object should (fairly) generically handle JDBCSpy properties that have either been specified as System properties or as members of a &#39;jdbcspy.properties&#39; file. </p>

<p>See modules/jdbcspy-core/examples for jdbcspy.properties examples </p>

<p>What: </p>

<p>Added support for reading properties from a jdbcspy.properties file on the classpath Changed JDBCSpyDriver.class to JDBCSpyDriver.wrappedDriver </p>

<p>11/12/07Implemented automatic resets and file-based logging. </p>

<p>What: </p>

<p>Initial support for enabling / disabling statistics gathering. JDBCSpy can now optionally write queries to a file. New JDBCSpyDriver.logFile connection url parameter QueriesPerSecondPanel now periodically clears itself.</p>

 title : The kairos Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kairos is a Pixlib extension that mainly rework on the transitions package to offer a new way to handle animations in your projects. </p>

<p>The main idea behind that project is that when we build animations in our games, sites, or applications, the speed of animations may changes according to the browser and/or the computer performances. Why not having a framerate-independant animation system ? Where tweens, movieclips and games routines always run at the same speed, even if framerate is different than the compiled one. </p>

<p>To realize that, all animated objects use a time bias in their algorithm. Basically, at each frame, objects compute animations according to the last frame duration. In that way, animations are not define in terms of unit/frames as we used to do, but as unit/seconds. </p>

<p>Please look at the wiki to a detailled description of Kairos mechanism and components.</p>

<p>Besides the appealing competitive aspects of the game, the community behind Hattrick is thriving. People from all over the world convene in the internal forum to discuss pretty much anything, whether related to the game or not. This community aspect drives some people to create websites with statistics about the game, and back in 2003, Maptrick was one such website. Originally envisioned as a &quot;graphical overview of where Hattrick players live in the world&quot;, it developed into something else. Over time, it evolved the following features: </p>

<p>- a historic overview of where ownerless teams existed in the league structure, and how the perceived problem of decreased competitivity increased over time - tracking of league growth and shrinkage over time - tracking of training type preference over time - Support for &quot;flag chasing&quot; (a form of meta-gaming where players arrange friendly matches with teams from countries that their team has never visited before) - the &quot;Hall of Cool&quot;, showing which teams have the &quot;coolest&quot; flags&quot; - a &quot;friendly suggester&quot; that makes it easier to find teams that will give you a flag </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Maptrick was forced to move from the server that it was hosted on, before it could be moved to the servers of fellow statistics service, Alltid. The cause was simple: Maptrick was created as a hobby project, and contains lots of sub-par code and queries, and lacks good documentation, which both precipitated its ejection from the (shared) server and made it harder to port to the (already strained) Alltid servers. </p>

<p>Now that Maptrick is in limbo between the original server and Alltid, and no end is in sight because of time restraints on the part of the developers, a possible solution presented itself: open the source to the public, so that people who do have time may make the code suitable for a production server, and maybe even add a feature or two. </p>

<p>If you think you can help, and you want write access to the repository, send an e-mail to CHPP-ste1n (laszlo.vandenhoek@gmail.com). Depending on public interest, I will add documentation that may ease development. </p>

<p>Documentation is mostly lacking, but for now you can start at [Architecture]. Further documentation will be provided as soon as someone asks for it.</p>

 title : The openepi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Openepi is a JavaScript and HTML framework for statistical calculators.  It has more than 20 modules providing epidemiologic statistics for clinical and public health use with summary data.  Because Openepi consists entirely of client-side code, it can be downloaded and run from disk or run from the website.  The current version stores data in Windows by using an .HTA wrapper, but future plans call for enhanced data storage, and more statistics. </p>

<p>OpenEpi? provides statistics for counts and measurements in descriptive and analytic studies, stratified analysis with exact confidence limits, matched pair and person-time analysis, sample size and power calculations, random numbers, sensitivity, specificity and other evaluation statistics, R x C tables, chi-square for dose-response, and links to other useful sites. </p>

<p>OpenEpi? is free and open source software for epidemiologic statistics. It can be run from a web server or downloaded and run without a web connection. A server is not required. The programs are written in JavaScript? and HTML, and should be compatible with recent Linux, Mac, and PC browsers, regardless of operating system. A new tabbed interface avoids popup windows except for help files. </p>

<p>Test results are provided for each module so that you can judge reliability, although it is always a good idea to check important results with software from more than one source. Links to hundreds of Internet calculators are provided. </p>

<p>The programs have an open source license and can be downloaded, distributed, or translated. Some of the components from other sources have licensing statements in the source code files. Licenses referred to are available in full text at OpenSource?.org/licenses. OpenEpi? development was supported in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Emory University, Rollins School of Public Health. </p>

<p>A toolkit for creating new modules and for translation is included. Please let us know if you would like to collaborate in this way. Suggestions, comments, and expressions of interest in contributing to this effort should be sent by email to: andy.dean@gmail.com, cdckms@sph.emory.edu, and msoe@sph.emory.edu</p>

<p>However visual comparison to actual distribution data may also yield interesting insights not possible with testing various hypothesis, since a hypothesis test is but one facet of a feature of a distribution versus actual data. </p>

<p>This package attempts to make it easier to use visual inspection for comparison. In no way will visual comparison be sufficient for data analysis, but it is an important part. </p>

<p>The rdisplot package provides methods to plot quantiles and densities of experimental data versus theoretical values (qq plots with enhancements). </p>

<p>This package is in alpha stage, and under active development.</p>

 title : The reflecxx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Reflecxx is a simple tool for generating type information for C/C++ code.  It works by translating debugging information in object files into C data structures that can be linked into your program.  Type information is only generated when it is referenced in your source code, so extraneous data will not be included.  For example, if you wanted to convert an enumerated value to a string, you would declare the type and an external reference to the type information to be generated: </p>

<p>  enum hw_enum_t { HELLO_WORLD };
<br/>  extern struct reflecxx_full_type hw_enum_t_type_info;Then, to convert the value, you would use the reflecxx_enum_by_value() function: </p>

<p>  printf(&#39;%s\n&#39;, reflecxx_enum_by_value(&amp;hw_enum_t_type_info, HELLO_WORLD)-&gt;
<br/>	   ree_name);To generate the type information, first, you would compile the file and then run reflecxx-gen: </p>

<p>  $ gcc hw.c -c -o hw.o
<br/>  $ reflecxx-gen hw.o &gt; hw-type-info.c
<br/>  $ gcc hw-type-info.c hw.o -o hw
<br/>  $ ./hw

<p>Программа SqLim предназначена для системных администраторов небольших организаций, имеющих задачу контроля использования ресурсов Интернет сотрудниками организации и учета потребляемого интернет-трафика. Программа собирает статистику об интернет активности пользователей из логов прокси-сервера Squid. </p>

<p>Пользователи имеют возможность просмотра собственной статистики за выбранный интервал времени через web-интерфейс. При использовании basic-авторизации у пользователя имеется возможность менять свой пароль для squid через web-интерфейс. </p>

<p>Администратор SqLim может просматривать общую статистику и подробную статистику по каждому пользователю, вводить ограничения на размер месячного трафика пользователя, при использовании basic-авторизации управлять списком пользователей через web-интерфейс. </p>

<p>Настройки программы позволяют: </p>

<p>использовать два вида авторизации пользователей: basic и ntlm. хранить информацию о доступе в интернет за произвольный период времени задавать опциональный список сайтов, для которых траффик суммируется не по полному имени домена, а по домену заданного (обычно второго) уровня, т.е. i36.odnoklassniki.ru, i51.odnoklassniki.ru не показываются отдельными строчками, а выводиться их сумма как odnoklassniki.ru иметь список пользователей, обладающих правами администратора, но без возможности изменять лимиты трафика других пользователей, их отображаемые имена, создавать/удалять пользователей и менять их пароли при basic-аторизации. отображать величину трафика в байтах либо мегабайтах </p>

<p>Модули программы написаны на Perl и sh, поэтому теоретически программу можно заставить запускаться на любой платформе, где имеются perl, apache, squid, mysql и возможность запуска скриптов по расписанию. Практически тестировалось на CentOS Linux. </p>

<p>Загрузить программу можно со страницы загрузки. История версий программы доступна здесь. Имеется краткая документация по установке, настройке и использованию. Замечания и предложения по улучшению программы просим направлять сюда. </p>

<p>The general usage flow is to tally a whole bunch of results in the Statistics::Contingency object, then query that object to obtain the measures you are interested in.  When all results have been collected, you can get a report on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and so on, with both macro-averaging and micro-averaging over categories.</p>

<p>These critical values are needed to perform statistical tests, like the u test, the t test, the F test and the chi-squared test, and to calculate confidence intervals. </p>

<p>This is a direct port of the Perl module Statistics::Distributions. </p>

 summary : <p>PurposeThis project aims to develop a flexible training log application for desktop use.  It is  written in C++ with Qt4 libraries, supporting cross platform usage. </p>

<p>DetailsThe target audience includes runners of all ability levels, and especially those who enjoy varied activity.  This program provides a means to track many different types of activities (great for those unfortunate periods of injury), yet maintains a loose focus on running.  A jogger, new marathoner, or elite miler should all feel comfortable entering data, for the fields correspond to relevant aspects of daily training. </p>

<p>The current version supports a number of basic attributes when describing an activity, including: </p>

<p>Date Time Location Route Duration Distance Effort Splits, and  Notes While some of these attributes are more suitable for distance oriented activities, this logging application currently categorizes entries into the following: </p>

<p>Run Workout Race Bike Cycle Walk Rest Swim Lift Core, and  Other Once the data is entered, it is stored in a flexible and open database.  By querying this database, the application is able to allow for easy browsing.  Furthermore, by employing an enterprise-level database system, this program can powerfully manipulate the result set.  This allows the user to filter all logged activities by every attribute or keyword.   </p>

<p>In addition to this filtering mechanism, the application provides a powerful plotting tool.  By default, distance vs. time is plotted for the arbitrary selected set, however an extensive plotting library exists.  One can imagine plotting duration or effort vs. time, distance vs. effort, or even duration vs distance vs effort. </p>

<p>Integration with an online street map/desktop globe is also provided.  This allows a user to accurately calculate a recent run.  It is planned that future versions will allow users to save and load custom routes.  Such a feature would simplify data entry, and perhaps give greater meaning to the splits of common runs. </p>

<p>Technical features Developed with Qt4.4 and gcc C++  XML configuration file  SQLite local database  MySQL remote database  database format well-defined and open to 3rd party interaction  therefore, multiple conceivable user interfaces (CLI, QT, GTK)  also, web publishing with a LAMP stack Future goals integration into modern, existing technologies, including Facebook  generalization of design to minimize running focus  generalization of code to allow for greater database support  define a split descriptor language for machine parsing</p>
 summary : <p>Tremulous Clientside Statistics, or TremCS for short, is a statistics script that was written in Python originally to generate useful stats for Tremulous but has now evolved into an event based scripter for Tremulous gamers as well. </p>

<p>The current version can:  generate graphs of kills and deaths during a game.  generate graphs over a long period of time to see how you are improving...if at all.  create themable banners, avatars and even animated userbars!  create web pages.  output text stats. upload all of the above to a website via FTP or view it locally. </p>

<p>It has been designed to be multiplatform and works on Linux, Windows and MacOS (but has only been tested on Linux) This project is being prepared for release.</p>

 summary : <p>A collection of programs, tools, functions, scripts and source code snippets cohesively packaged to make the daily lives of those who work with the Teradata database easier in as many respects as possible. </p>

<p>This project currently contains the following items: </p>

<p>User Defined FunctionsORDERED_CONCAT() </p>

<p>Have you ever written a procedure or script that generates SQL, and wanted to generate an ordered list of columns?  Did you end up writing an ugly FOR loop in Teradata SPL? </p>

<p>The ORDERED_CONCAT aggregate function will combine input values with a delimiter ordered by a value you specify.  Try it out using a statement like this! </p>

<p> SELECT
<br/>   &#39;SELECT &#39; ||
<br/>   ORDERED_CONCAT(TRIM(ColumnName), &#39;, &#39;, ColumnID) ||

<br/> FROM
<br/>   DBC.Columns
<br/> GROUP BY
<br/>   DatabaseName
<br/> , TableName
<br/> ;SECONDS() </p>

<p>This set of functions will convert INTERVAL values into a total number of seconds.  Useful for downstream calculations on the difference of two TIMESTAMP values: </p>

<p> SELECT
<br/>   StartTime                                         (TITLE &#39;Start&#39;)

 title : The wivet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WIVET is a benchmarking project that aims to statistically analyze web link extractors. In general, web application vulnerability scanners fall into this category. These VAs, given a URL(s), try to extract as many input vectors as possibly they can to increase the coverage of the attack surface.  </p>

<p>WIVET provides a good sum of input vectors to any extractor and presents the results. In order an input extractor to run meaningfully, it has to provide some kind of session handling, which nearly all of the decent crawlers do. </p>

<p>As a side note, you don&#39;t have to (though encouraged) download and setup your own WIVET. (You can basically visit WGT Page). Just make sure you read usage page first! </p>

<p>WIVET v3 is released (Try the SVN for up-to-date teasers...)</p>

 summary : <p>Yeti WitchThis project adds several well known techniques for finding strings-that-almost-match-other-strings to the native Javascript String object, some of which are phonetic algorithms. </p>

<p>The supported list currently includes Soundex, Refined Soundex, Metaphone, Caverphone, Levenshtein distance, anagrams and Porter Stemming. All of these are primarily designed to work with the English language, although anagrams and Levenshtein are just string analysis so will work with anything. </p>

<p>The extensions are primarily designed to be executed under the Rhino scripting engine although porting them to different interpreters (to run in the browser or whatever) should be trivial. </p>

<p>TestsAfter checking out (or downloading) the code you should probably execute the unit tests. This will determine whether your system will run the code. </p>

<p> svn checkout http://yeti-witch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ yeti-witch-read-only
<br/> cd ./yeti-witch
<br/> java -jar js.jar test/run.jsTo run the tests without clocking the test times use the -noclock flag.  </p>

<p> java -jar js.jar test/run.js -noclockIf you want to use copy of Rhino in your classpath then remove the one distributed with Yeti. I&#39;ve tested it on Rhino1_7R2pre &amp; Rhino1_5, 1_6R7 running under OSX 1.4. </p>

<p>ExamplesThe anagram tool will compare two arguments and return a &#39;1&#39; if the strings are anagrams of one another, </p>

<p> // prints &#39;1&#39; - ie. is an anagram
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/anagram/is.js &#39;fawlty towers&#39; &#39;flowery twats&#39;You can print the Caverphone code of a given string, </p>

<p> // prints &#39;WK11111111&#39; 
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/caverphone/get_code.js &#39;witch&#39;The Levenshtein tool (AKA. edit distance) will return an integer representing the number of operations needed to transform a given string in to the second given string. </p>

<p> // prints &#39;1&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/levenshtein/distance.js &#39;beatls&#39; &#39;beatles&#39;Likewise, metaphone gives you the metaphone code for a given string. Providing a second argument will set the metaphone key length, which defaults to 4. </p>

<p> // prints &#39;LNTNLM&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/metaphone/get_code.js &#39;london olympia&#39; 6Porter&#39;s stemming algorithm will attempt to truncate spurious word endings in order to find word stems. </p>

<p> // these two words have the same stem, &#39;probabl&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/porter/stem.js &#39;probably&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/porter/stem.js &#39;probabilities&#39;There&#39;s also a utility to stem an input file of new-line-seperated words. </p>

<p> // prints a list of stemmed output 
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/porter/stem-file.js &quot;test/data/stemmer/input&quot;Both Soundex and Refined Soundex have utilities that (a), print the soundex code of a given string, </p>

<p> // prints, B342 and B10673
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex/get_code.js &#39;beatls&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex-refined/get_code.js &#39;beatls&#39;... and (b), a diff tool that, in Soundex&#39;s case return the number of characters that are the same in a two give soundex keys - and given the keys have a maximum length of 4 characters, 4 indicates an exact match while 0 a very inexact match, </p>

<p> // the soundex values differs slightly, so printed value is &#39;3&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex/difference.js &#39;threw&#39; &#39;through&#39;</p>

<p> // The soundex values differs entirely, so the printed value is &#39;0&#39;
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex/difference.js &#39;witch&#39; &#39;trumpet&#39;While in Refined Soundex&#39;s case the difference is expressed as a decimalised percentage of the difference between the two codes. </p>

<p> // prints 0.5, as their is a 50% difference in their Refined Soundex keys
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex-refined/difference.js &#39;buzz&#39; &#39;fuzz&#39; // as above but reduce the key comparison to &#39;3&#39;, which prints 0.25
<br/> java -jar js.jar examples/soundex-refined/difference.js &#39;buzz&#39; &#39;fuzz&#39; 3XML LookupGiven some of the operations are time intensive it may be quicker to generate a one-off lookup file containing a pre-defined list of words translated to their phonetic codes. So, for each word in a given file the xml lookup tool will produce an xml sequence containing the various Yeti-Witch algorithms, </p>

<p> java -jar js.jar examples/lookup/xml.js &#39;dictionary/names.girls&#39;Using one of the shipped dictionaries this will print something like this,  </p>

<br/> Anagrams and Levenshtein are excluded from this as they are both comparison operations that need a second (eg. user input) string. </p>

 title : The csharp-googlemaps Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims to provide better integration of Google Maps with .NET applications.  It provides a set of C# classes and functions for creating Google Maps.  This interface attempts to adhere to the Javascript API as much as possible. </p>

<p>The basic usage is to build your maps in C# and then translate them to javascript with one function call.  You can also create parts of the map and translate them into Javascript - such as a set of markers.  This might be useful if creating a web service as the backend for an interactive map. </p>

<p>The code includes the C# library and an example application.  The library comes with a basic web control for getting started quickly, but you do not have to use the library this way. </p>

<p>This library does not support everything that the Javascript API provides, but is rather a rough sketch of Google Maps. </p>

<p>Example 1: MarkersHere&#39;s a basic example.  Let&#39;s show the google maps representation of a `for&#39; loop. </p>

<p>C# </p>

<p>Map map = mapControl.map;</p>

<p>for(float i=30; i-100; j--) {
<br/>		Marker m = new Marker(new LatLng((float)i, (float)j));
<br/>		map.addOverlay(m);
<br/>	}
<br/>}</p>

<p>addJavascript(mapControl.GetJavascript()); </p>

<p>Example 2: Info WindowsThe same example, but with some information windows with tabs. </p>

<p>C# </p>

<p>Map map = mapControl.map;</p>

<p>for(float i=30; i-100; j--) {
<br/>		Marker m = new Marker(new LatLng((float)i, (float)j));
<br/>		m.addInfoWindowTab(new InfoWindowTab(&quot;Profile&quot;, &quot;My name is Peter.\n&quot; +
<br/>			&quot;I am 23 years old.&quot;));
<br/>		m.addInfoWindowTab(new InfoWindowTab(&quot;Location&quot;, &quot;I live in the United States.&quot;));
<br/>		map.addOverlay(m);

<p>　　设计本框架的目的主要有以下几方面：（1）、帮助刚进入语音开发领域的朋友迅速了解相关方面的知识。对此，本人有深刻的体会，刚接触时一点头绪也没有，幸得网上有不少热心的朋友及时的给了我许多帮助让我可以较快的完成自己的项目。所以我希望将这种精神延续下去，以使更多的朋友从中受益；（2）、为大家进行语音应用开发提供一套可用的基础性框架，使我们的程序员能够将主要的精力集中于业务逻辑的开发，而不再纠缠于底层板卡驱动之间的异同；（3）、屏蔽不同厂商、不同型号语音板卡之间的差异，让相同的业务逻辑代码可以在任何地方使用，从而使开发人员及软件厂商的开发成果得于积累；（4）、利于大型项目的团队协同开发，由于框架在设计之初便充分考虑了大型项目的协作特性，可以很好的适应当前大、中型项目中对于并发开发的要求。</p>

 title : The megarit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MEGARIT is a library to do efficient multiprecision integer arithmetic. The first implementation will be in C#.</p>

<p>The library offers operations and functions sufficient for a solid layer for mathematical applications or libraries which provide high-level functionality. It emphasizes on efficient internal implementations and will compare fine with the best libraries available.</p>

<p>The MEGARIT library provides three interfaces to the arithmetical kernel:</p>

<p>(1) C#-like style (operations).
<br/>(2) Java-like style (member functions).
<br/>(3) Assembler-like style (in-place operations).</p>

<p>The interfaces (1) and (2) are based on the concept of immutable integers, interface (3) is not.  Interface (3) provides mutable integers and thus will lower the memory management overhead in many applications. The freedom
<br/>to choose between mutable and immutable integers within the same framework will be appreciated by many developers. (Note that even the Java BigInteger library internally uses mutable integers though this feature is not exported!)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a compile time option will be provided to exclude the use of mutable integers from the library for those who want to assure that only immutable integers are used.</p>

 summary : <p>Several years ago, Erik Doernenburg created a type of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) software named Neo.  </p>

<p>From the original project: </p>

<p>The .NET Entity Objects Framework
<br/>Neo is a framework for .NET developers who want to write enterprise applications with an object-based domain model. It is well suited for domain-driven design and agile development. 
<br/>Neo includes tools that create an extensible object-based domain model as well as the database schema from a an abstract description of the model. At run-time, rich schema information is used to dynamically generate all SQL required for object persistence management. Being based on ADO.NET data sets, a Neo domain model is independent of the actual backing store and works equally well with databases and objects in an XML representation. 
<br/>The last official release was in June 2006. Since then, several users have continued to use and improve Neo. This project, dubbed Neo2, is our effort to consolidate, update, and extend this most excellent development tool. </p>

 summary : <p>MotivationThe introduction of the mobile phone has introduced modern society to widespread ubiquitous computing.  Yet the general overwhelming acceptance of mobile phones as a convenience and necessity is offset by a laundry list of prevalent inconveniences and annoyances. Not least of these problems with mobile phones is the amount of switching between ringtone volumes and types throughout the day.  Many people find it necessary to switch between high and low volume ringtones or between sound only, vibration only, and no ringtones multiple times every day.   This presents a few common problems for mobile phone users.  First, there is the annoyance of having to physically adjust the ringtone settings several times a day.   Then there is also a category of problems that summed up as inappropriate ringtones.  These generally arise from either forgetting to switch between different ringtone settings or not bothering to switch from one ringtone setting when it will be needed again shortly (e.g. during a ten minute break from class or work).  These inappropriate ringtones often cause one to miss a call when they have an opportunity to take it, or cause one to be disruptive when one is in a focused setting (e.g. at a business meeting or in class).   </p>

<p>ClaimAlthough many mobile phone designers have worked hard to make ringtone switching simple, but as of yet there is no widespread automated system for ringtone switching. There are a few methods of automating this system that are worthy of consideration.  Two systems that are common to ubiquitous computing would be time-based ringtone switching or location-based ringtone switching.  Both of these methods offer very practical ways of automating ringtone switching, but still require fairly regular input from the user and are prone to inappropriate ringtones as phone availability is not always clear cut in terms of a set of rules based on time and space.  We argue that to implement reliable ringtone switching, knowing where or when you are doing something isn’t as important as knowing what you are doing.   We hypothesize that the most appropriate ringtone is based on the level of physical activity one is involved in at the time of the call.  For example: if one is involved in a high level of activity (such as walking), then a loud ringtone is usually appropriate.  Inversely, if one is involved in a low level of activity (such as sitting), then a quiet ringtone (including vibration only and no ringtone) is appropriate.   If such a system can be implemented to within a certain level of accuracy, then we believe that with only basic calibration and some very infrequent adjustments, activity-based ringtone switching has real potential for being the basis of completely automated ringtone switching.  In other words, this very basic system will act as the initial proof-of-concepts for a product-level activity-based ringtone switching system. </p>

<p>Solution ApproachAlthough most mobile phone manufacturers do not include “activity level sensors” in their phones, the Apple iPhone offers a convenient platform for prototyping such a system.  The iPhone comes with an onboard accelerometer that can be used to measure changes in acceleration as well as general orientation of the phone.  In order to prove the concept of an activity-based ringtone switching application, we would like to start with an exploratory study based on a simple iPhone application that varies the volume of a noise based on perceived level of activity during simulated phone calls.  These simulated phone calls will occur on some provided time interval (either random or user defined) for testing and demonstration purposes.   We plan on creating a very simple application providing basic sound playback, user customizability for testing, and data retrieval for statistical analysis.  The purpose of this study will be to determine feasibility an activity-based ringtone switching system.  We will measure the feasibility of this system based on creating an application that simulates the accuracy of such a system and observation made on the effectiveness of these simulations.</p>

 title : The bourre Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bourre or Boo-Ray is a trick based card game originating in Louisiana.It is similar in play to Spades and Euchre.  Like many card games the rules vary from game to game.A typical Bourre game goes like this. </p>

<p>An ante is placed into the pot by all players.  The dealer deals 5 cards to each player. After dealing and before looking at his cards, the dealer is flips face up one of his cards to determine the trump suite that will be used by everyone during the game. At this point each of the players decide in a clockwise fashion starting just left of the dealer if they are in, out, or check. Once a single player is in, the check option is no longer available. Players that drop are out for the duration of this particular game which could be many hands. Players that remain in are allowed to draw new cards by discarding a like number. Due to the deck only having 52 cards, a game of 7 allows each player to  draw 2 and a game of 6 allows each player to  draw 3.  If there are 5 or fewer players, each player can draw up to 5 cards.  Once the draw is complete, the player to the left of the dealer starts the game by leading a card. The next player must play a card of the same suite if he has one, otherwise he can &quot;throw off&quot; another suit or &quot;trump&quot; the played suite. The highest card of the led suite wins the trick unless trump cards are played. If trump cards are played, the highest trump card would win the trick. Aces are the highest cards and 2&#39;s are the lowest.  Any player not winning a single trick must match the pot.  Any player winning three tricks wins the pot.  If one ore more players match the pot, the game continues even if someone gets 3 tricks since this money replaces the pot.   If no one gets 3 tricks to win the game, a round a ante&#39;s occurs and  another game is dealt by the person on the left of the dealer.  The deal rotates in a clockwise rotation.  The game ends when two players remain and one player gets 3 or 4 ticks and the other player gets 1 or 2 tricks.    </p>

<p>Remaining goals are as follows: </p>

<p>Complete the game engine and run simulations using various styles of play to determine winning statistics Log these statistics to a mysql database Build a user interface on top of the game and be able to play on an iphone and website.  If you are a UI specialist and are interested in contributing to this project, please let me know.   </p>

 title : The lumpsplit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The long-term management of metapopulations were performed through simulations for a case study based loosely upon herring to the west of the British Isles. These stocks are currently assessed and managed by management area, although there is evidence of much mixing between stocks (in terms of connectivity, migrations and exploitation). The simulations test the sustainability of fishing under two hypotheses corresponding to either discrete stocks which only mix on the feeding grounds, or where diffusion between stocks takes place, and where the assessment process assumes either discrete stocks or one metapopulation. The study showed that assessment based upon virtual population analysis could fail to detect overexploitation of stocks and to detect and distinguish between the effects of exploitation and regime shifts.</p>

 title : The newcp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I/O in applications has become the biggest bottleneck in desktops, scientific computing, large scale simulations etc. Improvement in CPU speeds has shown significant improvement as compared to improvement in disk and memory speeds. Multi-tasking in Operating Systems gives rise to multiple I/O streams. Unlike the shared resource, the CPU, multiple I/O  streams can actually degrade the performance of the disk. In this article, we present a simple case study where we look at multiple sequential I/O streams accessing the same disk and study the degradation in performance caused by this scenario. We further propose a simple solution to remedy this situation. Readers who study this article are more likely to realize how to improve the performance of simple applications running on their desktop. </p>

<p>We believe that any reader familiar with programming and using any Operating system such as Linux, AIX, Solaris etc can immediately grasp the underlying idea and benefit from it. </p>

<p>We based our project on the coreutils package. We modified the existing file &quot;copy.c&quot;, and added a header file, both of which can be found in the &quot;Source&quot; repository. </p>

<p>A full report of our project, explaining the idea, its implementation and the description and results of all the tests we ran, is available in the download section.</p>

<p>What is PackmolPackmol creates an initial point for molecular dynamics simulations by packing molecules in defined regions of space. The packing guarantees that short range repulsive interactions do not disrupt the simulations. </p>

<p>The great variety of types of spatial constraints that can be attributed to the molecules, or atoms within the molecules, makes it easy to create ordered systems, such as lamellar, spherical or tubular lipid layers. </p>

<p>The user must provide only the coordinates of one molecule of each type, the number of molecules of each type and the spatial constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. </p>

<p>The package is compatible with input files of PDB, TINKER, XYZ and MOLDY formats. </p>

 summary : <p>Projet CSR C++`Comment se compliquer la vie pour simplifier un projet.&#39; :) </p>

<p>Ce projet a pour but de reconstruire le projet CSR, option en 2e semestre de Licence 2 PCGI Option Informatique jusqu&#39;en 2007/2008. En dernière année avant une réforme fatale, nous fûmes la dernière promo à qui on a confié ce projet. </p>

<p>CSR?Conception de Systèmes Réactifs. Ce cursus avait comme objectif d&#39;apprendre les bases de la programmation orientée objets, des diagrammes UML, des algorithmes de recherche de chemin, de machines à états (automates, ou Finite State Machines)... tout ceci pour pouvoir entreprendre le projet CSR. </p>

<p>Ce projet regroupait donc tout ce que nous avions appris pour modéliser un comportement &quot;intelligent&quot; pour des entités simulées dans un environnement virtuel. </p>

<p>Ici, il s&#39;agissait de robots qui parcouraient et exploraient un labyrinthe plus ou moins complexe, à la recherche de clefs nécessaires pour ouvrir une Star-Gate, le but final. </p>

<p>La carte était parsemée de points de recharge qui pouvaient être piégés, et les robots perdaient de l&#39;énergie et se réchauffaient, et devaient donc coopérer pour atteindre le but. </p>

<p>Pourquoi reconstruire?Le projet d&#39;origine devait être programmé avec un langage appelé oRis, un langage développé par Fabrice Harrouet, et à la fois orienté objets et orienté agents. </p>

<p>ORis est un langage script et est conçu pour les simulations de mondes virtuels à base d&#39;entités autonomes, et est donc de très haut niveau et plus lent qu&#39;un programme compilé.  </p>

<p>De plus, le projet oRis a été délaissé, certaines fonctionnalités sont difficilement implémentées et et les binaires n&#39;étaient pas compatibles avec Windows, et pas toujours compatibles avec MacOS et Linux. </p>

<p>Nous avons donc décidé de refaire ce projet, pour produire un environnement/framework uniquement pour ce genre de simulation (cf §&quot;CSR?&quot;), avec un coeur compilé et rapide, et une implémentation par script dans un langage de niveau plus bas et plus généralisé.</p>

<p>0. Définir un espace 2D (E2D) sous forme d&#39;une grille de dimension 50 cases x 50 cases. </p>

<p>1. Simuler la marche aléatoire d&#39;un agent partant d&#39;un point quelconque de cette grille en se dirigeant vers l&#39;un des 8 voisins (laisser une trace de toutes les cases parcourues pour 1000 pas, par exemple, d&#39;itération. (note 1) </p>

<p>2. Disposer, aléatoirement sur E2D, 650 ressources de 3 types différents (notés r1, r2, r3) et équiprobables. (note 2) </p>

<p>3. Définir la fonction sensorielle &quot;capteur&quot; de cet agent qui renvoie le nombre de ressources de type rx (pour chaque x=1,2,3) présentes parmi les 8 voisines de la position où il se trouve. (note 3) </p>

<p>4. Procéder à une marche aléatoire de cet agent          et  tracer  les   3  courbes histogrammes des ressources rencontrées. (note 4) </p>

<p>5. Définir 3 comportements pour cet agent : </p>

<p>- marche aléatoire de l&#39;agent vers une case voisine de là où il se trouve (déjà vu précédemment). </p>

<p>- prise par l&#39;agent, là où il se trouve, d&#39;une ressource en proportion inverse à sa fréquence parmi les 8 voisins : prob = 0 si freq = 8, prob = 1 si freq = 0 (à condition que l&#39;agent n&#39;ait pas déjà pris quelque chose et que la ressource se trouve là). </p>

<p>- pose par l&#39;agent, là où il se trouve, d&#39;une ressource proportionnellement à sa fréquence parmi les 8 voisins : prob = 1 si freq = 8, prob = 0 si freq = 0 (à condition que l&#39;agent ait une ressource &quot;en main&quot; et que la place soit libre). (note 5) </p>

<p>6. A chaque temps de cycle un seul de ces 3 comportements est effectuable {wa = walk, tx = take(rx), px = put(rx)}. Produire graphiquement la marche aléatoire de l&#39;agent, la liste des comportements enchaînés lors de la marche de cet agent et la liste des types de ressources rencontrées lors de cette marche (sur une centaine de cycles environ). (note 6) </p>

<p>7. Définir suffisamment d&#39;agents (tous caractérisés par les 3 comportements décrits en (question 5)) et les lancer dans des marches à partir de positions initiales aléatoires dans l&#39;espace ETD rempli de ressources, de sorte à faire apparaître des tas de ressources du même type. (note 7) </p>

<p>8. Définir un champ d&#39;attraction linéaire dans E2D (par exemple de gauche à droite) dont les cases alentour de celle de l&#39;agent sont d&#39;autant plus attractives qu&#39;elles se rapprochent du bord droit de E2D. Le rôle de ce champ est de modifier la probabilité de se diriger vers 1 des 8 voisins d&#39;une case donnée (jusqu&#39;ici walk s&#39;effectuait vers 1 des 8 voisins tous équiprobables). (note 8) </p>

<p>9. Procéder à une marche aléatoire pour un agent dans ce nouvel E2D (sans ressource mais avec champ linéaire attractif droit) à partir d&#39;une case initiale quelconque mais fixée au départ. Réitérer de telles marches en partant de cette même case initiale. Laisser une trace de toutes les cases parcourues au terme de toutes ces marches (effectuer une ou deux dizaines de marches). (note 9) </p>

<p>10. Transformer ce champ (statique) en un autre dynamique en définissant un comportement supplémentaire de l&#39;agent : </p>

<p>- marquer (d&#39;une unité de marquage) chaque case empruntée par l&#39;agent dans une marche aléatoire. (note 10) </p>

<p>11. Procéder à un lacher d&#39;un certain nombre d&#39;agents, aléatoirement positionnés initialement dans l&#39;espace E2D rempli de ressources. Produire l&#39;espace final, résultant d&#39;un nombre suffisant d&#39;itérations, pour voir apparaître des tas et des chemins privilégiés. (note 11) </p>

<p>12. On tentera de rendre les unités de marquages présentes en chaque case &quot;évaporables&quot;. On procèdera alors à un lacher comme en (question 11). (note 12) </p>

<p>13. On envisage l&#39;extension suivante : passage de dim(E2D) = 50x50 à dim(ET2D) = 1000x1000 (par exemple). On évaluera la difficulté de la chose et on proposera une méthode pour remédier éventuellement à ces difficultés. </p>

<p>14. On envisage la disparition progressive des ressources (qu&#39;elles soient dans un tas ou non) au cours du temps et apparition aléatoire d&#39;une même quantité de ressources. On regardera quelle influence ce phénomène a sur les simulations précédentes. </p>

<p>15. On envisage la visualisation des agents (et pas seulement des traces de leurs déplacements) sur la grille représentant E2D et la gestion en temps réel (à chaque instant du cycle) de leurs positions (ie: les voir se déplacer). </p>

<p>16. On souhaite disposer d&#39;une interface d&#39;utilisation conviviale de définition, de paramétrage, d&#39;exécution, d&#39;interruption et d&#39;affichage des résultats de cette application</p>

 summary : <p>ProtoHaptic: An Interactive Haptic Prototyping Tool  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>More screenshots... </p>

<p>What is ProtoHaptic?ProtoHaptic is an interactive haptic prototyping application which supports SensAble haptic devices. </p>

<p>The program is built upon the existing OpenHaptics APIs and facilitates the interactive construction and manipulation of a three dimensional environment that can both be seen on screen and felt via the force feedback haptic device. </p>

<p>Primitive objects may be added and positioned in the scene and various familiar transformations such as scaling and rotation applied to them. In addition to the usual geometric operations the editor provides the ability to change the haptic properties of the scene such as the stiffness of an object, or the lateral friction produced by a surface. </p>

<p>It is intended that the final product will provide a user friendly alternative to programing, for the purposes of rapidly prototyping a haptic environment. </p>

<p>For more information, read on or check out the documentation (Project Report, Short Paper at HAID 2006, User Manual and more...) in the dowloads section. </p>

<p>Executables are also available in the downloads section, while the source code is available via SVN (details the source section). </p>

<p>FeaturesPrimitive Objects: Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Triangle, Torus. Transformations: Translation, Scaling, Rotation and other object specific transformations. Real time editing of haptic properties: Stiffness, Static Friction, Dynamic Friction and Damping. Rigid body dynamics and collision detection for creating dynamic haptic scenes Export code for created scenes: C Code using OpenGL API, C++ Code using AbstractModel API Import code to create scene: C++ Code using AbstractModel API, C++ Code using GHOST API BackgroundProtoHaptic was originally designed and implemented as a project forming part of my undergraduate course at the University of Glasgow, supervised by Dr Steven A Wall. I now use the application fairly regularly as a tool for haptic research and development in my work at The Royal Veterinary College. I have continued to work on some features as and when I have required them. </p>

<p>Applications of ProtoHapticAlthough the applications of such an direct manipulation editor are deliberately as diverse as possible, it is envisaged that it would be particularly useful in the following scenarios. </p>

<p>The rapid prototyping of haptic interfaces for immediate user testing. The iterative development and refinement of specialist simulations by non-computing scientists. E.g. Medical/Veterinary training simulations. Prototyping experimental procedure, say in psychological research. Designing three dimensional models for use in external applications or games. Whilst working at The Royal Veterinary College as a software developer / haptic researcher, I have used ProtoHaptic for: </p>

<p>Allowing a vet student to develop a cat’s abdomen palpation simulator (without the need to learn how to program). Allowing another vet student to design haptic models for a haptic pulse simulator. Designing haptic models for other haptic applications written using the AbstractModel API. Converting old legacy GHOST code to AbstractModel API code using import/export features</p>

 summary : <p>Developing an open-source Python implementation of the Fast Multipole Algorithm (FMM) for scientific applications.The FMM can be used in many scientific computing applications: the simulation of many stars, electrostatics, the calculation of atoms or molecules out of equilibrium, and particle methods for continuum problems. The advantages of the FMM can be huge when large numbers of particles are involved, as it reduces the complexity of calculations from O(N2) to O(N).  </p>

<p>A more widespread adoption of the FMM algorithm has not occurred, mainly due to the complexity of the algorithm and the considerable programming effort, when compared with other algorithms like particle-mesh methods, or treecodes providing O(N log N) complexity.  </p>

<p>We are developing an open source implementation of the FMM —with particular application to the calculation of a velocity field induced by N vortex particles. </p>

<p>February 2008 -- at this time, we release a stable alfa version of the Python code, and invite interested parties to email us if they would like to collaborate with us on further developments. </p>

<p>We distribute this code under the MIT License, giving potential users the greatest freedom possible.  We do, however, request fellow scientists that if they use our codes in research, they kindly include us in the acknowledgement of their papers.  We do not request gratuitous citations;  only cite our articles if you deem it warranted. </p>

<p>Publications&quot;Characterization of the errors of the FMM in particle simulations&quot;  by Felipe A. Cruz and L. A. Barba.  Preprint uploaded to ArXiv on 10 September 2008. 
<br/>Although the literature on the subject provides theoretical error bounds for the FMM approximation, there are not many reports of the measured errors in a suite of computational experiments.  We have performed such an experimental investigation, and summarized the results of about 1000 calculations using the FMM algorithm, to characterize the accuracy of the method in relation with the different parameters available to the user.  In addition to the more standard diagnostic of the maximum error, we supply illustrations of the spatial distribution of the errors, which offers visual evidence of all the contributing factors to the overall approximation accuracy: multipole expansion, local expansion, hierarchical spatial decomposition (interaction lists, local domain, far domain). This presentation is a contribution to any researcher wishing to incorporate the FMM acceleration to their application code, as it aids in understanding where accuracy is gained or compromised.

 summary : <p>ρ-VEX: A Reconfigurable and Extensible VLIW ProcessorThis is the project website for ρ-VEX, an open source VLIW processor with an accompanied development framework. The project started as the MSc project of Thijs van As. </p>

<p>About ρ-VEXρ-VEX is an open source reconfigurable and extensible Very-Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processor, accompanied by a development framework consisting of a VEX assembler, ρ-ASM. The processor architecture is based on the VEX ISA, as introduced by J.A. Fisher et al.. The VEX ISA offers a scalable technology platform for embedded VLIW processors, that allows variation in many aspects, including instruction issue-width, organization of functional units, and instruction set. The ρ-VEX source code is described in VHDL. ρ-ASM is written in C. </p>

<p>A software development compiler toolchain for VEX is made publicly available by Hewlett-Packard. The reasons VEX was chosen as the ISA are merely its extensibility and the quality of the available compiler. The design provides mechanisms that allow parametric extensibility of ρ-VEX. Both reconfigurable operations, as well as the versatility of VEX machine models are supported by ρ-VEX. The processor and framework are targeted at VLIW prototyping research and  embedded processor design. </p>

<p>The name ρ-VEX stands for &#39;reconfigurable VEX&#39; processor. Because the letter Rho (P or ρ) is the Greek analogous for the Roman R or r, ρ-VEX is pronounced as r-VEX. This is also the correct spelling when no Greek letters can be used (as is the case with the project website URL). </p>

<p>Getting StartedTo start experimenting with ρ-VEX, read the QuickstartGuide and download the latest code snapshot, or checkout trunk. When you have a Xilinx University Program Virtex-II Pro Board by Digilent, you should have ρ-VEX running within moments. </p>

 title : The anachronox-modding Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The best place to go to find out about Anachronox is the Wikipedia page.  If you still wish to find out more take a look at the Anachrodox. </p>

<p>No game assets are included here. </p>

<p>In order to work on these tools you will need to either download the demo and work with that or purchase one of the current budget releases of this game. In order to create a mod for Anachronox which others can play, you will need to purchase the game. This project currently includes the following elements: </p>

<p>AnoxToolsA Python library which allows reading many of the custom formats used for various purposes within the game data. </p>

<p>Most notably this includes a decompiler for the compiled APE game logic scripts.  As of the 9th of April 2007 this can be successfully used to decompile all the APE scripts which come with the game well enough to allow their recompilation with the script compiler the original game programmers released. </p>

<p>BspViewerA quick and dirty attempt at a viewer for the compiled BSP maps which come with Anachronox.  It was based on a version of the nedu 3D demo/game engine which wrapped PyOpenGL.  As such it is not readily usable and may require a bit of leg work to get it working. </p>

<p>nAnachronoxAn experiment to create a viewer for the custom Anachronox MD2 model format using the Nebula Device 3d engine.  It was taken far enough to exhibit standard model viewing functionality where a model could be viewed and rotated, so as to admire how much better it looked under Nebula than in the original Quake 2 derived game engine.</p>

 title : The beesiege Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The game idea is this. Life was good for the bees and their queen. They lived in their hive making honey and having fun. Until one day a spoiled little teenager threw his cigarette underneath the hive which caught on fire. Now the bees are left with no home and they have to travel through the forest to find a new place to live. But they are going to face a lot of challenges on their way… </p>

<p>The player controls the queen bee and her soldiers are following her at all times. Throughout the forest there are going to be a lot of enemies that will make the player’s life difficult. The queen is not able to attack, because that’s not her purpose in life, so she depends on her soldiers to protect her. Whenever an enemy is nearby the queen (player) will be able to select a number of bees and command them to destroy that enemy. The bees that survive the challenge will return to the queen. Of course many of them will die so a number of power ups is going to be distributed around the forest. When the queen makes it to the new hive the level ends. If the queen dies then it is game over. </p>

<p>Now just to give you an idea of how the game is going to look like, think of Wing Commander. Only replace the spaceship with the queen and the missiles with bees. Of course bees will not be shot at the enemy, they are going to move there at their own speed and attack him. </p>

<p>I am very excited about this project because it features various new stuff. First of all I do not know of any game that has a similar story / goal. Also I do not know of any game that uses this attack mechanism. Also the game features a very interesting animation mechanism. We use Behavioral Animation to move the bees around, which means that every bee or game character has a controller that generates forces and torques which drive the character. These forces and torques vary depening on the behavior that we are implementing. Behaviors include </p>

<p>Seek: the object travels to a target at maximun speed Arrival: the object travels to the target while slowing down until it reaches it Wander: the object moves in random directions within a radius Separation: the object is keeping a distance from its surrounding objects Allignment: the object follows the general direction of its neighbors The nice thing about these individual behaviors is that you can combine them and get more complex behaviors like Flocking where the objects form groups and also have a randomness to their movement like actual bird flocks. Behavioral Animation is not a new idea however what is original in our implementations is that these forces and torques that the controllers generate are given to Ageia’s PhysX which then takes care of the simulation and moves the objects. The effect of all that is very realistic movement.. You actually think that these are actual bees you see on the screen. </p>

<p>Another cool thing in my opinion will be the simplicity of the game. The player only controls the queen and everything else is AI. Of course it is more than that, the player will have to make decisions that will affect his chances of survival, but still the gameplay is very simple and fun.</p>

 title : The cytoseg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>VisionThis project is based on the Monster Milktruck example from Google and extends this idea by introducing several features needed for a multiplayer game framework. </p>

<p>The idea is to use this framework as a basis for driving (and possibly other first and third-person) games that take place in the Google Earth world and the real world with interfaces to static and mobile clients. </p>

<p>Basically we try to create a space where the real and the virtual world can come together and play. </p>

<p>Starting PointsUse the featured Wiki pages on the right as a starting point for the project. A current working version of the code can be accessed online here (For now it only works with the Internet Explorer. We try to keep it up to date when server code comes into play) or downloaded on the right. YaadaaWe are always looking for people who like open source software and want to participate and toss in good ideas and code. See this wiki page on how to contact us. </p>

 title : The depsolver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NEWS (2008-11-10) Bugfix release 2.1 available for download in patch and full version forms. It fixes a mistake in the multipolar calculation of orders 2 and 3 for quadratic triangular elements. All previous versions have been marked as Deprecated to avoid confusion, but they are still available for download for those who need them for development purposes (go to downloads and select &quot;All Downloads&quot; then click &quot;Search&quot;). </p>

<p>DescriptiondepSolver is a Boundary Element Method solver for Laplace&#39;s  equation in 3D AC electrostatic problems. I originally wrote this program to study the characteristics of different dielectrophoretic trap designs. A big advantage of using this code to calculate dielectrophoretic forces is that the user can specify which approximation to use for the calculation of the force. In this manner, without having to change anything in the code, one can use a simple dipolar or quadrupolar approximation to quickly explore the force generated on a sphere over a large volume of space, or use the more general calculation based on the integration of the Maxwell&#39;s stress tensor over an arbitrarily shaped particle. </p>

<p>depSolver is convenient for dielectrophoretic force calculations, but it is in no way limited to them. It can be used to solve a wide variety of electrostatic problems as long as they involve conductors were the electric potential is specified and all dielectrics in the system can be considered as piecewise homogeneous. The source code is written in C and uses separate functions for most tasks in order to make modifications easier.</p>

 title : The ellipsoids Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ellipsoidal Toolbox for MATLABEllipsoidal Toolbox (ET)  is a standalone set of easy-to-use configurable MATLAB routines to perform operations with ellipsoids and hyperplanes of arbitrary dimensions. It computes the external and internal ellipsoidal approximations of geometric (Minkowski) sums and differences of ellipsoids, intersections of ellipsoids and intersections of ellipsoids with halfspaces and polytopes; distances between ellipsoids, between ellipsoids and hyperplanes, between ellipsoids and polytopes; and projections onto given subspaces. </p>

<p>Ellipsoidal methods are used to compute forward and backward reach sets of continuous- and discrete-time piecewise affine systems. Forward and backward reach sets can be also computed for piecewise linear systems with disturbances. It can be verified if computed reach sets intersect with given ellipsoids, hyperplanes, or polytopes. </p>

<p>The toolbox provides efficient plotting routines for ellipsoids, hyperplanes and reach sets.   Required software: MATLAB 6.5 (or higher). </p>

<p>ET is also distributed as part of Multi-Parametric Toolbox (MPT). </p>

<p>Refinement of Ellipsoidal Approximation  It starts approximating the reach set with one external (blue) and one internal (green) ellipsoids, then the number of approximating ellipsoids is doubled – now there are two external and two internal, then it is doubled again – now there are four of each, finally, there are 32 external and 32 internal ellipsoids.   Switching System  The dynamics of the system changes every 5 seconds. For the first system, the external approximation is blue and internal – yellow; for the second, the external approximation is red and internal – green; for the third, the external approximation is magenta and internal – cyan. The set of initial conditions for the second system is the reach set of the first one, and the set of initial conditions for the third system – the reach set of the second one.   Switching System in 3D  Tthis example is similar to the previous one, only this time it is 3-dimensional system with one switch.   Reaching Boundary Point  This example illustrates how moving along the good curve using known control, we reach the boundary point of the reach set at given time.   Reaching Internal Point  By squeezing the set of controls and computing &#39;good curves&#39; for the squeezed set, we can steer the system to any internal point of the reach set at given time.   Choosing Control Based on Reach Set Information  The control can be chosen based on the reach set computed for the next time interval. Here, the black dot chooses where to go, knowing its reach set 5 seconds ahead. The reach set is displayed in red for external, and blue – for internal approximation.   Reach Set Info in 3D  This example is similar to the previous one, only in 3D.  </p>

 title : The mdlutility2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A 2D and 3D finite element formulation for modeling bulk metal forming procesess using a rigid-viscoplastic material model (flow formulation) was developed. Its main features are: it is based on an Eulerian description of the material flow implemented using the pseudo-concentration method; it allows the coupling of the elastic and thermo-elastic deformation of the forming tools and includes, in the model of material under deformation, the thermo-mechanical coupling. The developed formulation was implemented in the finite element code METFOR. This code was applied to the analysis of: the hot rolling of flat products, the vertical rolling of slabs (edging) and the hot upsetting of cylindrical samples. The features of this formulation, described above, were fundamental for the profile and flatness analysis of the hot rolled products because it is necessary to take into account the rolls deformation due to thermal and mechanical (bending and flattening) loading. The technological application of the developed formulation allowed its validation through the comparison of its predictions with the measurements performed by the process engineers of an industrial hot rolling mill.</p>

 summary : <p>ml278The goal of the application was to demonstrate the transition of a user-controlled vehicle from the vastness of space down to a detailed planet surface. This is to be done continuously in a real-time rendered 3d-world without &quot;loading&quot;-screens or other distractions. </p>

<p>The application is composed out of several free software components: </p>

<p>OGRE Bullet OIS QuickGUI </p>

<p>To implement the way the planet is rendered, we have created our own scene manager for OGRE, which inherits some functionality from the Octree scene manager. This scene manager can be a useful component, for other projects that renders planets in OGRE. </p>

<p>Currently, the application takes the form of a rather limited &quot;tech-demo&quot;, but could be expanded into a game in the future. </p>

<p>3D Planetary SurveyorThe initial contribution to this project is the result of a student project at Vestfold University College (Norway). Its homepage can be found at (will not be altered after July 2008): </p>

<p>http://ri-pro.hive.no/prosjekter/da2008-04/ </p>

<p>Installing/compilingCurrently, the Windows binary is the easiest way to try the application. If you are on a GNU/Linux-platform, compiling it manually is probably the way to go. More information on this can be found in the README-files and will also be added here later. Be aware that you currently must have a graphics card with Shader Model 3.0 support to run the application, and OpenGL is the primary rendering system used. The project uses a CMake build system, but you need to have necessary dependencies installed.</p>

 title : The progressive-meshes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>progressive-meshes is a surface simplification software which produces high-quality approximations of triangle progressive meshes models. It generates progressive meshes models with desired number of mesh faces or compression ratio, and every contraction is recorded in the generated file. Currently only core operators of .smf input file format are supported. </p>

<p>This is a C++ implementation of Michael Garland&#39;s Surface simplification using quadric error metrics and Hugues Hoppe&#39;s Progressive meshes. This software runs slower than Garland&#39;s Qslim, but the results are somehow better in details. Since every contraction is recorded, further usage of the generated .pm file could be extended, for example, building level-of-detail models or 3D streaming. </p>

 summary : <p>3D-data in Astronomy means 2 spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension, i.e. having a spectrum for each pixel of your &#39;image&#39;. </p>

<p>This code is a loose collection of tools that uses numpy, pylab (former matplotlib) and scipy to handle these 3D-data, perform various operations on them and visualise them. Interactive classes are provided for manually manipulating certain routines. </p>

<p>The main use is to measure the kinematics of galaxies (therefore the name PyGalKin), both from Fabry-Perot observations of the H-alpha line and from integral field unit spectra. </p>

<p>The code is probably not usable without reading the source; documentation is lacking or non-existing. However, Python is highly readable and there should no high obstacles, especially for users of numpy, scipy and pylab, which become more and more common in astronomy as replacements for IDL and/or older data handling software. </p>

<p>The gameThe &quot;Tic Tac Turn&quot;-game is loosely based on the famous &quot;Tic Tac Toe&quot;-game, but differs in the fact that the game is played on a 2x2 (or 3x3) field of individual &quot;Tic Tac Toe&quot;-boards, also referred to as blocks. With each turn, the player rotates a block clock- or counter-clockwise and puts his/her symbol on any of the available places. The game can be played with a maximum of 4 people, and the goal is to win by having 4 (for a 2x2 field) or 5 (for a 3x3 field) symbols in a row. </p>

<p>The implementationWe decided to put our OpenGL knowledge to the test and write a fully 3D version of the game in the time we had. The application is well-structed, contains a lot of documentation and follows the Model-view-controller design pattern. The OpenGL functionality is provided by JOGL, a low-level OpenGL wrapper for Java, and can be ran on any platform that is supported. </p>

<p>The application consists of two parts, which can be accessed by the launcher (see below): </p>

<p>Dedicated server: capable of hosting multiple games, handling challenges (requests from clients to join private games), kicking clients. Client: capable of querying and joining servers, single-player games (against the built-in AI player), multi-player games, challenging other clients, chatting, requesting hints, and more. </p>

<p>Version:1.0 Beta </p>

<p>RequirementsMSAgent Genie Model Find it in the downloads section  .NET Framework 2 Internet Explorer 6+ JavaScript should be enabled. Features:You can search the same query both in live maps and google maps. Wikimapia support will be added soon. For example, enter pizza in what column and hyderabad in where column and search. The map view will be automatically updated in three engines, so that user can quickly refer the information. User can mark locations as favourite places. Can add the information for them. But this changes are local. These changes will not appear on the internet. Users can directly view the traffic changes by a single click. Mini Map view is also supported. 3D view is also supported for virtual earth maps. But you have to install a plugin called virtual earth 3D.  Different views of the map are also supported like road, aerial, hybrid etc.,  All the useful actions are added in the action toolbar placed at the bottom. Start Help tour from Help-&gt;Help tour for help. Limitations:Since, I used COM to javascript communication, you might face some problems if you start different operations at a time. As there is some delay in release of Wikimapia api, We embedded the whole site as it is. So, some functionalities are not available in virtual earth app. Integrating the google maps is also incomplete. All these limitations will be fixed in the next release hopefully. Locate Me functionality is currently not available. Layers module is also not completed and will be added in the next release. You can mark favourites only in virtual Earth and default zoom level is 10.

 summary : <p>Tools to read DVD-Video filesystems. </p>

<p>DVD-VideoA consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD-ROM discs. </p>

<p>File SystemThe basis for the DVD-Video filesystem is the Universal Disk Format (UDF) specification.  UDF defines data structures such as volumes, files, blocks, sectors, CRCs, paths, records, allocation tables, partitions, character sets and time stamps. </p>

<p>The UDF (ISO/IEC 13346, ECMA-167) specification was created by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA). </p>

<p>File and Folder StructureThere may be up to two folders at the root level of the disk with the names VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS.  The files for a DVD-Video disk are in the VIDEO_TS directory.  The AUDIO_TS directory is reservered for DVD-Audio disks, another of the standards controlled by the DVD Forum. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All of the files for a DVD-Video disk are in the single directory VIDEO_TS. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Video ManagerThe mandatory file VIDEO_TS.IFO contains the Video Manager (VMG) structures.  A backup is stored in the mandatory file VIDEO_TS.BUP. </p>

<p>Video Title SetEach DVD-Video disk may contain one or more distinct collections of video known as a Video Title Set (VTS).  A file named VIDEO_nn_0.IFO, where nn is the two digit number of the title, contains the Video Title Set structures. </p>

<p>Video ObjectA Video Object (VOB) is the container format for video, audio, subtitles and menus in DVD-Video.  It is a strict subset of the MPEG-2 Program Stream format. </p>

<p>Logical Structure </p>

<p>The logical structure of a DVD-Video divides it into titles. For example a disk might contain a feature movie in one title and a &quot;making of&quot; feature in a second title. There may be up to 99 titles. </p>

<p>Titles contain one or more chapters, otherwise known as parts. A chapter might represent a scene or an act in a film. There may be up to 999 parts in a title. </p>

<p>Each chapter contains one or more programs. Navigation is done using programs, a player command of &quot;previous&quot; or &quot;next&quot; selects the corresponding program. </p>

<p>Each program contains one or more cells. A cell is the smallest element used in authoring. </p>

<p>Cells contain many Video Object Units (VOBU). A VOBU is a self contained Group of Pictures in an MPEG program stream containing a few seconds of video. </p>

<p>The logical and physical data structures converge at the cell level. </p>

<p>Virtual MachineThe DVD-Video format allows for non-linear playback using graphical menus. A player implements a virtual machine (VM) which runs bytecode commands contained within Program Chains (PGC). </p>

<p>Each title contains up to 999 program chains. A PGC contains up to 99 programs. A program is an ordered collection of pointers to cells. A simple program chain may play the cells containing a film from start to finish. </p>

<p>A program chain may contain commands to be executed before playback of the first cell, after the playback of the last cell or before each cell. There may be up to 128 commands in a PGC. There may be commands and no programs and cells. A PGC with no commands and no programs and cells does nothing.</p>

 summary : <p>The project consists in develop a software that creates a link with FlightGear flight simulator over Telnet protocol and permits the control of a Cessna c172p (automatic fly by wire). </p>

<p>The target of this software is more general of controlling the Cessna, infact the user can select another airveichle model in FlightGear and integrate a controller by Telnet interface. </p>

<p>FlightGear integrates a Telnet server. The user of this flight simulator can use a telnet client and make changes in the tree of variables of the flight dynamics engine. </p>

<p>In particular, it&#39;s possible to measure the orientation of the airplane and set the right commands for flaps. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to study a controller that stabilize the direction of the ariplane and, for example, set the altitude or change its course in a fully automatic way. </p>

<p>In the end, with this remote framework, we make two tests. One is for find the maximum frequency of the controller loop and the other is for validate our controller. </p>

 summary : <p>Build a resilient and robust distributed application that supports a simple order and fulfilment process for a chain of franchise video stores. </p>

<p>The video chain has shops and warehouses located across the country; and also has a central office that provides common services to the rest of the organisation. Customers can search for and order videos over the Internet, or go to their local store to browse and place orders for videos. Each store will run its own copy of the order process for handling locally-placed orders. Each warehouse will run its own copy of the delivery process to look after delivery requests it receives, and its own copy of the stock process to keep track of the goods it has on its shelves. Orders will be placed using a local store ordering system and result in delivery requests being sent to an appropriate warehouses which then will then send the ordered goods directly to the customer.</p>
 summary : <p>If you have a video that you would like to put on your iPod, you will most likely want to convert it to a compatible format, and you will most likely also want to lower its quality -- including shrinking the resolution of the video. </p>

<p>This is where this software comes into place. All you have to do is calculate the aspect ratio of your video, or even give the ratio on the form of either &quot;WIDTHxHEIGHT,&quot; &quot;width/height,&quot; or &quot;width:height,&quot; and tell it to iPodRes which will then give you suggestions on which resolution you should choose for your video when converting. </p>

<p>Note: This software is not a video converter, it just suggests video resolutions. </p>

<p>The requisites that the resolution calculator requires of the resolutions it suggests is that both the width and height values are evenly divisible by 8; that the height does not exceed 240 px (for videos where the width is greater than the height) and that the width does not exceed 320 (for videos where the height is greater than the width); and the suggested resolutions&#39; aspect ratio must not differ more than 5 % from the aspect ratio of the original video (or else it will start to look odd, so I&#39;ve read... somewhere). </p>

<p>The program will not choose a resolution for you -- you will have to do this yourself. (The program does however limit the suggestions to the five-percent aspect ratio error.) The reason for this is that the program cannot know whether a user prefers to have an aspect ratio as close to the original as possible, or if it would rather have a larger resolution for the video. So read the output and make the right decision for you! </p>

<p>Installation notes: </p>

<p>$ javac iPodRes.javaExamples: </p>

<p>1) $ java iPodRes 16:9
<br/>===== iPod VIDEO RESOLUTION CALCULATOR =====
<br/>Ratio: 16:9 = 1.7777777777777777</p>

<p>328 / 16:9 = 184, AR % error: 0.2717391304347838, res: 328x184
<br/>368 / 16:9 = 208, AR % error: 0.48076923076922906, res: 368x208
<br/>384 / 16:9 = 216, AR % error: 0.0, res: 384x216</p>

<p>2) $ java iPodRes 672x480
<br/>===== iPod VIDEO RESOLUTION CALCULATOR =====
<br/>Ratio: 7:5 = 1.4</p>

<p>336 / 7:5 = 240, AR % error: 0.0, res: 336x240In example 1) above, the ratio was given of the form &quot;width:height&quot;. We see that there are three suggestions in total: 328x184 with an aspect ratio error of about 0.27, which is fairly low; 368x208 with an AR % error of about 0.48, which is higher than the previous, although the resolution is larger which means higher quality. Now, I would pick AR over size, because the screen of the iPod is so small anyway, so I&#39;d take the first one if I had to pick between the two. Yet, there is one left: 384x216 with an AR % error of 0.0, which means it&#39;s a perfect resizing of the picture when it comes to maintaining the aspect ratio! And it so happens that it&#39;s the largest resolution of the three suggestions, so I shall pick that one! </p>

<p>In example 2), the ratio was given as a video resolution. In this case there is only one suggestion which fulfills the previously mentioned requisites: 336x240. It turns out that we were lucky this time, because as is visible, the error is zero, which means the original video&#39;s aspect ratio will be maintained with the suggested resolution! </p>

<p>Usage environment: I hope this software can come to use for someone. It&#39;s not too complicated at all; it&#39;s not really that fancy, but it does the trick for me. I use it in combination with a script I created that uses the free software &quot;ffmpeg&quot; to convert videos. I just feed the resolution of the original video to iPodRes, choose the best resolution according to my needs, then I feed the video file name and selected iPod video resolution to the script, and it does the encoding for me. </p>

<p>Feel free to copy, distribute or modify the software to your needs if you so wish. If you do, though, do so under the terms of the license, and, if you would, send me an e-mail with a patch of the changes and an explanation of what has been changed and why! :-) </p>

<p>Thanks, and happy usage!</p>
 title : The ipodres Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My goal with this project is to write a native windows app, using C# (mainly because thats what I know).   </p>

<p>The purpose in this app is to make a dead simple video conversion app, initially aimed at converting MKV (Matroska) files, with subtitles, to specific formats (I&#39;m picking iPhone first).  If all goes well, I will try and add more formats and more target devices later.  This will basically for people who don&#39;t know and don&#39;t care about video codec settings, but just want to drag and drop multiple files to be converted for another device.   </p>

<p>I started this app because I can&#39;t find any apps that handle MKV files with subtitles halfway intelligently to convert for me to watch on my iPhone. </p>

<p>Later on, if all goes well, I also might consider porting it over to be cross-platform using Mono.</p>

 title : The video-player-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to The Video Player Project!  This project makes use of the FLTK C++ library to create a simple &quot;video&quot; player. </p>

<p>IntroductionHello.  The Video Player Project is a work in progress created by students at the Florida Institute of Technology for an introductory C++ course, CSE 2050.  The goal of the project is to create a GUI interface using C++ and a library called FLTK.  We are to incorporate usual video player features to play a series of pictures one after another.     </p>

<p>NewsHow we&#39;re doing so far... </p>

<p>Tuesday, February 26, 2008:  </p>

<p>Google Code page created! Familiarized with code page and FLTK libraries First upload of video player code snippets. </p>

<p>Thursday, February 28, 2008: </p>

<p>Class hierarchy designed File chooser for opening multiple images created Box created and added to window to display the images </p>

<p>Friday, February 29, 2008: </p>

<p>Big changes to the project Added two new data structures to facilitate the video player The project now has separate objects for a list of images and a single image </p>

<p>Wednesday, March 5, 2008 </p>

<p>Still having a big problem with the FLTK libraries.  We are having trouble displaying an image on the screen because of some compilation flags Changed a good deal of the code around, cleaned up some commenting, and removed obsolete variables </p>

<p>Thursday, March 6, 2008 </p>

<p>We&#39;ve fixed the compilation problem with Dev-C++.  The project now compiles successfully without errors.  However, the program crashes immediately upon being run Changed the ImageFrame class to now support all types of images via the Fl_Shared_Image library </p>

<p>MAJOR UPDATE FOR MARCH 6, 2008The program is up and running once again.  Our code compiles and executes properly We have figured out how to attach and display an image in a box The ImageFrame class has been changed back to JPEG support only.  The documentation for Fl_Shared_Image was misinterpreted Friday, March 7, 2008 </p>

<p>Removed unnecessary includes and method calls from the files without images in them. Added more buttons and associated every button with a callback function. The callback functions work, they just need to be actually coded. Removed old reference code that was no longer needed. Centered the buttons on the window. Changed small bit of code that will probably prevent problems in the future. Added getCurrentFrame() method to FrameList. </p>

<p>Saturday, March 8, 2008 </p>

<p>Coded all of the functions for the buttons. Buttons should work as soon as we get the pictures to load. </p>

<p>Wednesday, March 12, 2008 </p>

<p>Changed everything back to Fl::repeat_timeout() </p>

<p>Thursday, March 13, 2008 </p>

<p>Changed everything possible to strings. Changed storage method so that instead of storing all of the images, it now stores their locations. Image is created when getImage() is called. </p>

<p>Sunday, March 16, 2008 </p>

<p>The video player portion of the project has been completed at revision 107 The player is capable of handling BMP images The program successfully loads up a series of images and plays back at 30 FPS All buttons work as intended Work will now begin on minor debugging and the second part of the project </p>

<p>Tuesday, March 18, 2008 </p>

<p>Second part of the project begins! The video player will now be used for detection of objects in motion Project details can be found in PDF format here </p>

<p>Saturday, March 22, 2008 </p>

<p>Added CustomImage.h to the project The header file is used in motion detection </p>

<p>Tuesday, April 1, 2008 </p>

<p>The project works as intended The video sequence can be shown in grayscale or with only moving objects Work will now begin on creating a box around moving objects </p>

<p>Tuesday, April 22, 2008 It&#39;s been a while since an update has been posted... </p>

<p>The player and all functions now work correctly The video player can play normally, grayscale, show difference, label images, and box moving images Hooray </p>

 summary : <p>It is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer&#39;s charges at a video store. The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long. It then calculates the charges, which depend on how long the movie is rented, and identifies the type movie. There are three kinds of movies: regular, children&#39;s, and new releases. In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether the film is a new release.</p>

 title : The fit4data Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutFIT4Data is a testing framework for data management applications built on the Java implementation of FIT.  It allows developers to write FIT-like tests using the programming language of their choice.  This is essential in the ETL domain where the key technical skills are UNIX scripting and the ETL language used on the project and most developers do not know Java (or any other OO language) so they cannot be expected to write fixtures in the usual fashion.   </p>

<p>For example, if you are an Ab Initio developer, you can use FIT4Data to specify input data sets and tests to run against the system under test using some slightly modified FIT fixtures and connectors provided as part of this project using FIT4Data&#39;s command line interface. </p>

<p>You test results will be written in an easy to read HTML format like this... </p>

 title : The ringide Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ring IDE, described as an Open Source pluggable, multiplatform and stable integrated development environment has the main goal of integrating a set of tools to make easier developing games in Fenix. One of the main goals that distingish this from other IDEs is that Ring IDE will focus mainly in supporting as many fenix file formats as possible, delegating to a second place the code editor. The reason for that is that one can write code more or less confortable in any code editor but there are no similar tools for Fenix file formats. Ring Ide is built under the phylosophy of “One IDE to rule them all”, an idea partially taken from the project Flamebird (another Open Source project for creating a Fenix IDE in which I participated) </p>

<p>And what about fenixlib? fenixlib is a class library (writen in Java) whose aim is to support Fenix File formats in java in an easy way. With these library, any Java programmer can manipulate easily Map, Fbm, Fpl, etc. files. The purpose is to encourage Fenix users with Java knoweldedges to write its own GUI tools as well as providing a separated library to be used in Ring IDE. </p>

<p>Currently the project is in an alpha state: fenixlib is completed for about a 35% (Map, Fpl, Pal, and Fbm support is included) and the Ring IDE is still in an envision phase. Ring IDE development will not start until fenixlib is in a mature state - say 70% - however, simple (but helpful) tools are being developed at the same time as the fenixlib.</p>

 title : The scion-lib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A wrapper around the GHC API to provide IDE functionality. </p>

<p>For a variety of reasons there is no standard IDE for Haskell programmers.  Many Haskell programmers use Vim or Emacs, but many others use Visual Studio, Eclipse, Yi or various other editors.  There are efforts to provide IDE functionality for each of these platforms, leading to large duplication of efforts.  Maintaining each of these libraries is not feasible or negates the addition of new features. </p>

<p>Scion (rhymes with &quot;lion&quot;) is an IDE library, i.e., it does not provide a user interface, but rather an API for IDEs.  Scion provides: </p>

<p>A Haskell library that is higher-level than the GHC API (and can be changed independently of the GHC API.)  Furthermore, it aims to abstract over changes in the GHC API (wherever reasonably possible.) For frontends not written in Haskell, Scion provides a server that exposes as much of the Haskell API as possible.  The server uses JSON as the wire protocol since it is simple and libraries are available for a very wide range of systems. The goal is that new IDE features are added to Scion once and frontends need just implement the front-end specific code, thus minimising the amount of work for IDE maintainers. </p>

<p>Scion&#39;s main repository is hosted on Github.  If you have a Github account just click the &quot;fork&quot; button.  Otherwise you can get a copy via: </p>

In other words we define the classes and methods&#39; contract using tests, while also keeping track of tests that need to be run when a class/method under test has been modified. This is possible by collecting metadata sets that represent links between classes under test and test classes (and eventually more fine grained links between methods) and using them for a lot of purposes.

<p>AudioBlank Plugin PackAudioBlank Plugin Pack consists of VST and JS plugins which don&#39;t do any audio processing. However, they have neat GUI which simulate a Music/Audio hardware. </p>

<p>AudioBlank Marshall MG15-CD graphically simulates Guitar amplifier Marshall MG 15 CD. It does not process the audio in any way. But it&#39;s useful for keeping the amp configuration while miking the amp.  </p>

<p>We tweak the knobs and switches in the actual amp (EQ, Volumes, Overdrive/Clean, FDD on/off etc.) to get the desired the sound  and mic the amp. If we want to continue the same recording later, we have to recreate the same settings in the amp. Otherwise we can not achieve the same tone. </p>

<p>Once you are happy with your tone in the amp, before hitting record </p>

<p>Insert AudiobBlank Marshall MG15-CD in the track Tweak the plugin so that it reflects your actual settings in the amp.  Hit record </p>

<p>Your host will save the settings along with the plugin. Later if you wish to continue the same track, fire up the plugin from the track, set your amp according to the plugin.</p>

 title : The bluez-pulseaudio Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pulseaudio is a networked sound server, for both POSIX and Win32 systems. It acts like a proxy for sound applications. With it is possible to do software mixing of different audio streams (even if they are on different machines), transfer an audio stream between different machines over the network, change the sample format or channel count, among other things. </p>

<p>The benefit of integrating the Bluetooth Audio service into pulseaudio is that will be possible to make connections between the bluetooth audio streams and other audio streams on the computer. In example, it would be possible to have two people, each one with one bluetooth headset (or one bluetooth and one wired headset), talking on the same record channel of a VoIP application, mixing the two audio streams coming from the headsets into one that goes into the VoIP application. </p>

<p>In addition, would be also possible to have pulseAudio to control your bluetooth audio streams, lowering the volume of your (bluetooth or not) speakers and activating your headset when you receive a call on your VoIP system.</p>
 summary : <p>The program is an audio extractor and encoder: it interfaces with the DVD device, reads from a DVD Video, and allows the user to extract any audio track from any title/chapter, and encode it in wave, mp3 or ogg. </p>

<p>It acts as a frontend to some command-line tools like MPlayer or Lame. </p>

<p>It uses libdvdread to read a DVD. </p>

<p>This project started as a university project, and now is being adapted for a public release (and maybe for an adding of new functionalities).</p>

 title : The raopd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>raopd is (or more correctly, will be) software to stream audio from a Linux box to an Apple AirPort Express.  The system consists of two pieces.  The first piece is an ALSA kernel driver to provide an audio device for applications to use for audio output.  The second piece is a simple Linux daemon that packages up the stream, encrypts it, and transmits it over the network using the RAOP protocol. </p>

<p>raopd differs from raop_play and JustePort, two other RAOP implementations, in that raopd is not a music player, nor does it have a user interface--it is in many ways a simplified version of raop_play.  It is a kernel module and system daemon.  Audio applications see it as a hardware sound card, and it transmits the audio stream it receives unmodified to the AEX.   </p>

<p>One other significant change, not technical, is that raopd is a pure GPLv3 implementation.  All the code has been written by us, and it depends only on OpenSSL, with an appropriate license exception under the GPLv3 to permit linking against OpenSSL. </p>

<p>One other goal of this project is to create a software package that &quot;just works&quot;.  The module will load and the daemon will be started on boot via an init script, remaining idle until audio data is present, and returning to idle and releasing control of the AirPort when the audio stream ends. </p>

<p>The code is net yet fully functional.  If you&#39;ve arrived here looking for working software, please check back in a month or so.  While the core code works, and we&#39;re able to stream audio to the AirPort, much of the supporting code still remains to be written, and installation is a purely manual process.  Unless you&#39;re a C programmer, there isn&#39;t going to be anything useful or interesting here (and even then, it&#39;s probably not that interesting!)  If you want something that works now, try http://raop-play.sourceforge.net/ or http://nanocr.eu/software/justeport/</p>

 summary : <p>Spectro-Edit reads in regular PCM audio files (currently, only 16-bit mono WAV is supported), then shows you the audio visually in a time vs. frequency plot. </p>

<p>The fun part is, you can &quot;paint out&quot; any part of the visualization and play back the audio subject to your modifications. When you are happy with the result, you can save your work back to a WAV file. </p>

<p>This could be useful for podcasting (edit out microphone noise, chair squeaks, phones ringing, and other background noise), music (make strange and unusual modifications to the sound for artistic reasons), research (visualize animal calls or noise pollution from nearby industrial activity), and general purpose geekery (which is why I made it). </p>

One problem with BioPython is that in order to use it in a powerful way one must be a python developer. This will change this. This will be designed basically to retrieve biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) from online databases, such as NCBI, and bring those sequences into an environment where it is easy to manipulate them. Also, This will interface to BLAST and MEME so that researchers can use these tools as well, integrated with the database lookups. There will be many other features as well such as translating/transcribing DNA, RNA, and protein, visualizing the different sequences, modeling and genetic algorithm support, integrated command line for directly using python to manipulate sequences, and scripting. This will have most, if not all, of the features BioPython has, only instead of a messy code-driven interface, it will be graphical.</p>

 title : The captor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Captor-AO ProjectA Software Product Line (SPL) consists of a set of software systems that share common features and fulfill the specific requirements of a particular domain. In order to make the products instantiation process faster and less prone to errors, the project of a SPL can adopt the utilization of application generators, which can automatically generate the SPL artifacts based on the specification of the variabilities of a particular product. Additionally, it can be noticed that certain crosscutting features of a product line have potencial to be reused in different domains, so they can be implemented using aspect oriented programming (AOP). </p>

<p>In this work, a process is proposed for the development of SPLs and automatic generation of products, considering the crosscutting concerns present in each application domain. The crosscutting concerns are related to the common features that are scattered around program divisions or modules of different domains. The process proposed here has the goal of enhancing the reuse of SPL features using AOP, allowing the design of SPL in a more cohesive way and, thus, easing its maintenance and evolution. Aiming at decreasing the effort needed to instantiate products from these SPL, this work also presents an extension to the Captor application generator, named Captor-AO.  </p>

<p>This generator supports the proposed process, allowing the creation of products composed  by features of different domains. Finally, a case study is presented in which Captor-AO is configured with two domains: a crosscutting domain for the persistence concern and a base domain compatible with this crosscutting domain, such that the generation of products can be done by composing features of both domains.</p>

 title : The checkstyle-idea Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionThis is a CheckStyle plug-in for JetBrain&#39;s IntelliJ IDEA. </p>

<p>At present this plugin is only having high priority fixes applied - if you have the time and inclination to continue feature development please drop me a line. </p>

<p>Unlike JetStyle, this plug-in was original written to provide real-time integration, in a similar manner to Eclipse-CS. From version 0.4 it also provides on-demand scanning for the current file and project. </p>

<p>UsageReal-time scanning is provided as an Inspection. On-demand scanning is available as a tab at (by default) the bottom of the IDEA window. </p>

<p>Configuration for both the inspection and the on-demand scanning is done via the CheckStyle item in the Settings panel. </p>

<p>Click on Real-time Scan and you will be able to specify the report severity and activate the inspection as appropriate. </p>

<p>Current FeaturesIn version 3.x:    </p>

<p>CheckStyle 5.0 support. Per-module configuration. </p>

<p>In version 2.x: </p>

<p>Scan files in real-time with an IDEA inspection. Scan the current file, module or project on demand. Standard Java rules are built in, or specify your own CheckStyle file. Ability to add third party checks to the classpath. Ability to define external properties. Version 1.x is for IDEA6. 2.x is for IDEA 7 and (from 2.2) 8. Both of these support CheckStyle 4 and are no longer maintained. </p>

<p>Version 3 support CheckStyle 5 only, and from 3.0.5 is compatible with IDEA 9. </p>

<p>Current LimitationsThe plugin will throw exceptions if used with class files targeted at a later version than that of the JDK used by IDEA. In particular, this will affect Mac users with the pre-release of JDK6. The solution is to target class files at the version of the IDEA JRE (i.e. 1.5 for Mac users). Thanks to J. G. Christopher. If you change the configuration options the real-time scan will not be updated until the file is either changed or reopened. We do not check if a property definition is required for a given file. Hence you can exit configuration without setting required properties. Given, however, that CheckStyle files can change without the plug-in being aware this is something we&#39;ll always have to live with to some degree. CheckStyle errors and warnings from the inspection are both shown at a single level, as IDEA will only allow one warning level for an inspection.</p>

 summary : <p>Aims and ObjectivesS5 (A Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System) is an entirely browser based slide show system built on web standards such as XHTML, CSS and JavaScript. S5 is rudimentary as a slide show system compared to other slide show systems such as Google Presentations. </p>

<p>This project will build on S5’s current limitations as we web-based slide show system. Also this project will explore ways in which S5 can make better use of the collaborative possibilities of Web 2.0, such as social-networking sites, wikis and blogs. This will involve documenting and evaluating the existing code base of several slide show systems and then gathering customer requirements for enhancements. </p>

<p>The key objective of the project will be to design and develop a web-based slide show system that incorporates a number of Web 2.0 technologies, and in essence compete against Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Presentations. An Extreme Programming (XP) approach will be adopted since this project will emphasise on customer involvement, teamwork and creating prototypes in quick succession. A team of developers will implement the proposed enhancements entirely on XHTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>

 title : The equaked Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Using data obtained via accelerometer readings on time-synchronized, collective E-puck robots, we propose a framework to detect in real-time the geographic epicenter of a radially-emitted shock wave. Combining techniques to obtain swarm synchronization, centralized communication and the parameters for   mathematical   multilateration,   our   research   provides foundational work for more advanced detection and localization of earthquake-like vibrations in swarm-intelligent systems. With an experimental setup consisting of three immobile E-puck robots,   our   methodology   has   shown   potential   to   provide accurate geographic localization of simple shock waves in a two-dimensional triangular arena. Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations   on   the   E-puck   robot   accelerometers,   actual experimental results were unattainable. This project highlights and contextualizes our implementation and outlines the crux of the problem in order to motivate future related research.</p>

 title : The haga Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HagaHaga is a presentation support tool for UNIX. If you have your presentation in PDF, you can use Haga to add auxiliary notes to individual slides and setup the intended length of your presentation. Then in most cases you can just press the fullscreen button and the presentation is running. Haga automagically detects if the computer has multiple screens attached. If it does, Haga will show its full user interface to you and the audience will see only the slides.  </p>

<p>It is of course work in progress. The current version is usable, but the user interface has many quirks that need to be sorted out.

 summary : <p>RationaleI work in research, and once in a while I need to give a talk or lecture. Normally I would use Apple&#39;s Keynote to show the presentation, but right now I have a Vista-based notebook. So my idea was to simply export the slides to a PDF using my Mac at home or create some slides with Beamer or Google Docs, and then show the presentation using my laptop and some ordinary PDF viewer. </p>

<p>After I tried that for the first time I instantly noticed something very useful is missing: The ability to have one screen that displays the content of the current slide, while the other one - the so called presenter screen - will show the presenter more content, e.g. notes, the next slide and a timer. Since I haven&#39;t found one Windows PDF viewer among the billions out there that supports this, PDF Prese</p>

 summary : <p>py2llvm is an another approach translating codes in Python syntax into LLVM IR for fast execution. </p>

<p>You can develop &amp; run your code in Python for rapid-prototyping phase. Once your code become in stable, your code is turned into native code by py2llvm and it runs extremely fast(as fast as C). </p>

<p>py2llvm enables easy development of your performance-oriented algorithm while its code runs as fast as C. </p>

<p>Since Python is a dynamic programming language, not all feature of Python can be mapped into LLVM IR by py2llvm. Only statically type-inferable and no object-oriented code fragment could be translated, but this is almost enough for performance-oriented programs for example numerical computation and graphics. </p>

<p>Here is a example translation by py2llvm. </p>

<p>SDL_Layer is a mechanism allowing the blitting of surfaces (sprites, animations, effects) on different planes/layers of the display. It is capable of doing scrolling with each layer having its own scrolling factor, to create depth effects. It is build on top of SDL (http://www.libsdl.org). </p>

<p>It is useful for example in a game, when one wants to have a background image, obstacles, and a foreground effect (clouds, fog, rain, etc.) </p>

<p>This library takes care of all the refresh problems when using a &quot;dirty rectangles&quot; method, reblitting notably the specific zones of each layer. You can also choose a &quot;whole refresh&quot; method using SDL_Flip. </p>

<p>Take a glance at the WiKi and see what it will be capable of. </p>

 summary : <p>Serveur web sémantique pour Last.fm</p>

<p>Nom  Contact   Maximilien Perrin    Camille Roux  Website  </p>

<p>ObjectifL’objectif de notre projet est d’exploiter des données extraites de Last.FM grâce à son API pour fournir une navigation directe et intuitive parmi les artistes et styles de musiques. L’utilisateur peut ainsi découvrir de nouveaux artistes et des morceaux de musique originaux suivant ses goûts musicaux, et obtenir des informations sur ce qu’il souhaite.  </p>

<p>Notre projet comporte deux parties fondamentales. La première partie consiste à développer un utilitaire destiné à récupérer un ensemble d’informations à partir des services web d’AudioScrobbler, afin de constituer une base sémantique représentative des musiques existantes. L’API mise à disposition ne permet pas de récupérer les  données de façon globale, mais seulement de façon ponctuelle : on peut par exemple récupérer à partir d’un artiste précis ses artistes proches, ses tags, ses albums... mais pas l’ensemble des artistes existants. Nous avons donc décidé d’utiliser un parcours en largeur sur le graphe des artistes proches afin de constituer une liste d’artistes, puis  pour chaque récupérer ses tags et ses albums. Cette méthode permet de constituer rapidement une base de  connaissances à partir d’un nom d’artiste. </p>

<p>La seconde partie de notre projet consiste en un site web permettant l’accès et la navigation parmi les données récupérées. Ce site, basé sur le moteur sémantique Sewese, devait respecter un certain nombre de contraintes que nous nous étions fixées. Tout d&#39;abord, nous souhaitions que le site soit ergonomique afin qu&#39;il puisse être  ludique pour l&#39;utilisateur. Nous tenions également à respecter certaines normes d&#39;accessibilité afin que le site puisse être utilisé par des déficients visuels ainsi que pour favoriser le référencement par les moteurs de recherche. </p>

<p>Scénarios d’utilisationComme nous l&#39;avons dit précédemment, nous avons décidé de faire en sorte que le site puisse offrir la possibilité à l&#39;utilisateur de réaliser un voyage dans la musique. Nous voulions qu&#39;il puisse facilement naviguer entre les styles de musique et les artistes. </p>

<p>Pour cela, nous avons décidé d&#39;afficher un nuage de tags en première page représentant les tags les plus utilisés dans notre base. Un clic sur un tag permet d&#39;afficher la liste des artistes qui correspondent le plus au tag en question, avec la photo du groupe si elle est disponible. Enfin, un clic sur un artiste affiche la page de l&#39;artiste lui- même qui est divisée en trois parties : la liste de ses albums, un nuage des tags correspondant à l&#39;artiste et aussi, les artistes qui ont un style proche de celui de l&#39;artiste. </p>

<p>Il est à noter qu&#39;il est possible de revenir sur le nuage de tags du départ à tout moment en cliquant sur le logo du site. </p>

<p>Enfin, nous avons ajouté un champ de recherche dans la bannière qui permet à l&#39;utilisateur de faire une recherche parmi les tags et les artistes, ce qui lui permet d&#39;accéder rapidement à l&#39;information s&#39;il le souhaite.</p>
 title : The sibyl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An Android music player.This project has been started within the context of a school project. We are four students from a French enginering school of Lyon called INSA. Our aim is to create an application for the Android platform, the Google operating system for mobile phones.  </p>

<p>The application is a music player, almost like Amarok, Winamp, iTunes or whatever audio player you can find. It has basics functionnalities such as play modes / smart playlists / library management. There is also a cover manager which can download missing covers. Sibyl uses Android SDK possibilities such as animations and touch mode. </p>

<p>Further developments will maybe consider the interaction with social networks (last.fm for example). </p>

<p>Do not hesitate to mail us to suggest features or to report bugs. You can find us on #sibyl-dev on Freenode.</p>

 title : The splitshow Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SplitShowA tool for the dual-head presentation of PDF slides on Mac OS X, most likely using a laptop and a projector. The project arose out of the need to correctly project slides created with LaTeX&#39;s BEAMER class. </p>

<p>Call for IconsAs you can see, SplitShow is still lacking a proper icon. Any contributions are more than welcome! We do have some ideas, we&#39;re just not very artistic. Email us for more information. And thanks in advance! </p>

<p>Dual-Head Full Screen Mode at Native ResolutionsTraditional PDF viewers require two displays to be in &quot;mirror&quot; mode in order to show the same image on both. The -- maybe not so obvious -- disadvantage of this is that the higher-resolution display is forced to used the resolution of the lower-resolution one. By keeping the two displays at their respective native resolutions in &quot;extended desktop&quot; mode, your slides will always look great on either side. </p>

<p>DonationsIf you think SplitShow saved your day, consider a donation to support our effort. Thanks in advance to all who donate! </p>

 summary : <p>GigaPan Stereo Imaging                                 </p>

<p>Project SummeryGigaPan is a system that consists of a robotic camera mount that uses a standard digital camera to capture a grid of pictures of a scene and custom software that stitches that grid together into a very high- resolution (gigapixel and up) panoramic image. Building off this technology, Stereo GigaPan (with backing from West Virginia University and NASA/Ames Intelligent Robotics Group) modifies the camera mount to support an additional consumer-grade digital camera. With two cameras the system now has the ability to ascertain depth information from a scene, which is used to create highly detailed 3D images and models. Combined with the addition of new remote control and robust power management systems, Stereo GigaPan greatly improves functionality while keeping costs within the budget of any aspiring photographer. </p>
