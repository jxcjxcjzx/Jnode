 summary : <p>PyMinuit2Minuit2 numerical function minimization in Python </p>

<p>MinuitMinuit has been the standard package for minimizing general N-dimensional functions in high-energy physics since its introduction in 1972.  It features a robust set of algorithms for optimizing the search, correcting mistakes, and measuring non-linear error bounds.  It is the minimization engine used behind-the-scenes in most high-energy physics curve fitting applications. </p>

<p>Python interfacePyMinuit2 is an extension module for Python that passes low-level Minuit functionality to Python functions.  Interaction and data exploration is more user-friendly, in the sense that the user is protected from segmentation faults and index errors, parameters are referenced by their names, even in correlation matrices, and Python exceptions can be passed from the objective function during the minimization process.  This extension module also makes it easier to calculate Minos errors and contour curves at an arbitrary number of sigmas from the minimum, and features a new N-dimensional scanning utility. </p>

<p>PyMinuit versus PyMinuit2There are two versions of Minuit, both of which are C++ re-writes of the original Fortran Minuit.  The first of these, &quot;SEAL-Minuit&quot;, is an independent software package that has all the functionality of the original Minuit, but is no longer maintained.  The second, &quot;Minuit2&quot;, is a part of the ROOT package and is actively being developed.  There are correspondingly two versions of PyMinuit, which appeal to different users: </p>

<p>PyMinuit: contains SEAL-Minuit 1.7.9 and the Python interface to it; installs in one step.  Use this if you don&#39;t have ROOT (or don&#39;t know what it is) and you just want to find the minimum of functions. PyMinuit2  (this package): only contains an interface to Minuit2 and must be linked to an existing ROOT distribution.  Use this if you want to use the algorithms contained in a specific ROOT version. PyMinuit and PyMinuit2 present the same interface to the Python user, so the documentation on the PyMinuit site applies to PyMinuit2.  See Minuit2Features for extra features specific to PyMinuit2. </p>

<p>Versions and system requirementsPyMinuit2 requires Python 2.4 or later and version of ROOT with Minuit2.  It has only been tested on Linux. </p>

<p>In principle, it should compile and run on Mac OS X, and it might work on Windows.  If you get PyMinuit2 working on one of these systems, please send me a instructions, so that I can post them for the benefit of other users.</p>

<p>Schedule?: </p>

<p>By Nov 30 All inital planning done. (Joey learn java gui) By Dec 14 Program features 100%. By Dec 21 All text/lesson data done, bugs fixed. CHECK PLANNING. I HAVE WRITTEN UP A PRELIMINARY CLASS PROPOSAL. ADD COMMENTS. ~a.f </p>

<p>Honestly, we&#39;ll talk about in school. Chillax for now. You too, Edward :-) </p>

<p>Dude, the program is being released 12/21/07 regardless of when we finish. Also, Joey and Daniel are busy getting fat off of turkey today, and I&#39;ve got a playlistpanel to finish for Konfetka. ~af </p>

<p>From purnimy&#39;s inspiration, I&#39;ve separated the clock class from its hand, the new Arrow class, and created a preliminary Detector class. I&#39;ve also uploaded a really basic tester to show how I was thinking of using them. ~efuzzy </p>

<p>Totally revamped everything by adding a Path and PathIterator class. PathIterator now keeps track of the clocks location. It keeps constant speed, and even turns corners :-). Make sure you take a look so you can: a)worship my code b)check for bugs and suggestions. ~efuzzy </p>

 summary : <p>It is a simple framework that demonstrate the power of Q-Learning. Using Q-Learning, the robot can automatically adapt the structure of itself (E.g. Three legs, big head, long foot, snake shape) and depending on itself to learn to achieve certain goal (E.g. Walking, Rolling ... ). In order to use the framework, user only have to do two things </p>

<p>1) Create robot structure that he/she likes (By putting those body block together and use joint or actuator to connect them) </p>

<p>2) Specify a very simple function that return higher value if robot is doing what you like and lower value doing naughty things you don&#39;t like </p>

<p>After some time of training by itself, WALA!!, the robot starts to do things that you wanted him to do. But notice, you  don&#39;t even have tell it how to do it, it learns all by itself. </p>

<p>Enjoy having fun with this framework.  :) </p>

<br/>QuInfoTP: Quantum Information Theory &amp; Theoretical PhysicsMy name is Patrick Hoo, with the Chinese name Gengfeng Hu (Chinese: 胡更峰; pinyin: hú gēng fēng; Nickname: Patrick or Pat). I was born in Meixian, Guangdong province, the People&#39;s Republic of China on Jan. 26th, 1986. I think I was born to a Taoist. Actually I&#39;m a cynical boy, physics enthusiast, TeXnician, Google fan, and absolutely Debian GNU/Linux lover. </p>

<p>During The World Year of Physics 2005, I knew I should take theoretical physics as my lifework. </p>

<p>I must thank three people for their helping me on Physics during my college life[Sept.2004~Aug.2008]: </p>

<p>First, I will thank Prof. Luo, without her help, I could not had my dreaming job;  Second, I wanna thank Prof. Chen, he helped me with my knowledge of the basic theoretical things of quantum computation and quantum information; And last, I must thank Prof. Hong, he is a kind-hearted man and he furnished me an office, I&#39;m a member of Centre for THz Research[Jan.2007~Aug.2008], which was foundedSept.2006 by Prof. Hong in my college (China Institute of Metrology, abbr. CIM), it is mainly about quantum entanglement, quantum measurement, quantum control, etc.  As the saying goes, the secret of success is constancy of purpose. I will win through in the end. </p>

<br/>emacs-snapshot.  You&#39;re using i386 which is a supported

 summary : <p>features | what you can expect of our mod 
<br/>finally our joined project has made the step from its origins on a dreary board to a neat web presentation. On these pages you will now find some stuff about our mod-in-planning. All in all we follow two main objectives with the development of our mod, which we are always keeping a close eye on: </p>

<p>&gt; We want to create one of the most intense and atmospheric game experiences, like you have originally expected it from Doom! In order to do that we will further expand the strong points of the game and reasonably add to them, among others the display of light and shadows - as well as get rid of weak points like the predictable monotony. Of course otherwise we are trying to get some distance to the original game and create an independent game environment </p>

<p>&gt; We are going to play some real pranks on you and toy with your fears impressively by means of enemies and ambience. It is supposed to turn into the most appalling and sneaky game experience for you, which will thoroughly shock you time and again in situations where you expect it the least. Together with a complex story full of intrigues it is going to form a hellish symbiosis. </p>

<p>all in all you may look forward to the following features. Here now everything listed to the point and in detail: </p>

<p>&gt; General Improvements </p>

<p>&quot;Ascent of blood and steel&quot; offers improved graphic with optional adjustable graphic effects like: Lens Flare or Bloom effects, exclusive Parallax mapping as well as nice water- and weather effects. A newly designed hud, adjusted to the features of &quot;Ascent of blood and steel&quot;, is going to make navigation easier for you and provide you with the necessary data. In the future, this is going to be projected directly on the iris of a person and manipulated by stimulation of the visual nerves. Even your PDA and all relevant facts are going to be projected on your iris like this. &gt; Story </p>

<p>Look forward to a more intense and much more complex story like that of Doom³. With lots of surprising twists, extreme entanglements and unpredictable intrigues around the year 2125 and the infamous extraterrestrial mining organization PTMI. You are going to meet various more or less story-relevant NPCs with useful hints, effective support or dark and insidious intents. Who you can trust and who is part of the murderous futuristic conspiration you have to find out by yourself. Well scripted cinematics are going to keep you in the loop and visually impressively advance the complex story, likewise radio transmissions and multimedia messages. &gt; Maps </p>

<p>Instead of just playing on Mars, &quot;Ascent of blood and steel&quot; introduces many unique locations situated all over the celestial bodies of our entire solar system. Each with different look, level design, player behavior and interactivity with the environment - for less visual monotony and more in-game variety than in the original Doom³. Be it gigantic meteorites, abandoned underwater stations or oppressive dark bunker shafts - an authentic game world should emerge. Instead of dull, dreary monster carnage a whole set of innovative mission objectives and complex story-relevant tasks is waiting for you. There are clearly more cave- and outside areas, dark grottos, snow covered crater landscapes, hot lava caverns... some terrains are so huge, that the can only be passed by vehicles and in their vast extent effectfully alternate with oppressive and dark inside areas. The locations are visually perfected by atmospheric light and shadow games, fog and smoke effects. Various weather influences, like rainfall or nightfalls guarantee a convincing real dark atmosphere &gt; Enemies </p>

<p>Less but all the more insidiously placed enemies instead of clumsily streaming monster masses are going to introduce you to real fear and slyly attack you when you expect it the least. There won&#39;t be much cheap cannon fodder, but instead even more surprising shock moments. You will see yourself confronted with lots of new enemy models, especially created fort he story, with their very own scripts and animations. For example the well known Blauhoernchen, or the Wasteman. Of course together with old acquaintances from Doom³ - but with redesigned versions of looks and behavior. Dynamic evolution over the course of the game is going to make your enemies flexibly evolve in strategies, strength, looks as well as intelligence. So you are going to encounter many creatures with various versions of behavior. An improved and partially adaptive AI provides them with additional new attack and defense tactics, adjusted to your moves and weaponry. Even team arrangement in the enemy lines, intelligent group tactics and coordinated attacks are planned. You might as well expect innovative offensive techniques from your adversaries, which by far exceed the doom-typical fireball throwing. They will even be able to generate dynamic level- and light changes and use the environment to their advantage. Others collectively use the locally installed camera systems to spot you. &gt; Objects </p>

<p>Look forward to own PTMI spaceships which serve as a means of transport between the planets! On board of those the story will advance further, you will be able to converse with NPCs, to gather important data on your next mission and to arm yourself with ammo and weapons. Those weapons were actually all designed as mining tools for the mines of the PTMI. Some few of them will remind you slightly of the typical Ego-Shooter arsenal in function and design, but for the most part they will come with a completely innovative handling. Most of them are designed as short range weapons for closer contact with the dark creatures for the benefit of the atmosphere. There will be a dynamic weapon arsenal. You won&#39;t take all weapons with you at one time, but be allowed to chose a few useful and fitting ones for every upcoming mission to adequately equip yourself. Their management and storage is planned in an inventory system like we know it from role play games. More important items and story integrated goodies, like maybe visors and radar will help you in your struggle to survive. You will have your very own sentry bot at your side as a faithful companion and you will be able to use it at certain points and control it by PDA to master some impassable paths. Also planned is a little motor pool of controllable vehicles, which will help you cover long distances. For example a futuristic magnetic hover forklifter, various small railcars and drivable buggies which you may use to jet over spacious planet surfaces.</p>

 summary : <p>Some of you may have noticed a youtube button appearing and disappearing on the site. I tried to enable users to upload videos through geocast directly into their youtube accounts. I failed miserably, that thing just refuses to work. I am gonna abandon youtube for a little and focus on tighter integration with icanhascheezburger. </p>

<p>Open ID is finally here. Now you can sign into Geocast using your Gmail/Google account, just click the google icon on the front page and follow the directions. </p>

<p>Awesome news everyone! The first semi-functional GWT client is ready!!! IE6 users will be pleased to find their browser is now supported. Everything should look better and work faster then before. Ability to login with your Gmail account and upload videos to your youtube account via geocast are coming soon! </p>

<p>The move to GWT has begun! So far login, registration, and shareable upload pages have been updated to us it, the main shareable viewer is up next. Of course you are probably wondering when the Geocast G1 client will be coming out, not any time soon unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the time to move the client to the 1.0 version of the android API, or the money to buy the device. </p>

<p>The geocast web client now permits registered users to upload their own shareables, go here to register, and an upload link will pop up after you log in. </p>

<p>The latest Geocast build provides a semi functional way of uploading shareables - you can create text, url, youtube url or photo shareables and submit them. They become a part of the selected sequence(or no sequence if you have not downloaded and selected one). It is best to reset the dao after uploading shareables. You can go to the geocast test server to view your uploaded shareables </p>

<p>     </p>

<p>Due to summer heat, midwestern flooding, the tomato debacle and general lack of motivation the schedule had to be reworked to be more realistic: Ability to upload shareables for review and publication - July 08 Geocast J2ME client work start - August 08 User driven shareable review feature - September 08 Windows Mobile Geocast client - Off the menu for now </p>

<p>Well folks, we didn&#39;t win the ADC. That is, of course, a bit of a downer, but the world is gonna have to try a lot harder than that if it wants to get rid of us proper! Here is a tentative schedule of the things to come: </p>

<p>Ability to upload shareables for review and publication in Android - June 08 Ability to upload shareables for review and publication on the web - June 08 Geocast J2ME client work start - June 08 User driven shareable review feature in Android - August 08 User driven shareable review feature on the web - August 08 First draft Geocast J2ME client release - October 08 Windows Mobile Geocast client work start - October 08 And so on, and so forth...    The latest Geocast build fixes a number of minor issues that were in the version submitted to the ADC, there are also some new features. Improvements:  When a filter string is entered on the geocast options tab the first sequence returned from the shareable source will contain the closest shareables who&#39;s descriptions match that string Most user settings are now persisted, like the last tab viewed, the selected shareable source, user location, etc.. Ability to download sequences from the map added Ability to search for sequences by name added Users are now able to initiate downloading of new shareables while browsing the map Location changes now immediately show up on the map. Resetting the shareable source no longer resets user&#39;s current location to Mountain View Start up time is shorter The &quot;Get Next Sequence&quot; button has been relocated to the top of the ShareableListView. Now it does not scroll off the screen if you download too many sequences. All screen sizes available in the emulator are now supported </p>

<p>Geocast enables users to see files posted by others based on location and proximity. All data that goes up on http://android-geocast.com is reviewed. The review system currently consists of Geocast project members looking at any data that goes up on the server. A user driven content rating system will be made available sometime in august 08. </p>

<p>Currently you are able to view text,image and url files, video and audio will be added soon(after the April 14th submission though). Read the full readme for more details and whats already there and whats not. </p>

<p>Files are retrieved by category(or sequence) to which they belong. You can also type in a filter string in the geocast options tab. Only sequences who&#39;s long or short descriptions match the filter will be retrieved.  </p>

<p>Geocast needs android m5-rc15 in order to function properly. </p>

 title : The agave-web-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Agave is a Java 1.5+ library that allows you to cleanly expose a domain model through a Web interface. Simply put, it serves as the C in the MVC approach to interface programming. It is compact with very little conceptual overhead, yet powerful enough to account for evolution in the approache to Web programming on the Servlet API and the lack of stateful transactions across requests over the HTTP protocol. It provides this functionality without a large down payment because Agave is very easy to learn if you are familiar with Web programming, and in many cases can provide the shortest path between a concept and its actualization.  </p>

 title : The drupal-stm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Update: I&#39;ve abandoned support of this project in favour of using drush. Check it out. You&#39;ll love it </p>

<p>I sometimes use Drupal for my web development work. </p>

<p>As part of my development workflow, I pull any Drupal Core and Contributed source from Drupal CVS. I call the resulting collection of code my local Drupal source tree and use make in my various Drupal projects to build in the Core and Contrib that I need from this tree. This way I can keep  everything in one place, control updates, and use SVN for my Drupal projects without effecting the CVS control of the source tree. </p>

<p>dstm is a simple bash script I created some time ago to manage this Drupal source tree. dstm can update the entire tree using one command. I can keep a dstm profile for any version dependencies of Contrib projects within specific Drupal branches (versions) and dstm will find the latest version of a module without having to look up the CVS Tag that controls module versioning. dstm also generates a sample Makefile for new Drupal projects. </p>

<p>Due to interest from others who wanted to use dstm in their own workflow, I decided to clean up the script and release it. Please use it if you think it useful.  </p>

<p>Note: I am aware of the drush project. At the time I used it, drush was really great but dtsm solved a few different problem for me. However, you should also check it out.  </p>

<p>More documentation to come. </p>

 title : The e-d-e Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EDE is a web development environment for servers running etelos EAS.</p>

<p>100% Secure Communication
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EDE 4 operates under SSL only. All communication with the server is run through the SSL layer.</p>

<p>Publishing Queue
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Two new tabs are added to give you full access to the Publisher&#39;s history and current status.</p>

<p>Drag&#39;n Drop EASE Code
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now you can drag a binder into the text editor and you&#39;ll get the choice to automatically generate a List Engine, Form Engine, or just drop a portable tag for the binder.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This greatly increases the speed of app development by saving you the trouble of creating these engines by hand.</p>

<p>Variable Data Types
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Support for specifying the variable data type has been added. For most applications, the default unlimited data type is fine. With EDE 4 however, you can squeeze every bit of performance out of your EAS database by controlling the variable data types at your own discretion.</p>

<p>Clean Up Features
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Support to empty the contact trash has been added. Also, mass deletion of binder instances is much easier, just a right click away.</p>

<p>Instance Update
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No more module refreshing to get the current name of the issue you are editing. See issue names get updated right as you change them.</p>

<p>ESPX File Support
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ESPX Files are now first class citizens. That means you have the same ability to use headers and footers in a folder as in the Web module. Just add files named header.espx and footer.espx to a folder.</p>

<p>Designated Preview Contact
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EDE 4 now remembers the designated contact for previews.</p>

All elements are modular, the base package being slimmed down to bare basics. Install and remove modules at will with point and click functionality. </p>

<p>For example, say that today you wish to establish a website which is purely eCommerce - download flosee, install the eCommerce module and setup your website design, then launch your site. 6 months down the line you may wish to integrate a forum, at which point you install the forum module. This seemlessly integrates with your eCommerce application and takes on the same design layout - 1 click and your forum is live, no need to redesign your template or integrate individual packages. The same applies to all modules which are freely interchangeable at will. </p>

<p>flosee is currently in early development, please feel free to get in touch to register your interest or intent to join the project. At this stage flosee is being developed solely by logon.info</p>

 summary : <p>The Web Alignment Group describes and designs cross-platform technologies that pertain to web application development and deployment.  </p>

<p>Within the development community, there has been a spontaneous trend toward cross-pollination between the various web application platforms. Often, the cross-pollination has been in the form of porting products from one platform to another. It is already possible to define complete application stacks for Java and .NET using the same product at each layer (see Anvil).  </p>

<p>The Web Alignment Group seeks to support and enhance cross-pollination by creating and maintaining specifications for cross-platform web application technologies, along with reference implementations for various platforms, when possible.  </p>

<p>The group is managed using Apache-style meritocractic policies. Any individual who is already a &quot;committer&quot; to an existing web application framework is welcome to join us as a member. Other individuals who make sustained and welcome contributions to the project will also be invited to join. (Memberships are available to individual persons only. Corporate entities may not be members.) All members are required to file a Contributors License Agreement with the group before write-access can be granted.  </p>

<p>Note that the focus of the group is not on general web technologies, but on web application technologies.</p>

 title : The webpyte Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Webpyte is a new megaframework for web development, inspired by TurboGears, and based on: </p>

<p>Python 2.6 (extremely high level programming language) CherryPy 3.1.2 (vastly superior to the one used in TurboGears 1.x) SQLAlchemy (flexible ORM for your database needs) Routes (versatile URL dispatching) Genshi (templating language) Paste (evalexception shows exceptions and lets you interact) TurboMail 3.0.2 (sends out e-mails) simplejson 2.0.5 jQuery 1.3.2 (javascript library) WYMeditor 0.5rc1 (an HTML editor used in the content package) Webpyte also contains FormettoFramework, a new Python/Javascript framework which makes declaring web forms very easy. </p>

<p>Why use Webpyte?Only 2/3 as much RAM. TurboGears and Pylons typically use 25 MB RAM for a Hello World and 30 MB for a small website. Webpyte only uses 15 MB and 20 MB respectively. Much of this is due to the CherryPy upgrade. Do you know how much RAM you are using in your sites? Lightweight. Webpyte integrates those projects in such a way that, if you aren&#39;t going to use one of them, it is not even going to be imported. For instance, if you prefer Mako to Genshi, just don&#39;t import the wp_genshi module. That is all. All the advantages of CherryPy 3.1. Virtual hosts: You can serve more than one application from the same process. Webpyte already has &quot;Auth&quot;, a small, nice form authentication and authorization framework. It is easily extensible. Existing modules for pages, blogs, contact forms, image upload and management, product catalogues and downloading a backup of the database: WebpytePackages. During development, exceptions are shown by Ian Bicking&#39;s evalexception: you can see the source code, the variables, and interact in a Python interpreter! (Or just have the normal CherryPy 3 behaviour.) In production, the exception messages are hidden, but sent to you via e-mail (if you want it). Webpyte provides a defaultdict that is passed to all templates, containing variables and functions that are used very often. Webpyte provides transactions using SQLAlchemy. And you can use more than one database. It works. See SitesPoweredByWebpyte. Python 2.6. Other frameworks support ancient Python versions. We are new, so we demand 2.6 which is full of cool features. Webpyte disadvantagesCurrently, documentation is mostly in the code itself. Very small community. Internationalization (i18n) is coming soon. Where is the code?See InstallingWebpyte. </p>

<p>An older version, BasedOnTurboGears, is available as: svn checkout http://webpyte.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.1-based-on-TG1 webpyte0.1 </p>

 summary : <p>A very simple blog with regular posts and nested pages. Using Zend Framework.  </p>

<p>Main intention of project is to sculpture a blog-system to my own personal needs. Since I could not find any systems easy enough and yet with the functionality I required I decided to try write my own. Thus this is probably done before, someone probably did it better than this project will and it has a great chance of death. Never the less, it is fun to try - and it is a great way of testing Google&#39;s code hosting service! (Thanks Googool!:) </p>

<p>The project will embrace loose coupling with possible trade-offs regarding performance.  </p>

<p>Technically, the project will be a Zend Framework Module using COTS from Zend Framework. </p>

 title : The ccds Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mandarin CCDS is a PHP5/MySql5 based CMS including Smarty Template Engine, Xajax and jQuery with multi language support, in place editing and much more useful features. </p>

<p>Mandarin CCDS uses a different approach of storing and returning contents than most other content management systems. The backend stores all objects (contents) in a tree structure. All objects belong to a certain class and each class consists of basic properties and (optional) content fields (mysql tables) and/or parameters. The entire frontend is completely customizable using Smarty templates. There are no predefined column layouts and/or content areas. Mandarin CCDS adds its own functions to the template engine for querying all kinda objects from the database. If you are already familiar with smarty and sick of writing your own custom backends, you will like it! </p>

<p>It&#39;s bright, shiny, fast and absolutely lovely :) </p>

<p>InstallationCopy all files and folders to your webroot. The trunk contains the SQL scheme called ccds3.sql. Create the database and afterwards change the paths and mysql information in the configuration file located in /ccds_config/config.inc.php. When using apache make sure the .htaccess file is located in your docroot. You can also copy the rewrite rules into your vhost configuration. </p>

<p>Afterwards you can login at: http://yourdomain.com/ccds/ </p>

<p>The default login is admin:administrator. Don&#39;t forget to change your login after successful installation. </p>

<p>Updates notes:2009-09-22This update contains a lot of improvements and bugfixes. All core functions &amp; modules are included as well as the Mysql database scheme.  </p>

<p>The current version is not yet fully translated. Most messages and labels are still german, but will be translated soon. </p>

<p>The caching has been improved and support for memcached is fully integrated. The mysql queries for retrieving contents have been improved and the number of necessary queries to deliver webpages has been reduced. The imagine resize engine on smarty templates now supports: </p>

 title : The cirrus-x Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cirrus-x (Cix) is an OpenSource toolkit for building cloud based internet components and solutions. Components or solutions built using it can run in the cloud, on individual internet based servers or on servers behind organisational firewalls. In fact these components can run across several layers in a concurrent and distributed fashion if so desired. </p>

<p>Cirrus-x can be used to build simple components or complex cloud based information systems. It includes built in redundancy and data replication with local or distributed memory caching. </p>

<p>The implementation provides REST based data models and natively supports JSON along with basic feeds for all items stored in the repository. </p>

<p>Further Cirrus-x obviates the need for the complex administration associated with replicated relational databases by including a fast replicated and distributed storage system.</p>
 summary : <p>Colored Trails </p>

<p>Settings in which many people and many computer systems work together, despite being distributed both geographically and in time, are increasingly the norm. Examples of group activities in which computer systems participate, whether as autonomous agents or as proxies for individual people, include online auctions, hospital care-delivery systems, emergency response systems, military systems, and systems administration groups. These increasingly prevalent, heterogeneous group activities of computer systems and people-- whether competitive, cooperative, or collaborative--frequently require decision-making on the part of autonomous-agent systems or the support of decision-making by people. </p>

<p>A wide variety of issues arise in the decision making that accompanies task-oriented group activities. How do groups decide who should perform which tasks in service of which goals? How are coalitions formed? How do agents coordinate their behavior? How do agents select an appropriate recipe for achieving a goal from among the set that might be applicable? How are tasks allocated among agents capable of performing them? How do agents reconcile their current intentions to perform actions in service of group goals with new opportunities that arise? How do agents avoid conflicts in their plans for achieving goals? How does altruistic or cooperative behavior arise in individual behaviors? What incentives can be provided to encourage cooperation, helpfulness, or other group-benefiting behaviors when agents are designed independently or serve different organizations? </p>

<p>Professors Barbara Grosz and Sarit Kraus developed the game Colored Trails (CT) as a testbed for investigating the decision-making that arises in task settings, where the key interactions are among goals (individual and group), tasks required to accomplish those goals, and resources needed to perform the tasks. CT allows the modeling of all of these phenomena and exploration of their causes and ramifications. It provides the basis for development of a testbed that supports investigations of human decision-making and comparisons among computational strategies is needed, one that would enable human decision-making to be studied both in groups comprising only people and in heterogeneous groups of people and computer system and for computational strategies to be studied both in settings where computational agents interact only with other such agents and in heterogeneous settings.   CT is parameterized in ways that allow for increasing complexity along a number of different dimensions that influence the performance of different approaches to decision making. It allows for specification of different reward structures, enabling examination of such trade-offs as the importance of the performance of others or the group as a whole to the outcome of an individual and the cost-benefit tradeoffs of collaboration-supporting actions. The game parameters may be set to vary environmental features such as task complexity, availability of and access to task-related information, and dependencies between agents. Although several testbeds and competitions have been developed to test strategies for automated agents operating in multi-agent settings, CT is the first testbed to be designed to investigate decision-making in heterogeneous groups of people and computer systems. It is thus novel in addressing the need to understand how computer agents should behave when they are participants in group activities that include people.   </p>

<p>Structure of the gameColored Trails (CT) is played by two or more players on a rectangular board of colored squares. The rules are simple: Each player is given a starting position, a goal position on the board, and a set of chips in colors taken from the same palette as the squares. Players may advance toward their goals by moving to an adjacent board square. Such a move is allowed only if the player has a chip of the same color as the square, and the player must turn in the chip to carry out the move. Players may negotiate with their peers to exchange chips. Communication is controlled; players used a fixed but expressive messaging protocol. </p>

<p>The scoring function, which determines the payoff to the individual players, is a parameter of CT game instances and may depend on a variety of factors. At its simplest, it may consist of a weighted sum of such components as: whether the individual reached the goal, the final distance of the agent from the goal, the final number of chips the agent held. The scoring function may be varied to reflect different possible social policies and utility trade-offs, establishing a context in which to investigate the effects of different decision-making mechanisms. </p>

<p>For example, by varying the relative weights of individual and group good in the scoring function we can make collaborative behavior may become more or less beneficial. Despite the simplicity of the rules, play of CT is able to model a broad range of aspects of task situations in which a group of agents perform actions; it allows for scenarios in which agents act as individuals or in teams or both. Traversing a path through the board corresponds to performing a complex task the constituents of which are the individual tasks represented by each square. Different colors represent different tasks. The existence of multiple paths to a goal corresponds to the availability of different &quot;recipes&quot; or methods for achieving goals. The possession of a chip of a particular color corresponds to having the skills and resources needed for a task, and being able to deploy them at the appropriate time. Not all players get chips of all colors much as agents have different capabilities, availability, and resources. The exchange of chips corresponds to agents producing the intended effects of actions for each other; in different domain settings an exchange could be taken to correspond to agents providing resources to each other, doing tasks for them, or enabling them in some other way to do tasks they otherwise could not do. The game environment may be set to model different knowledge conditions as well. For example, varying the amount of the board an agent can &quot;see&quot; corresponds to varying information about task constituents or resource requirements, whereas varying the information players have about each other&#39;s chips corresponds to varying information agents have about the capabilities of others. Various requirements on player objectives, goal squares, and paths correspond to different types of group activities and collaborative tasks. To distinguish cooperative settings from those in which agents act independently, the scoring function may have a significant factor in which an agent&#39;s reward depends on others&#39; performance.</p>

 title : The dwprj Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The aim of dataweb project is to create a rapid development tool for applications oriented to the manipulations of database. The applications created with this tool are immediately usable in net. The main features of dataweb are: </p>

<p>Client/Server architectureDataweb project is composed from a server side that manages mainly the access to the database and from a client side that manages mainly the user interface. The two parts communicate with each other through tcp-ip protocol with the possibility to encrypt the communication </p>

<p>Multi platformThe client and the server, can work on all operating systems compatible with java runtime: </p>

<p>Apple Linux Solaris Windows Multi databaseDataweb project thanks to a interface implementation can support more database. Now it can use the following database engine: </p>

<p>HSQLDB PostgresSQL Multi userDataweb project has a multiuser management having the following characteristics: </p>

<p>Set permissions on several the objects (Tables, Views,Forms, Reports, etc..). Logging of user operations. Manage records competition. Multi languageDataweb project manages the multilanguage support because it gives to the user the possibility of being able to set up, through his profile, the language with which operating on several the objects (Tables, Views, Forms, Reports, etc..). if the translation for the chosen language is not present then it comes used the default language. </p>

<p>Client is small dimension and self-installer and self-updaterThe client is of small dimensions (around 900 KB), it&#39;s installation happens downloading one file by browser that, once executed, it also provides the verification and possible installation of Java runtime. The client update happens automatically when it connects it&#39;s to the server. To the connection in fact it comes made a comparison between the two versions (of the Client and of the Server), if they are different the system provides automatically to download and installation of the correct version. </p>

<p>Management of the applications to packagesDataweb project groups all the objects (Tables, Views, Forms, Reports, etc..), used by a specific application, in an only package, consequently there will be so many packages as the applications. </p>

<p>Development, administration and use of the packages from remoteInstalling the client it is possible to enter to an any server remote or local specifying the name or the ip. Subsequently, having the necessary permissions, it&#39;s possible to develop packages ( to create Tables, Views, Forms, Reports, etc..) ,to administer the server (users, services..etc) or to use the application created. </p>

<p>Management of the packages&#39; versionWith Dataweb project it is possible to update software packages, already installed to the customers, automatically. When making modifications on existing packages, Dataweb creates update script with the relative version automatically. </p>

<p>Management of the packages&#39; installation and updateDataweb project creates installation/update packages with a procedure that writes necessary objects for the functioning software in a file. Subsequently to install this file it is necessary to be connected to server in administrator modality and to select the installation procedure that install the package or, if it already exists, update it. </p>

<p>Integration of external modulesDataweb project is an applications oriented to the manipulations of database, but thanks to the possibility to add external modules (jar), practically it allows to build any application. </p>

<p>Creation and use of webserviceThe webservice is a good tool to make to communicate trasparently between them software. With Dataweb it is possible to create some functions that can be recalled from any other programming language that support the SOAP protocoll (.net, php, java, etc..) . It&#39;s olso possible to recall from dataweb the webservices created from other applications.</p>

 title : The firecell Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionFireCell is a game where a player becomes a hacker in a virtual world that has a global network resembling the current internet. The object of the game is to start as a &#39;newbie&#39; hacker-wannabe, and progress through the game by learning, hacking, and gaining experience from each such event. </p>

<p>The game will be a network based game, with servers hosted somewhere on the internet. Players will be able to communicate  with each other, compete against each other, and either co-operate on hacking missions, or interfere with other player&#39;s hacking  attempts. Players may also be able to hack other players and &#39;steal&#39; information, programs and other assets (maybe money?). </p>

<p>The game will be presented in an 3D rendered environment (possibly even 2D), although it should not be required to compete with  titles such as Age of Conan, Guildwars, World of Warcraft etc with regards to graphical intensity or environments. At the heart of  FireCell is the concept that it is an intelligent game for players that enjoy mental and strategic challenges, against the &#39;environment&#39;  as well as against other players. </p>

<p>Also, have started implementing player &#39;actions&#39; such as port scanning which is working fine against other players and in-game company entities. </p>

<p>2009-05-06 </p>

<p>The Visual Studio solution and projects have been moved to Visual Studio 2008. I will be working on creating a working Code::Blocks workspace and build now. </p>

<p>First binary release posted! </p>

<p>I have released a package of Windows binaries for anyone interested in seeing what I&#39;ve been up to. There is not much functionality in terms of gameplay yet, but this should be enough to give an overview of the direction that I&#39;m heading in. </p>

<p>Head on over to http://code.google.com/p/firecell/downloads/list and download the binary :) </p>

<p>Team Status: Accepting applications </p>

<p>Its time to get some experienced people on board. I&#39;m looking for people who enjoy programming, who don&#39;t mind being moderated by a project owner, and most importantly, like the concept of the the project. </p>

<p>The skills needed at the moment are: </p>

<p>C++ developer (with distributed network development experience) C++ developer (with irrLicht/GUI development experience) Sound designer Graphic designer with experience in working on GUI projects. Development Status: Alpha/Implementation </p>

<p>2009-02-24 </p>

<p>An irrLicht based client is now in development. The Game world&#39;s event system in now operational The mission engine is working with basic missions Missions are now definable in the database The Forum engine is up and running (with client support) The FileSystem published events based on certain operations occurring Work has started on new character creation A lot of refactoring and memory leak fixing has taken place Alpha client and server binaries will soon be available for download. 2008-12-08 </p>

<p>Have completed most of the work on the FileSystem object. I have a feeling that I&#39;m going to need to introduce a mediator pattern when it comes to remote/local handling of file systems. Will do that after Forums. Started work on the forum&#39;ing portion of the game. The forum will literally act the same as a standard web based forum, with some added extras (wait and see :)) </p>

<p>I am getting to the point where I will be looking for some help in development. If you have found this project, and think that its something you would like to get involved with, please drop me a line. Potential positions are: 1 c++ dev (preferably with 3d cross platform experience), a graphic artist and a game content designer. </p>

<p>2008-11-28 </p>

<p>Have started work on the filesystems on online systems in the game, as well as the traversal of the file systems. Initial prototype code is in and allows traversal of a player&#39;s local filesystem. Next step will be to connect to a &#39;remote&#39; host and traverse that filesystem. fter the file system is complete, a refactor will probably happen on the code, and then onto the online resources like forums, news and banks. 2008-11-23 </p>

<p>Authentication Service is done for now. Lots of work is going into designing the World Service. Currently working on loading the world data and providing efficient access to it, as well as designing the mechanisms for missions to be received (and completed) as well as player interaction with NPCs and game based &#39;targets&#39;. </p>

<p>2008-11-03 </p>

<p>Authentication service is almost complete. Work has started on designing the world event system (emiting events as well as consuming them by the correct recipients). Completed a refactor and abstraction on base service logic objects, making the development of new service logic layers much simpler. </p>

<p>Work is continuing on the console client to test various new functionality in the services. I would be really interested to know if someone has written a test bench for multi-process solutions such as this one. </p>

<p>Work is also commencing on the &#39;Administration frontend&#39; which is a php based web application and will provide access to the entire game&#39;s data. The administrator will not only allow you to admin the players of the system, but also add new items, quests, npcs etc.</p>

<p>Create your Free Blog at - http://iwebslog.com/ Demo - http://iwebslog.com/sign-up/ </p>

<p>Iwebs is a web-publishing platform (based on world&#39;s best open source blogging software) with a keen focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability. Iwebs is free for anyone who wish to express his/her thoughts online. </p>

<p>Follow the three easy steps below to start blogging in minutes. Or, for the ultimate in ease of use, get a free blog on iwebs. </p>

<p>Features The following is a list of some of the features that come standard with iwebs, however there are literally hundreds of plugins (on WordPress Site that can also be used with iwebs) that extend what iwebs does, so the actual functionality is nearly limitless. You are also free to do whatever you like with the iwebs code, extend it or modify in any way or use it for commercial projects without any licensing fees. That is the beauty of free software, free meaning not only price but also the freedom to have complete control over it. </p>

<p>Key Features Full standards compliance — We have gone to great lengths to make sure every bit of iwebs generated code is in full compliance with the standards of the W3C. This is important not only for interoperability with today&#39;s browser but also for forward compatibility with the tools of the next generation. Your web site is a beautiful thing, and you should demand nothing less. </p>

<p>No rebuilding — Changes you make to your templates or entries are reflected immediately on your site, with no need for regenerating static pages. </p>

<p>Iwebs Pages — Pages allow you to manage non-blog content easily, so for example you could have a static &quot;About&quot; page that you manage through iwebs. For an idea of how powerful this is, the entire http://investorline.co.in site could be run off WordPress alone. </p>

<p>Iwebs Links -- Links allows you to create, maintain, and update any number of blogrolls through your administration interface. This is much faster than calling an external blogroll manager. </p>

<p>Themes — Iwebs comes with 20 great looking themes designed by several professional designers, which makes designing everything from the simplest blog to the most complicated webzine a piece of cake, and you can even have multiple themes with totally different looks that you switch with a single click. Have a new design every day. You can even install more designs at http://webs.investorline.co.in.  </p>

<p>Cross-blog communication tools— Iwebs fully supports both the Trackback and Pingback standards, and we are committed to supporting future standards as they develop. </p>

<p>Comments — Visitors to your site can leave comments on individual entries, and through Trackback or Pingback can comment on their own site. You can enable or disable comments on a per-post basis. </p>

<p>Spam protection — Iwebs comes with very robust tools such as an integrated blacklist and open proxy checker to manage and eliminate comment spam on your blog, and there is also a rich array of plugins that can take this functionality a step further. </p>

<p>Plugins- Iwebs comes bundles with 14 diffrent plugins which further enhances the capabilities of iwebs. To know more about the plugins that comes with standard installation visit plugins section. </p>

<p>Full user registration — Iwebs has a built-in user registration system that (if you choose) can allow people to register and maintain profiles and leave authenticated comments on your blog. You can optionally close comments for non-registered users. There are also plugins that hide posts from lower level users </p>

<p>Password Protected Posts — You can give passwords to individual posts to hide them from the public. You can also have private posts which are viewable only by their author. </p>

<p>Easy installation and upgrades — Installing iwebs and upgrading from previous versions and other software is a piece of cake. Try it and you&#39;ll wonder why all web software isn&#39;t this easy. </p>

<p>Easy Importing — We currently have importers for Movable Type, Textpattern, Greymatter, Blogger, and b2. Work on importers for Nucleus and pMachine are under way.  </p>

<p>XML-RPC interface — WordPress currently supports an extended version of the Blogger API, MetaWeblog API, and finally the MovableType API. You can even use clients designed for other platforms like Zempt. </p>

<p>Workflow — You can have types of users that can only post drafts, not publish to the front page. </p>

<p>Typographical niceties — Iwebs uses the Texturize engine to  intelligently convert plain ASCII into typographically correct XHTML entities. This includes quotes, apostrophes, ellipses, em and en dashes, multiplication symbols, and ampersands. For information about the proper use of such entities see Peter Sheerin&#39;s article The Trouble With Em ’n En. </p>

<p>Intelligent text formatting — If you&#39;ve dealt with systems that convert new lines to line breaks before you know why they have a bad name: if you have any sort of HTML they butcher it by putting tags after every new line indiscriminately, breaking your formatting and validation. Our function for this intelligently avoids places where you already have breaks and block-level HTML tags, so you can leave it on without worrying about it breaking your code. </p>

<p>Multiple authors — Iwebs&#39; highly advanced user system allows up to 10 levels of users, with different levels having different (and configurable) privileges with regard to publishing, editing, options, and other users. </p>

<p>Bookmarklets — Cross-browser bookmarklets make it easy to publish to your blog or add links to your blogroll with a minimum of effort. </p>

<p>Ping away — Iwebs supports pinging Ping-O-Matic, which means maximum exposure for your blog to search engines </p>

<p>There&#39;s much more, but these are the highlights. If there&#39;s something that you really want, submit a request on the support forums and there&#39;s a good chance someone will whip it up for you. </p>

 summary : <p>Project has moved to http://code.ticketmaster.com., </p>
 title : The one-click-installer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of this project it to create one-click software installation feature for Linux users, especially for third-party developers to provide easy way of installing their software. </p>

<p>Example: user clicks on link on web page, wizard appears which guides user through simple steps to add repository, choose what user wants to install (allowing to choose not to install for example docs) and finally installs the application and accompanying packages. User does not have to know what distribution he is using, what package type, how to add keys for digital signing, etc. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For more screenshots of wizard, see Screenshots page. </p>

<p>What one-click-installer is: </p>

<p>Simple way for users to install software without knowing what distribution you use, how to add repositories, keys, etc. Just click on link, click Next, Next, and you are done. For instructions see InstructionsForUsers. Simple way for application developers (also proprietary) of providing their apps to users. For instructions see InstructionsForApplicationDevelopers. Simple way of providing apps to users by third party packagers and loco teams. For instructions see InstructionsForPackagers. Simple way of providing apps to users by distributions. For instructions see InstructionsForDistributions. </p>

<p>What one-click-installer is not: </p>

<p>Application packaging system like deb, rpm, autopackage, etc. Package repository tool like apt, yum, etc. Package frontend like Synaptic, Adept, Yast package manager, etc. </p>

<p>Possibilities created by one-click-installer: </p>

<p>Creating web application catalog with immediate installation link, screenshots, comments, etc. Adding links to install necessary software on forums, blogs, web pages, etc. Adding links to install some software on CDs, in distribution welcome pages (for example &quot;Recommended software to install&quot;), etc. </p>

<p>Other important features: </p>

<p>Supports full localization, both installation files and installer. Integrates with native package management system, so provides automatic updates using distribution update system. </p>

<p>If you want to try out One Click Installer, please download and install package from Download section on the right (or you can browse full downloads list). Then, go to ExampleInstallationFiles page to install example applications. </p>

<p>Key points of design: </p>

<p>This project specifies file format and tools which provide such wizards for specific distributions. For installation and repository management, tools and package formats included in distribution are used, in particular, this project does not specify any new packaging format. File format allows to specify in one file  distribution-specific software channels to use for many distributions, keys, package sets , thus user does not have to know what distribution he is using. There is only one file to be clicked. Installation must be possible in localized manner, in native user language, as users not always know English. </p>

<p>More information about file format is available on OneClickInstallerFileFormat page. </p>

<p>More information about tool implementation is available on OneClickInstallerTool page. </p>

<p>Details of current impementation: </p>

<p>The tool currently works on Ubuntu using apt archives (should also work on Debian-based systems). We are looking for developers interested in extending the tool to work on other distribution/software channel (for example to handle RPMs using yum on Fedora). The tool is implemented in Python (no compilation necessary) and uses Qt for frontend. The tool is split into frontend and backend, so implementing other frontends is possible. We are looking for developers interested in porting frontend to different toolkit (especially Gtk, text frontend would also be useful).</p>
 title : The open-forum Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OpenForum is a free and open source application providing an integrated web server and Wiki. It comes ready to run and has integrated user authentication. It will run on any platform that supports Java 1.4 or later. This includes Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. Take a look at the feature list </p>

<p>Download and unzip the zip file Run the file bin/openforumwiki.bat (This starts a web server on the loop back address 127.0.0.1) Open a Web Browser and goto to page http://127.0.0.1 Please note that the openforumwiki.bat file starts the server in configuration mode with a user interface that uses a lot of processor capacity. To run the Wiki in production mode run the file run-as-service.cmd </p>

<p>Download Release 2.2 build 005There is a patch available for this release adding missing images to some page templates. Instructions can be found here </p>

<p>Documentation is included with the download, but can also be viewed on the  Project Open Forum page on One Stone Soup.org </p>

<p>Check out the  HowTo Section on One Stone Soup.orgIn addition to the standard Wiki functions of page editing, OpenForum allows the Wiki platform to be extended, tailored and integrated with existing systems. This is achieved by the use of server side Javascript scripts and Java plugins. The server side scripts can be edited from within the Wiki itself. In fact all the Wiki actions, such as editing pages, uploading attachments and controlling access are defined in Javascript scripts that can be edited from within the Wiki. </p>

<p>OpenForum has the ability to serve real-time content mixed with static content using a number of AJAX style functions. OpenForum can access databases, REST applications and Xml based web services as well as act as a source of information to other applications.  OpenForum has a rich set of template functions to enable the Wiki to have a consistent look and feel.

 title : The polypager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&quot;PolyPager&quot; is a Content Management System (CMS) for web pages.PolyPager gives you nice, simple websites. It is light-weight and preconfigured. </p>

<p>If all you want is a website, not just a blog, run by you and only you, with pages, comments, RSS-feeding, HTML templating as well as out-of-the-box HTML Editor and Image gallery - try PolyPager. It is easy to use. I know there are some real powerful and huge CMS systems out there, which give you a boat full of choices, but I guess some people don&#39;t want nor need to learn all these concepts. Featurewise, PolyPager is committed to not bloat anymore. I will work on improving what is there already. </p>

<p>PolyPager is better than any other CMS I know of in working with relational databases. If you are a developer and you want to be able to work on data from a relational database online, try PoLyPager Just tell it which table to use and how you would like to see it and it will integrate nicely with all the other pages on your site. PolyPager helps you to connect your data online by making use of your Foreign Keys. </p>

<p>a list of features: </p>

<p>simple setup (just uploading, specifying the database - done) WYSIWYG (&quot;what you see is what you get&quot;) editing - the FCKEditor is built-in (and works right away, including image/file uploads) built-in picture gallery that also works right away (Qdig Gallery) file/folder administration for admins comments/guestbooks with spam blocking all administration is done online simple pages that you can create with one click pages that reflect data from any of your MySQL tables (called &quot;complex pages&quot;) like a blog, a list of books you read etc... (some often-used complex pages are available as one-click templates - for example a blog, an FAQ etc ...) sophisticated search options RSS feeding generates a Sitemap according to the Google/Microsoft/Yahoo standard a CSS skin with several colorsets (it swaps header pictures randomly) - more are planned. HTML templating admins can edit their own CSS file online and all I forgot...</p>

 title : The tcc-juan Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Este trabalho visa apresentar os conceitos dos protocolos IPv4 e IPv6, além da diferença entre os dois e como é possível utilizá-los em coexistência na mesma rede (através de túneis ou não), ou até na mesma aplicação. Para isto é necessário os conhecimentos fundamentais sobre arquitetura de redes, através da demonstração dos modelos OSI e DARPA, ao passo que se possa compreender o estudo dos protocolos e do objetivo a ser realizado. Outro estudo a ser realizado é sobre as redes sem fio do padrão IEEE 802.11, ou WLANs, que compreendem o meio de comunicação para a mobilidade. Tudo isso se faz necessário para que se possa demonstrar as formas padronizadas pela IETF para a realização de mobilidade com cada um dos protocolos, demonstrando-as num âmbito de grandes redes, ou simplesmente em redes locais, como as WLANs. Com isso, será apresentado uma proposta de mobilidade para as redes IEEE 802.11 com protocolo IPv6, baseando-se nos modelos estudados e em algumas propostas já em funcionamento. Esta proposta será comparada com as demais e destacada o seu diferencial. Sendo assim, será testada na prática e relatada neste trabalho para destacar quais os pontos mais importantes.</p>

<p>Project Description in GermanUnser Projekt soll eine Plattform für Studenten darstellen, die alle bereits bekannten Plattformen in einem vereint. Ziel ist es, dem Studenten alle benötigten Informationen für das Studium zu bieten und im Studienalltag zu unterstützen. Die Software legt dabei den Schwerpunkt vor allem auf die Vernetzung der Studenten untereinander. Die gesamten Informationen im System werden von den Studenten selbst eingetragen und untereinander geteilt. Die Idee hinter der Entwicklung eines solchen Systems liegt darin, eine Plattform anzubieten, die alle LVAs einer Universität kennt. Zu jeder LVA gibt es einen eigenen Kalender der alle wichtigen Termine dieser beherbergt. Weiters gibt es ein eigenes Forum, in dem sich User zu den Kursen austauschen können. Es soll die Möglichkeit bestehen, für LVAs einen Prüfungsordner anzulegen, der abgehaltene Übungen und Prüfungen beinhaltet. Zu den einzelnen Kursen können Studenten bereits gelöste Übungsbeispiele posten und diese mit Lösungen Anderer vergleichen. Die Lösungen können dann von anderen Benutzern nach deren Korrektheit bewertet werden. Jeder Student hat seinen eigenen Kalender, in welchem er neben LVA-spezifischen auch eigene Termine verwalten kann. Die Studenten können mit anderen Benutzern über ein Nachrichtensystem kommunizieren. Außerdem soll es eine Art File-Sharing geben, mit dem die Benutzer Files austauschen können. Weiters unterstützt unsere Software die Studenten bei der Erstellung ihrer Stundenpläne. Dafür bietet sie eine Übersicht über bereits absolvierte Kurse sowie die noch abzulegenden Prüfungen. Um eine Aufwandsabschätzung für einzelne Kurse zu ermöglichen, können Studenten ihren eigenen Zeitaufwand nach Absolvierung eintragen. Wie bereits erwähnt soll unsere Plattform nicht zentral von einigen Administratoren gemanagt, sondern von allen Benutzern gemeinsam geleitet werden. Das heißt, Studenten erstellen die LVAs und die Termine dazu. Die einzelnen Schritte bei der Erstellung einer LVA sind, der Student legt eine neue LVA an und gibt einen Link zur TUWIS Seite dieser LVA an, dann werden alle Daten von dieser Seite eingelesen und in die LVA eingetragen. Anschließend kann der Ersteller dann die eingelesenen Daten editieren. Hat der Ersteller etwas vergessen, kann ein anderer Benutzer einfach die fehlenden Daten ergänzen. Studienpläne müssen von Studenten ebenfalls selber eingeben werden, ist jedoch ein ähnlicher Studienplan schon vorhanden kann nach diesen gesucht werden. Hat man einen ähnlichen Studienplan gefunden kann dieser entsprechend geändert und unter einem neuen Namen gespeichert werden.</p>

 title : The owed Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In today’s information age, the availability and accuracy of large amounts of web-based information can be attributed to the creation and usage of various types of collaborative software. One type of collaborative software in particular, the wiki, allows groups of people to freely create and change articles of information. With a large base of users collaboratively making small changes to a broad range of articles, a broad variety of information can be created and maintained, which has been effectively demonstrated by the popular online encyclopedia www.wikipedia.org. </p>

<p>Our plan is to extend the ideas of the wiki and collaboration to the realm of technical documentation. Because multiple writers often create and simultaneously edit the same technical document before their release, we would like to create an integrated system where these writers and editors can discuss and collaborate on changes to documents. </p>

<p>One of our main design concerns is open collaboration. To this end we have selected XML Docbook as the open format for technical documents in our system. XML docbook is an open standard for describing documents with complex logical layouts. The primary work of this project involves creating a document editor which combines the ability to create XML Docbook documentation with the ability to attach comments and suggestions to specific sections of the document. The system will allow users to use other XML Docbook tools in collaboration with ours. </p>

<p>The main advantage of our software is the ability to attach comments to a part of a document or proposed change. To make this more convenient we will provide a web interface mostly focused on discussions. This will enable users to discuss the documents from any computer without special software. </p>

 title : The ringmywiki Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Speech-based Wiki allows users to create and collaboratively annotate (i.e. edit, comment, augment) speech on their mobile devices. Revisions are chronologically stored and old versions can be rolled back at users&#39; choice. Similar to textual Wikis, Speech-based Wiki also allows users to subjectively create hyperlinks from segment(s) within audio clip to another audio clip or its segment(s). These hyperlinks can also be created automatically by predefined Wiki logic (e.g. speech with similar subject). For easy retrieval, users can tag the audio clip with text-based, audio-based keywords and etc. Clips with similar tags are clustered upon retrieval. </p>

<p>Speech-based Wiki reduces transaction overhead by adopting a natural way to record and consume audio-based contents. Through pure speech interface, users (e.g. drivers, vision-impaired) can participate in collaborative tasks without reading the screen. Unlike conventional Wikis, Speech-based Wiki does not intend to manage large scale knowledge references like Wikipedia, it is designed for more efficient knowledge capturing, elaborating and sharing among distributed peers. The major difference between Speech-based Wiki and other audio-mediated communication tools is that Audio Wiki is not only used for transmitting thoughts but also used for integrating individuals&#39; thoughts into a re-accessible, joint effort speech. </p>

 summary : <p>Project InfoThe aim of this project is to create an exemplary collaborative testing tool called TPTeam by using the Eclipse Equinox and Communication Framework (ECF) projects.  This goal is achieved by the development of three components:  </p>

<p>TPBuddy™, a client GUI utilizing the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) TPBridge™, an event-driven plug-in that bridges communication across Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) using the freely available infrastructure of Google Talk. TPManager™, a server-side test management plug-in.     	 All three components utilize a novel service-oriented architecture derived from Equinox and distributed events to achieve collaborative unit testing.  Out-of-JVM communication is done via instant messaging through Google Talk servers and the open Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Tests are executed in the form of Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform (TPTP) JUnit testsuites, which allow for server-side management.  The work represents a practical first step in utilizing newly available Eclipse open source projects and public infrastructure for the creation of collaborative tools. </p>

<p>NewsSeptember 22, 2007Added the TPTeam Harvard Master&#39;s degree thesis to the downloads section.  This thesis would be a good read for anyone interested in developing an Eclipse RCP app, connecting it to Hibenate, or embedding an Eclipse instance within a servlet container. </p>

 summary : <p>Enkel faktureringFryktelig Fin Faktura er et fakturaprogram for norske forhold. Fakturaene lages på PDF eller skjema F60.   </p>

<p>Det er fritt, åpent og gratis, og laget for linux og windows (mac-versjon kommer!). </p>

<p>Mai 2009: 2.0.6b for UbuntuUbuntu 9.04 og fremtidige Debian-systemer har lagt om måten python-moduler skal installeres. Derfor har jeg lastet opp en ny .deb-pakke, som skal løse installasjonsproblemer på disse systemene. </p>

<p>Last ned her: finfaktura_2.0.6b_all.deb </p>

<p>April 2009: ny versjon 2.0.6Litt vårrengjøring førte til en ny bugfiks-versjon. Last ned fra lista til høyre. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Slik ser Finfaktura2 ut </p>

<p>Flere bilder av programmet </p>

<p>Mars 2009: ny installer for windowsJeg har laget et nytt installasjonsprogram for windows. Det passer  både for oppgraderinger og ny-installasjoner. Dermed blir det mindre å laste ned. </p>

<p>Last ned her: finfaktura-2.0.6-netinstaller.exe </p>

<p>OppgraderingOppgi stien til din eksisterende finfakturainstallasjon, så vil programmet oppgradere de nødvendige filene og intet annet. </p>

<p>Ny-installasjonProgrammet merker at finfaktura ikke er installert fra før, og laster ned de nødvendige filene fra nettet. Det betyr at du må ha kontakt med internett under installeringen. </p>

<p>Mars 2009: bugfiks-versjon 2.0.5Nå er alle BBS&#39; krav til blanketten er oppfylt. Kontonummer som begynner på 0 kan brukes. Alle endringer: </p>

<p>f60.py: massive forbedringer av blanketten (stor takk til cbrattli), se &amp;nbsp;issue#38&amp;nbsp; f60.py: skriver beløp i kroner og med kommaskilletegn f60.py: Fiks i mod10-algoritme, og inn med mod11 (KID) - igjen, takk til cbrattli. f60.py: Spesifisert momsgrunnlag fiks utskrift av kontonummer som starter på 0 (&amp;nbsp;issue#47&amp;nbsp; igjen) Laster logoer på en annen måte (forhåpentlig løser dette &amp;nbsp;issue#48&amp;nbsp;) Mac-versjonen vil ta fortsatt noe tid (beklager!) </p>

<p>Januar 2009: bugfiks-versjon 2.0.1Tre viktige fikser tvang frem en ny versjon. </p>

<p>Fikser feil som inntrer når ny faktura skal lages, og noe av informasjonen om firmaet mangler (&amp;nbsp;issue#45&amp;nbsp;) -- takk, Audun! Fikser feil som gir alle fakturaer dagens dato Fikser feil på windows når brukernavnet inneholder æøå (ikke-ascii tegn) Desember 2008: stabil versjon 2.0Etter et halvt års utvikling er programmet endelig stabilt nok til versjon 2.0. </p>

<p>Programmet har fått en ansiktsløfting (&amp;nbsp;issue#3&amp;nbsp;), og har også fått noe ny funksjonalitet. Fra endringsloggen: </p>

<p>Fikser rapport.py: utskrift av pdf og rapport fra firma med &#39;&amp;&#39; i firmanavnet (&amp;nbsp;issue#43&amp;nbsp;) -- takk, Eivind! Fikser scrollelinjer dersom skjermen/vinduet er mindre enn informasjonen som skal vises -- takk, Johan! Bedre installasjon på Debian/Ubuntu Fikser vising av PDF på windows Logoer og dokumenter installeres Grensesnittet er portert til PyQt4 (&amp;nbsp;issue#3&amp;nbsp;) og redesignet Det går an å føre halve antall av varer (f.eks. timer) (&amp;nbsp;issue#22&amp;nbsp;) Kan sette vilkårlig forfallsdato på ny faktura (&amp;nbsp;issue#25&amp;nbsp;) (Programmet behøver nå minimum PyQt4.4) </p>

 summary : <p>This is a tiny application I made for reading the news feed from Google Reader. It&#39;s made in C++ with the Curl library, and it&#39;s using gtkmm for GUI. I&#39;m working on getting gtkhtml to work as well, so if you want to compile the code you will need to either link the gtkhtml-library, or comment out the gtkhtml-parts of the code. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not yet complete however, since I can&#39;t seem to get it to change the state of the news entries - so any news that are read are not actually updated in the google reader database. Any attempts I&#39;ve made to do this ends up with Google returning an http error 400. Any tips on how to fix this is welcome. :) </p>

<p>The project file included is a Code::Blocks project, but C::B is not required for compiling. </p>

 title : The jfg-old Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The idea of this library is to create forms based on object atributes instead of having to write all the layout code by hand. To do that, it uses object reflection and a lightweight MVC model, where the programmer have only to write the model code. </p>

<p>Sometimes you are writing a POC or wants easy access to the attributes of some object (or even wants a simple form requesting some data from an user) but don&#39;t want the burden to write a GUI for that. In this cases jfg came at hand. It allows the creation of simple forms with 2 lines of code, and supports the basic java types, recursive objects (aka one object as a field of the other), static attributes (if it recives a Class)  and listeners for the model. It can apply the user input automatically or only when requested.</p>

 summary : <p>O crescente uso de programação orientada a objetos (POO) tem levado universidades de todo o mundo a adotarem Java como linguagem de programação nos cursos introdutórios de ciência da computação.</p>

<p>Entretanto, a riqueza de detalhes de Java, podendo mesmo ser dito como excessiva, têm dificultado o aprendizado dos alunos mais inexperientes, que precisam dominar vários conceitos avançados, mesmo se for para fazer um exercício simples.</p>

<p>Neste cenário, grupos em diversas partes do mundo tem procurado criar ferramentas e metodologias que facilitem a assimilação dos alunos iniciantes. Na disciplina de Introdução a Programação do curso regular de ciência da computação do Centro de Informática da UFPE, esta iniciativa foi transformada no projeto miniJava.</p>

<p>O projeto miniJava é um conjunto de API&#39;s, ferramentas e modelo de programação simplificado, desenvolvido de forma a facilitar o aprendizado de programação. Apenas um subconjunto restrito de classes e funções deverão estar disponíveis. Utilizando recursos mais simples, os alunos iniciantes irão ter seu aprendizado muito mais facilitado, visto que terão acesso a recursos importantes, sem perder tempo com outras características que não são importantes, no ponto de vista conceitual.</p>

<p># Project Guidelines #Tabellone: Si implementa un gioco su tabellone: ogni giocatore ha dei possedimenti, del denaro, una pedina su una determinata casella del tabellone. Il sistema gestisce l&#39;avvicendarsi dei turni dei diversi giocatori e l&#39;avanzamento delle loro pedine secondo il risultato del lancio dei dadi; se entrambi i dadi hanno lo stesso numero, il giocatore ha diritto a un secondo turno. Il tabellone è formato da caselle unite in modo circolare. Le caselle possono essere di diverso tipo: </p>

<p> Ci sono caselle che possono essere acquistate (società , stazioni e terreni)  Ci sono caselle sulle quali il giocatore può anche costruire (solo terreni)  Ci sono delle caselle che non sono nè acquistabili nè possedibili (esempio prigione, imprevisti o probabilità) Quando un giocatore capita su un terreno:  se la casella è possedibile ed è ancora proprietà della banca, il giocatore può scegliere se acquistare il terreno (che ha un prezzo); altrimenti il terreno rimane alla banca e il giocatore non paga nulla.  se la casella è possedibile ed è proprietà di un altro giocatore, chi vi capita deve pagare un affitto (proprietà di ogni singolo terreno) al proprietario. L&#39;affitto è doppio se il proprietario possiede tutti i terreni dello stesso colore (o tutte le società dello stesso tipo o, ancora, tutte le stazioni).  se un giocatore capita sopra ad un terreno di sua proprietà, il terreno è edificabile e possiede tutti i terreni di quel colore allora può costruirvi case o alberghi. Le prime hanno un costo di 50 euro, i secondi hanno un costo di 100 euro.  se un giocatore passa sopra ad un terreno sul quale sono stati costruiti case o alberghi paga al proprietario del terreno un&#39;indennità pari a quella dovuta per il terreno più 10 euro per ogni casa presente e 30 euro per ogni albergo presente. </p>

<p>Extra per il tabellone: </p>

<p>Prigione </p>

<p> Quando un giocatore capita sulla casella prigione non accade nulla  Quando un giocatore capita sulla casella “Vai in prigione!” allora viene spostato alla casella prigione e vi rimane per due turni </p>

<p>Imprevisti e probabilità: </p>

<p> Quando un giocatore capita su una casella imprevisti o su una casella probabilità deve pescare una carta, rispettivamente, di imprevisti o di probabilità.  Si scelgano 4 imprevisti e 4 probabilità da implementare da quelli del monopolj (o potete anche inventarveli)  È richiesto di implementare tra le probabilità la carta esci gratis di prigione che, quando il giocatore che la possiede va in prigione, gli permette di uscire subito di prigione. </p>

<p>Svolgimento del gioco: </p>

<p>Giocatori: </p>

<p> I giocatori usano tutti la stessa macchina e la stessa interfaccia utente a turni.  Vengono tutti creati all&#39;inizio del gioco  Hanno una somma di danaro come budget iniziale e partono tutti dalla casella via.  Possono abbandonare il gioco in qualsiasi momento, in tal caso tutti i loro possedimenti passano alla banca.  Il gioco decide quando arriva il turno di un giocatore  Quando è il suo turno il giocatore lancia i dadi e si muove sul tabellone del numero di caselle risultante dal punteggio dei dadi, se fa un doppio ha diritto a giocare subito un altro turno.  Nel momento in cui un giocatore capita su una casella ci sono una serie di azioni che può fare. Alcune di esse possono essere obbligatorie (ad esempio pagare l&#39;affitto oppure pescare una carta), altre facoltative (ad esempio acquistare il terreno o costruire). Naturalmente non tutte le azioni sono sempre disponibili (esempio non si può costruire se non si hanno tutti i terreni di uno stesso colore).  Il giocatore decide quando termina il suo turno. Quando questo accade allora la mano passa al giocatore successivo. </p>

<p>Fine del gioco: Quando un giocatore finisce i soldi e non è in grado di pagare una tassa o un affitto, il giocatore esce dal gioco e tutti i suoi possedimenti passano alla banca. </p>

<p>Presentazione delle informazioni: Durante il corso del progetto vi si chiederà di utilizzare diverse interfacce utente. Inizialmente sarà richiesto di fornire una semplice interfaccia testuale; successivamente sarà richiesto di creare anche una seconda interfaccia utente, che si basa su SWING. Per questo motivo le informazioni devono essere gestite in maniera indipendente dalla rappresentrazione, in modo da aiutarvi a separare l&#39;interfaccia utente dalla logica che deve rappresentare (e non lasciarvi inserire il codice per l&#39;interfaccia all&#39;interno della logica del gioco in modo che al momento di passare dall&#39;interfaccia testuale all&#39;interfaccia grafica non dovrete modificare l&#39;intero sistema). </p>

<p>Per questi motivi vi chiediamo di creare per ogni interfaccia utente una classe che implementi l&#39;interfaccia programmativa &#39;UserInterfaceConnector&#39;. Questa classe deve prendere le informazioni dalla logica del gioco e tradurle in un formato che l&#39;interfaccia utente possa capire (ad esempio il componente per l&#39;interfaccia testuale restituisce delle stringhe, quello per l&#39;interfaccia grafica può restituire altre cose).La vostra interfaccia utente dovrà poi usare il componente che implementa &#39;UserInterfaceConnector&#39;. </p>

 title : The odvr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>odvrodvr is a user-space driver for USB-enabled Olympus DVRs that do not support the USB Mass Storage specification. odvr is tested against the VN-960PC, but should support other &quot;VN&quot; Olympus models. See SupportedDevices for a list of known-working devices.  </p>

<p>Notice: Testers are always needed! If you own a device with unsupported status, or experience any issue with a device that odrv claims support for, report back success or failure in the issue tracker! </p>

<p>DEVELOPERS WANTEDodvr development has been standing still for some time, mostly due to a lack of time and the death of the main developer&#39;s Olympus hardware. Developers and project maintainers are wanted! Reply to Issue #34 if you are interested. </p>

<p>News2009-09-26: odvr 0.1.5 released. This release includes small fixes, but also includes a raw download option. This is useful for advanced users trying to decode PULCOD files found on VN-xx00PC devices. A full Wine development environment, a DLL file, blood, sweat, and tears may be required! </p>

<p>2008-04-14: odvr 0.1.4.1 released. This is a bugfix release (no new features). </p>

<p>2008-04-09: odvr 0.1.4 released. Special thanks goes to conor.home for his patches. This release features: </p>

<p>Support for scheduled (S) folder. Support D folder on newer devices. Delete all recordings or just recordings in a single folder. </p>

<p>2008-01-24: odvr 0.1.3 released. This release adds support for XHQ audio on VN-xx00PC models. HQ, LP, and SP is still unsupported on VN-xx00PC models. </p>

<p>2008-01-13: odvr 0.1.2 is released. This release fixes various bugs, verified support for older models, like the VN-120PC and VN-240PC, a &quot;make install&quot; target, and a few odds and ends.</p>
 title : The opencoeli Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: this project is going to be renamed to Asterope </p>

<p>OpenCoeli [ce:li] is astronomical planetarium, skycharting and observation planning tool.  Main goal is to create easily  extendable replacement for XEphem. First stable version should be around 2011. </p>

<p>MotivationMain reason for new program is better code. It allows more features, better stability and more  enjoyable codding. OpenCoeli is written in Java and Groovy. OpenCoeli is using standard Java libraries: Spring IOC, Java Persistence API, JUnit, Apache Commons,  Jide, Picollo. It also uses some astronomy specific libraries: Skyview, Healpix, Pixy2... </p>

<p>DataData (stars, galaxies) are represented in data model (POJO) and persisted with JPA to  embedded SQL database.  This approach allows great flexibility. For example star can  be linked with multiple catalogs, magnitudes and observations, but it still unique in data  storage. </p>

<p>Data model is designed around professional catalogs from Astronomical Data Center.  It can support all available fields: for example star can have multiple magnitudes in various  wavelengths with errors and references to publication.   </p>

<p>SQL is combined with Healpix spatial index. So it is possible to query data like: </p>

<p>SELECT star WHERE (position in Lyra) AND (magnitude &lt; 3.0) 
<br/>    AND (distance from M57 &lt; 2 degrees)          </p>

<p>Maps and imagesOpenCoeli produces maps in printable quality. It is inspired by PP3, but goes farer. For example label  overlapping problem is solved by AI algorithm.  Objects on map are represented in terms of layers,  graphical nodes and events. So map is  not static, but can be manipulated after creation. </p>

<p>Map generation is based on SkyView survey image generator.  But it can be also used to generate  background images for maps.   Since it runs on your computer,  you are not limited by online servers.  DSS image 10000x10000 pixels in 30x30 degrees? No problem. </p>

<p>Pixy2 code is used to handle FITS images.  It handles  astrometry and photometry. It can also identify objects on image. And finally it can fine align image coordinates using stars.</p>
 summary : <p>Welcome to optparse_gui!   </p>

<p>What is optparse_gui?optparse_gui is a python module which can be described simply by: import optparse_gui as optparse </p>

<p>optparse_gui is a drop-in replacement for optparse. It allows entering command line arguments in a dynamically generated wx-based dialog. </p>

<p>optparse is a great built-in python module for parsing command line arguments. see http://docs.python.org/lib/module-optparse.html for more info. </p>

<p>Features</p>

<p>  optparse_gui generates the dialog depending on the provided optparse options: CheckBox for boolean options, ComboBox for &quot;choice&quot; options, TextCtrl for all other options. An extra TextCtrl for entering non-option command line arguments. Also, the dialog contains context-sensitive help for every option. </p>

<p>Ever wanted to transparently add a GUI to your command-line driven python scripts?  This is the module for you. </p>

<p>How to use it?Like the title says - simply &quot;import optparse_gui as optparse&quot; </p>

<p>A more elaborate use case might be to use optparse_gui when the application is ran with no command line arguments ( i.e. a double-click on the module&#39;s icon ), but use the original optparse to handle the command line arguments if they are given. </p>

<p>That way, a user can drive your app using a GUI, and yet - the app can be automated by passing command line arguments. </p>

<p>Here is a sample( this is what you see in the screen-shot above ): </p>

<p>import sys
<br/>import optparse
<br/>import optparse_gui</p>

<p>def main():
<br/>    usage = &quot;usage: %prog [options] args&quot;
<br/>    if 1 == len( sys.argv ):
<br/>        option_parser_class = optparse_gui.OptionParser
<br/>    else:
<br/>        option_parser_class = optparse.OptionParser
<br/>        
<br/>    parser = option_parser_class( usage = usage, version=&#39;0.1&#39; )
<br/>    parser.add_option(&quot;-f&quot;, &quot;--file&quot;, dest=&quot;filename&quot;, default = r&#39;c:\sample.txt&#39;,
<br/>                      help=&quot;read data from FILENAME&quot;)
<br/>    parser.add_option(&quot;-a&quot;, &quot;--action&quot;, dest=&quot;action&quot;,
<br/>                      choices = [&#39;delete&#39;, &#39;copy&#39;, &#39;move&#39;],
<br/>                      help=&quot;Which action do you wish to take?!&quot;)
<br/>    parser.add_option(&quot;-n&quot;, &quot;--number&quot;, dest=&quot;number&quot;, default = 23,
<br/>                      type = &#39;int&#39;,
<br/>                      help=&quot;Just a number&quot;)
<br/>    parser.add_option(&quot;-v&quot;, &quot;--verbose&quot;,
<br/>                      action=&quot;store_true&quot;, dest=&quot;verbose&quot;,
<br/>                      help = &#39;To be or not to be? ( verbose )&#39;)
<br/>    
<br/>    options, args = parser.parse_args()</p>

<p>    print &#39;args: %s&#39; % args
<br/>    print &#39;options: %s&#39; % options</p>

<p>if &#39;__main__&#39; == __name__:

 title : The static-trail-explorer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is envisioned as a piece of companion software for the mobile-trail-explorer JavaME application. </p>

<p>Current StatusThis project is in it&#39;s EARLY, EARLY stages, it currently takes NO INPUT, and only displays output as TEXT to the System.out console. </p>

<p>Can now connect to Bluetooth-GPS device (on COM4) Can parse location information (using (very) slightly modified versions of some of mobile-trail-explorer&#39;s classes) </p>

<p>The DreamI really like mobile-trail-explorer (MTE), and I record many trails and trecks using it. I feel the need, however, for a bigger companion version for my PC. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like this to be able to do everything MTE can do (taking advantage of the bigger screen &amp; processing power of course), but also: </p>

<p>Manage all my trails from MTE Edit trails I would also see this (in the distant future) as being a place to test new ideas for MTE (because of the easier &amp; quicker development cycle for JavaSE compared to JavaME) I think the Open Street Map people might have some ideas for how this might help them, as I know some of them use MTE to record trails And much more What YOU can doAny comments about the direction this should take would be appreciated, anything I missed in &#39;The Dream&#39;, in terms of applications it could be put to etc. Getting a handle on this early on could really help with the design of the system. Use the discussion group to make your ideas heard. </p>

<p>Any other thoughts you might have are also welcome. Again, the discussion group is the place for this. </p>

<p>If you can program, and are interested, you could join the team and help this project get off the ground. </p>

<p>Programming LanguageThis application is written in JAVA-SE. </p>

<p>InstallationCurrently only works from an IDE (i.e. only from my Eclipse) on Windows(should work on other OSs, but haven&#39;t tested it, but .dll&#39;s are included somewhere for installing on MAC &amp; Linux. </p>

<p>As the com stuff is NON-STANDARD for JAVA, you&#39;ll need to copy 2 .dll files into your java root directory, this is messy (for JAVA) and I&#39;ll put up a better description of how this is done in the near future.</p>

<p>Présentation / OverviewSudokuJ est une application développée dans le cadre d&#39;un projet de 4e année Informatique de l&#39;INSA de Rennes. Il se base sur les langages Java, pour l&#39;interface utilisateur (Swing) et C++ pour le noyau. </p>

<p>Le but du logiciel est de développer un programme qui génère des grilles de Sudoku de difficulté variable et de permettre de jouer, en utilisant les possibilités d&#39;interaction entre Java et C++ (JNI). Ce logiciel étend les possibilités en ajoutant un mode Créateur, où il est possible de créer ses propres grilles ou bien de trouver la solution d&#39;une grille d&#39;un magazine, par exemple. </p>

<p>SudokuJ is a software developed as a response for a project of the 4th year of the computer science department at the INSA (National Institute of Applied Sciences) of Rennes. It&#39;s based on both Java, for the user interface (Swing), and C++ for the core. </p>

<p>The goal of this program is to generate and to play with Sudoku grids of different difficulty levels using the interaction between Java and C++ (JNI). This software extends this features by adding a Creator mode which allows to create his or her own grids or find the solution of a magazine&#39;s ones, for example. </p>

 summary : <p>This project is intended to be a solution for people who no longer want to deal with the billing and accounting part of running a web business.  The hope is that it will have the following features:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1 - Automatic invoicing / billing / and receipt sending on a monthly / quarterly schedule
<br/> 2 - Ledger which will track a daily bank account balance, with profit and loss information
<br/> 3 - tax suggestions for all expenses entered into the leger.  (I.e. Government allows 100% of necessary expenses to be written off.  This should have categories for each type of expense.)
<br/> 4 - Estimated tax liability to the government according to your tax bracket.
<br/> 5 - trouble ticket system where clients can submit trouble tickets.  These trouble tickets would be able to be tracked according to which clients are putting the most support tickets in.  This will also allow for time tracking which will then perfectly represent how much a client owes.  This extra time will be added to the monthly billing amount.</p>

 title : The bizentass Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bizentass is a general purpose business tool realised as a MS-Excel template. It enables the price analysis of different commodities dealt in any business at different stages and sets a platform for right strategy making thereby helping increase in margins and sales in short and long terms. It saves a lot of time in doing that than in many other ways. </p>

<p>For those businesses that have already been using different software for billing and accounting with inventory like Tally, Sify Forum, etc, this acts as a collaborator. Using corresponding software options, data in this file may be exported into the database over which the inventory, billing and accounting software work. This is in particular true for the software operating upon MS SQL server as database. Using suitable interfaces, the estimate sheet may also be transferred into billing environment.  </p>

<p>For those businesses that use a pc only for accounting purposes and for those who don’t use pc for business, but have one at disposal, Bizentass not only makes analysis and strategy making very simple but also provides the lists for sale and cost prices as chosen and with use of conditional formatting appropriately in sheets, making it extremely useful for the businessman.</p>

 title : The carbondatabase Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Grails application used to calculate carbon use for organisations.  </p>

<p>Intended for organisations that require some reporting on carbon use by constituents. Could also be used by individual organisations that require a system to record carbon use of business units.  </p>

<p>Each sub-organisation registers and answers a questionnaire. The questionnaire which is configurable using the admin area, leads the sub-organisation through calculating carbon use. The sub-organisation then can use this to report to the parent organisation  who in turn reports to their administrative body. The application could also be used for tracking changes in carbon use over time and as an educational tool so as to encourage a reduction in carbon generation through better sharing of ideas for efficiency. </p>

<p>To get started you will need to:  </p>

<p>download the sources change datasource.groovy to point to a local database. This has been tested on postgres.  change bootstrap.groovy to create a default web-application user download and install grails do &quot;grails run-app&quot; </p>

<p>Either use the administration area to change the types, questions etc. It currently gets CO2-e values from the Australian Government Greenhouse  </p>

<p>to run this on your own web-server: </p>

<p>enter &quot;grails war&quot;.  dump and import the database created when getting started deploy the generated web application You will probably want to create a new web-site. </p>

<p>The admin area will be located in http://</p>

Simple is slightly better than correct (New Jersey school) Accounting is fundamentally a  simple process and the code should mirror that. The design should push for simplicity at all costs; the failing test cases should inch us towards correctness. Testing should be easy- describing the Chart of Accounts and Transactions using YAML helps here. An accounting system in python should use a Currency type for storing and handling money</p>

 title : The geogia Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Geogia is an effort to build an Enterprise Resource Planning system using Grails (http://grails.org). We use UML diagrams (http://neogia.org/UML_Diagram) from project Neogia as references, and domain classes are generated from Apache OFBiz. </p>

<p>Geogia Sub-projects are: </p>

<p>ZK Plugin for Grails - A plugin that enables ZK as a view technology for Grails. It is a fork of the original ZK Grails Plugin. Currently, scaffold generator is being developed. OFBiz Domain Generator - A script that generates Grails-compatible domain classes from Apache OFBiz entities. Some features, e.g enumeration generator and Hibernate View generator, are still missing. TSpec - A Behaviour-driven development (BDD) framework with Thai syntax. For those who prefers English BDD, you may find easyb. </p>

<p>Latest News8-Jun-2008 </p>

<p>Geogia will be upgrading to Grails 1.0.3. A new approach to generate Grails domain classes is being investigated. We are stepping closer to directly use OFBiz&#39;s entitymodels. 8-Feb-2008 Grails 1.0 has been released and Geogia has now updated. Code generation is also getting better. We are now using Groovy parser to format the generated codes. 21-Dec-2007 Geogia has been updated to use Grails 1.0 RC3/Groovy 1.5. It will be continuously updated toward Grails 1.0. 18-Dec-2007 Groovy-MDA code is embedded into Geogia in the the form of Grails plugin. A new specific script &quot;XmiGen&quot; has been created. Now Geogia is self-contained and this is going to be a good start for MDA plugin for Grails. 13-Sep-2007 Groovy-MDA has released its 1.1-snapshot, which supports input pre-processing. Geogia project uses this snapshot to build a generator, called Geogia-XMI. </p>

<p>This project is kindly sponsored by Poseidon UML from Gentleware AG. </p>

 title : The gracedm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Grace?The Grace Donation Manager handles the tracking of donations and donors for a non-profit organization. As donations come in for particular funds, the donation is recorded along with the donor&#39;s information. Grace also handles the printing of receipts &amp; reports and facilitates common administrative operations like bank deposits and exporting of data to an accounting package. </p>

<p>Grace is well-suited for both the individual fundraiser as well as small-to-medium-sized organizations, and runs on both Windows (XP/Vista/7) and Linux operating systems. </p>

<p>Grace is free software and is released under the GNU Public License (GPL), which means that the source code for Grace is freely available – and always will be – and therefore can be modified to meet your organization&#39;s needs. </p>

<p>Project featuresCreate a deposit and enter donations into that deposit. Multiple line items (recipients) possible for each donation. Streamlined data entry and finalizing of a deposit. Create multiple funds to receive donations. Print receipts for donors. Print reports for fund owners (or output to PDF). Export to external accounting system. Notify fund owners of donations by email. Multiple, concurrent users with extensive logging. Copy deposits for easy re-entry of repeated sets of donations. Rapid, extensive search for deposits, donations, and donors. Runs on Microsoft Windows XP / Vista / 7, 32-bit and 64-bit editions. Note: See Installing for important details for Windows 7 users. Runs on Linux, 32-bit and 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu.) GPL-licensed open source software for infinite flexibility to meet your needs.  See ScreenShots. NewsFebruary 12, 2010: Grace 0.5.2 releasedThis update fixes two significant bugs: </p>

<p>When fixing a donation and changing the date of the new donation, the negating donation was given the wrong date. Some reports listed donations in reverse order from what was expected. </p>

<p>It is recommended that all Grace users update to this release. </p>

<p>Follow the install/upgrade instructions in the user manual. </p>

<p>August 25, 2009: Grace 0.5.1 releasedAnother day, another bugfix! =)  This version fixes critical bugs for Derby (&quot;Standard installation&quot;) users.   </p>

Added ability to save default &quot;seal&quot; preferences.  Added ability to delete funds (which have no associated donations.) Added functionality to meet needs for 501(c)(3) accrual accounting methodology.  All reports now use the deposit&#39;s posted date (rather than sealed date) to determine date ranges to report on. The &quot;View Recent Giving&quot; button in donor search dialogs now returns only the past two years&#39; giving rather than all giving (&quot;View Giving History&quot;).

 title : The smartmoney Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Similar to some commercial products (like MoneyManager) &quot;smartmoney&quot; is a simple mobile application to track expenses. The emphasis lies on performance and a rich export-functionality to easily export &quot;on-the-fly&quot; tracked expenses to other finance/accounting tools like MSMoney, ERP-Systems and more. &quot;smartmoney&quot; is NOT a standalone application for managing financial accounts. It needs to be used in conjunction with those tools. The design will support an open interface for plugable, third-party &quot;connectors&quot; to export data and an adjustable data-model for the expenses to be tracked.

 title : The avbin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AVbin is a thin wrapper around FFmpeg, providing binary compatibility for applications and languages that need it. </p>

<p>DetailsFFmpeg is a collection of audio and video codecs widely used in projects such as mplayer, xine, gstreamer and VLC.  It is under continuous development; so much so that its developers rarely provide a release, and SVN snapshots of the library must be statically linked to avoid version incompatibilities. </p>

<p>AVbin allows programs that require dynamic linkage to use FFmpeg.  It does this by providing </p>

<p>an accurate version number within the shared library, allowing applications to select the appropriate data structures and functions to use at runtime, and a simplified interface with an unchanging ABI to the most common decoding functionality within FFmpeg. AVbin is distributed as a single dynamic library (.so on Linux, .dylib on Mac OS X, and .dll on Windows) that depends on no other files or installations.  This eliminates the many complexities of building FFmpeg on platforms other than Linux; however you can still build it from source if you prefer. </p>

<p>For usersDownload the appropriate binary package from the downloads page. </p>

<p>Windows users, this is avbin-win32-5.zip Mac OS X users, this is avbin-darwin-universal-5.zip Linux users, this is either avbin-linux-x86-32-7.tar.gz or avbin-linux-x86-64-7.tar.gz Inside the archive you will find a single shared library, which needs to be copied into the appropriate directory for your system.  Details can be found in the accompanying readme file. </p>

<p>For developersYou can use AVbin in one of two ways.  Linking against the avbin shared library provides all libavcodec, libavutil and libavformat functions.  You can use the avbin_get_ffmpeg_revision function to determine the exact version of FFmpeg that has been linked, and use the appropriate data structures and functions. </p>

<p>Because the FFmpeg interface changes quite quickly, AVbin also provides a simpler interface that is guaranteed to be backward and forward compatible with future releases.  The source release contains a header file and HTML documentation for this interface.</p>

 title : The checkpoint Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Checkpoint media archive systemIntroductionCheckpoint watches all the files in a directory (recursively), and allows you to revert your directory to any point in the past that you did a &#39;commit&#39; to save your changes. This is useful for graphic designers, animators, musicians, and anyone looking for an easy way to version large files.  </p>

<p>A command-line-utility is included for regular users so they can periodically save snapshots of their files and restore files from that history. Also, a python API is exposed for developers to integrate into Content Management Systems and other software requiring simple file versioning. </p>

<p>What&#39;s a Media Archive System?  Is this a Version Control System?While excellent Version Control Systems such as Bazaar and Mercurial already  exist in python implementations, they are optimized for managing changes to  source code using diffs.  They can and do handle binary files, but  binary file operations are not blazingly fast.  From the Bazaar FAQ: </p>

<p>... [bazaar] is primarily a source code control system, not a  
<br/>media archive system. So it is not a priority to support enormous 
<br/>(hundred-megabyte) binaries or multi-gigabyte trees. There are other  
<br/>tools better suited to that. 
<br/>Checkpoint was specifically optimized to quickly manipulate binary files.  </p>

<p>The other main difference between Checkpoint and a Version Control System (VCS) is that Checkpoint detects your file changes automatically. In a VCS you have to &#39;add&#39; files to the repository using special commands such as `svn add somefile.txt`. While those VCS commands are helpful in managing source code projects to eliminate storage of intermediary files and generated files, in a Media-Archive System hard drive space is sacrificed for ease of use. </p>

<p>Also of great importance, the Checkpoint command-line utility is incredibly easy to understand, so regular users don&#39;t have to learn complex VCS terminology and concepts. </p>

 title : The cherubim-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a small private project, that&#39;s just up here, so that I&#39;ve got some SVN Server to host it on ;) Fell free to roam around the code but keep in mind, that nothing here is final and will for sure change. </p>

<p>If you want to use some of this code or this library in your project: </p>

<p>I&#39;m far, far, far (did I say far) away from being done this code is NOT 100% tested yet (except for the things in the unit tests)
<br/>keep in mind, that everything (except the lib folder) is under BSD license
<br/>the RenderLib is currently in a concept stage so you should ignore most of it at the moment
<br/>   At the current state the visual studio solution is not usable, as I want to get the OSX version of the RenderLib done first before doing anything on the DirectX / Windows part of Cherubim. That means: the code will compile with XCode/OpenGL but most likely neither run nor produce correct results.</p>

 title : The ckrspec Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a framework for Behavior Spec Driven Design; which is the development method also known as Behavior Driven Development and Test Driven Development. </p>

<p>The target language is modern implementations of C++. </p>

<p>In the BSDD process, the programmer goes through the following steps in approximately five minutes: </p>

<p>1. create a &quot;spec&quot; - an executable specification for some behavior. 2. execute the spec -- it should fail because that behavior doesn&#39;t exit yet. 3. create just enough code to implement the behavior 4. execute the spec -- it should pass now if the code is correct. (If not passing, fix the code). 5. clean up the code -- refactoring to improve the design and eliminate duplication. 6. execute the specs -- they should still pass after refactoring (if not passing, undo the refactoring and/or fix the problem) </p>

<p>Repeat steps 1 - 6 - executing ALL the existing specs in step 4.  Step 5 may not be done every time through the cycle. </p>

<p>Like chess, the rules are simple, but there is a lot to learn about writing small specs, writing small amounts of code to pass the specs, and refactoring to improve the design of the whole product. </p>

<p>Most of the C++ framework is not dependent on operating system or other packages. Some portions may use Boost.</p>

<p>The mainstream of CommonKit project development is an idea that it is possible to create portable,  fast and reliable programs in C++ with no extra time or human resource expenses. It means that besides  implementation of most commonly applied mechanisms this core software package provides the way for creating  lightweight and (I have to repeat it one more time) fast and reliable source code. 	 </p>

<p>Project status: </p>

<p>The library is in process of active development and testing of its architectural concepts. Since CommonKit 0.0.2 was released (you can find its source code in branches folder) it bacame clear that some aspects of its design should be reviewed. In nearest feature CommonKit 0.1.0 is going to appear.   </p>

<p>Currently supported platforms: </p>

<p>Win32. MacOS. iPhoneOS. Note: There should be no problems with building the library under any Posix-compatible platform with g++ compiler.  </p>

<p>Dependencies: </p>

<p>Boost libraries. You have to download Boost (http://www.boost.org/) and configure your IDE and projects to point to correct location of Boost source code. Note that you do not need to build Boost from its source code. CommonKit bases only on header libraries from Boost package. Loki library. </p>

 title : The distdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>New Project!This is a brand new project, in its infancy.  We are looking for anyone interested in this technology to collaborate with us.  You can have a huge impact on this project, and make it a success! </p>

<p>IntroductionThe goal of this project is to create a database access layer that creates a virtual distributed temporal database.  We want to bring database technology associated with large complex business and science related applications into common applications.  Temporal databases, although still obscure to most of the programming world can drastically change the way programmers think about databases.  The invaluable historical information gathered in a temporal table can be used by the rest of the system to properly make decisions(such as conflicts), and also allows the integrator the ability to harness the wealth temporal information. </p>

<p>The most obvious application for such a system would be for specific client applications that rely on a central database for data to operate on.  In many cases, it is unreasonable to have to access the remote database for all operations, but instead, a local database of relevant information can be used to work on. </p>

<p>At a certain point in time(hopefully frequently) the client will synchronize its database with the central server.  Another important use of this technology is when the client does not have access to the central server.  Normal RIA applications die without internet connectivity. </p>

<p>The client and server can also communicate in a &quot;real-time&quot; mode, using a live TCP socket.  In this way(as in typical distributed systems), the client and server can update each other, minimizing conflicts. </p>

<p>With a completely stand-alone client, the user can continue to work as normal, synchronizing their changes when they have the opportunity. </p>

<p>The system must have the capability to cope with simple merging of data, and prompt the user if conflicts resolve.  With detailed historical information in each table, if multiple commits are made, the software layer can merge the changes, usually without any problems.</p>

 summary : <p>Downloading Flickr sets can be a pain, especially if you are using Flickr as a backup (with a pro account) and have a few hundred photos per set. Flickr does not on their website allow you to download the entire set, only one at a time. </p>

<p>This project is based on flickr.py, and has a GUI created in wxPython (though that is curretly in alpha). It is cross platform, and does what it is meant to do, and only that: download entire sets. Other features are planned, but all those features will be based around downloading. </p>

<p>I started this project because I wanted to be able to download entire sets of photos from Flickr, as I got a pro account for backing up my photos. Unfortuantly, flickr.py didn&#39;t allow me to authenticate so I could download private photos from my account, so I also added a authentication module to flickr.py (which is now available in the flickr.py SVN). </p>

 summary : <p>NewsIn development: a tool for scoring CNVs and runs of homozygosity using linkage results. homruns: Version 0.1.2 fixes a number of path issues that prevented homruns from working on Windows systems. homruns: Version 0.1.1 has been released, replacing 0.1 and fixing some chromosome index bugs that crashed homruns. Downloading the new version is highly recommended. This is the website for homruns, a simple GUI application for searching SNP datasets for runs of homozygosity and Mendelian errors and visualizing the results. </p>

<p>UsageBinary pedigree files (Plink bed + bim + fam format) should be used as input. The parameters that can be adjusted in the program have the same names as those for command-line use of Plink&#39;s --homozyg mode. For details of what each of them do, see the Plink manual.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>System requirementshomruns runs best on a modern linux system with python,  pygtk, and matplotlib installed, and Plink in the system path. A good package for everything except Plink on Windows is python(x,y). Make sure to get the matplotlib and gtk plugins if you download it. </p>

<p>Bugshomruns should be considered beta software, so some bugs are to be expected. If you find one, please let me know by email or the issue tracker on this site. </p>

<p>Windows, OS XRunning homruns on Windows or Mac OS X can be shaky, but should be doable. If you run into trouble setting it up on your Windows system, or get unexpected results or crashes, send me an email at robert.karlsson@ki.se and I&#39;ll do my best to help you get up and running. A stand-alone Windows version (no separate Python installation needed) is under preparation, and will be uploaded here &quot;when it&#39;s ready&quot;.</p>
 title : The hunger Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Our game is called HUNGER. It is being developed for the PC. The story of the game begins when your father, who is something like the spiritual leader of your tribe, dies suddenly. Before he is gone, however, he asks you to perform a mysterious deed - to water a dead tree in the center of the village everyday with water from the river&#39;s source, which lies far on the top of a mountain. Soon after, once your father is buried, a catastrophe happens and all the stores of food in the tribe are destroyed. Winter is approaching and the tribal leaders are worried there won&#39;t be enough food to make it through the season. They enlist every young man, including you, to hunt daily in the valley in order to build up a store of food before the first winter storm. Here the game proper starts and it is up to you to decide whether you want to fulfill the request of your dead father and water the tree everyday, or join in and hunt in the valley to save the tribe from starvation. The choice you make and the consequences which spring from it are what HUNGER is all about.</p>

 title : The jlite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionjLite is a Java library providing simple API for accessing gLite based grid infrastructure. It is intended for Java developers who struggle with gLite middleware and want to reduce time and effort needed to build a cross-platform grid application on top of the EGEE grid infrastructure. jLite also includes a command-line interface which can be used as a simple cross-platform alternative to gLite User Interface on Windows and other operating systems.  </p>

<p>Existing Java APIs for gLite are scattered among several packages and expose mostly low-level service operations. Available API usage examples often imply the presence of gLite User Interface environment installed on Scientific Linux. This complicates the use of these APIs for development of cross-platform grid applications. jLite is addressing these problems by providing a high-level Java API with functionality similar to gLite shell commands. Current implementation supports complete gLite job management lifecycle including VOMS proxy creation and delegation, transfer of job input files, job submission, job status monitoring and retrieval of job output files. Normal, collection and parametric gLite jobs are supported. The API hides complexity of underlying middleware and its configuration. jLite is easy to install because it includes all external dependencies and does not require installation of gLite User Interface. The library is pure Java and can be used on any Java-capable platform including Windows. </p>

<br/>&quot;Our Innovation your passion&quot;
<br/>Hello!! And welcome to the world&#39;s first easy to use, dumbproof and idiot proof operating system  The focus of this project are centered around these issues: Ease of use, Stabillity, Security, Compatibility, Peace of mind. </p>

<p>The Operating System will be based on Puppy Linux by barry kauler of puppulinux.com, the creator of puppy linux </p>

<p>Features of the Operating system will include: </p>

<p>1:Compatibillity with ALL current Major software and hardware  </p>

<p>2:Automatic hardware detection and configuation on boot up( just like the flawed play and play feature in windows but better and its done for you!) </p>

<p>3:automatic maintenance and repair tools that run as background processes that include S.M.A.R.T.  ,File Intergrity check for whenver you install\remove a program or after defrag ,intrusion detection system ,driver authenicator, antivirus, disk optimizer auto program\driver\system updater these applications purpose are to mantain and keep your whole system at optimal health so &quot;Bog downs&quot; , viruses , &quot;Lag&quot; and fragmentation will no longer be a issue </p>

<p>4: system file compression for smaller installs </p>

<p>5: Automatic crash and error diagnostic analysis ( basically what this means is that finally if your a office person or a normal home user you will be informed by a prompt that is simple and easy to understand explaining what went wrong in PLAIN ENGLISH for example, one error box would say  &quot;you ran out of memory, to remedy this issue please enlarge your swap file or add more ram to your system&quot; or somthing similar or like in a case like this maybe say &quot;oooops looks like we ran into some sort of a error ... ok to send error report?&quot; if its a total crash.) </p>

<p>6: peace of mind It will do so by automatic or scheduled updates if you prefer, autmomatic maintenance, housekeeping and  security so basically this computer with KOS installed will be taking of it self so your free to do other more productive\fun tasks </p>

<p>7: Simple Intutive interface for day to day use... (want to browse the internet? you would simply click on &quot;Internetbrowser&quot; make a spread sheet? just click on the icon or possibly just speak &quot;i want to go to google.com&quot; or say &quot;search for tennis&quot; </p>

<p>8: automatic crash recovery which means if you were working on somthing the data won&#39;t be lost </p>

<p>9: continuos automatic  backup and restore features which means if you accidentally deleted a important file, had a intrusion or accidentally some how altered the settings in a unfavorable way casuing malfunction, one click recovery or manual recovery will be your good luck charm  </p>

<p>10: recovery cd: if you or some natural occurnce cause major critical failure to the point of no boot, you&#39;ll be able to use this but if it&#39;s hardware based you might consider using a different computer to access our future forums </p>

<p>Well That&#39;s it for the featues and all the avilable infomation we have for the OS right now please check back and visit this page often for updates and more info </p>

<p>Thank you  and have Blessed day and  happy computing!</p>

 summary : <p>NESEMUThe unnamed NES emulator, also extremely portable. </p>

<p>Breaking News - 05/05/2009nesemu2 has begun, nesemu is on the backburner, while pceemu is right beside nesemu2 on the front burners!  nesemu2 is a complete rewrite reusing very little code, focusing on more accurate timing in the cpu, and mid-line updates on the ppu.  i decided it would be too much work to accomplish what i want to do, so the rewrite has begun.  also, there is a new gui being coded, the successor to gui2:  gui3.  portability will also be a goal, also a client/server thing for internet gaming...hopefully... </p>

<p>Latest NewsNew emulation project started, PCEEMU. </p>

<p>Previous Latest NewsPS2 support will be removed when the new PPU core is completed.  The core will most likely be too much for the PS2 to handle.  Also, when the new PPU core is put into place, I should have migrated from Matt Conte&#39;s APU to blargg&#39;s APU. </p>

<p>My motivation for working on this project is strong even with my new side project starting to roll.  Mappers are also at the bottom of my priority list because, honestly, I&#39;m just sick of writing them, tracking down hard to find games, etc... </p>

<p>Old NewsI&#39;ve been secretly working on nesemu with a mini-itx Intel Atom board, not much time to do any real work but the Wii version is now working perfectly without SDL, and some new PPU engine tweaks make less graphics emulation errors.  Dirty iNES headers are now detected, so the correct mapper is loaded now.  Small ROM database is also internal in the code, for a specific few games (notably the VRC mappers).  Splash screen, and probably other things added as well.  Finally, NSF player working great along with a more compatable HLE FDS BIOS.  Not enough work for a new release though... </p>

<p>FeaturesMega fast on all targets, around 900 FPS on this computer I am writing with. Superb compatability. Awesome mapper support. Amazingly free and open sores, released under GPL v2. Supported TargetsWin32: Finished. Linux: Near finished... OSX: Near finished... PS2: Near finished... Wii: Near finished... Linux binary releases will be discontinued, it&#39;s too easy to run &quot;make linux&quot;. OSX binaries need to be updated. </p>

<p>UsageUsage is the same on all platforms, an incomplete but usable ZSNES look alike GUI.  To get started, click Game then Load. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Browse directories on the right, files on the left.  This is accomplished by double clicking the directory you want to browse into, or &#39;..&#39; choosing to go to the previous directory. </p>

<p>If the emulator finds any usable images, they will appear on the left.  Single click a file to show its info at the bottom of the load dialog.  Double click a file to load it into the emulator and exit the GUI. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once the emulator is running the default keys are the same on all PC platforms; PS2 and Wii have nicer controls. </p>

<p>Default keys for PCs: </p>

<p>Directional Pad = Arrow Keys Start = S Select = A Button A = X Button B = Z Menu = Escape Fast Forward = 1 Disk Flip = F1 Save State = F5 Load State = F8 </p>

<p>Default keys for PS2: </p>

<p>Directional Pad = Directional Pad Start = Start Select = Select Button A = Square or Circle Button B = Cross or Triangle Menu = R 2 Move Menu Cursor = Left Analog </p>

<p>Default keys for Wii: </p>

<p>Classic controller can also be used, keys are perfect with it. Wiimote is being held sideways. Directional Pad = Directional Pad Start = + Select = - Button A = 2 Button B = 1 Disk Flip = B Menu = A Move Menu Cursor = Flip Wiimote vertically, and use point and click method with B. </p>

<p>There are many GUI options, those will be documented later, before the &#39;final&#39; release.  Just explore, there is a lot! </p>

<p>Code NotesThe emulator is coded in C, nothing fancy.  It should build under any environment.  I usually use GCC for all targets other than Windows, Visual Studio 2005 with Windows, and KDevelop on Linux. </p>

<p>PS2 NotesFeedback is needed on the PS2 port.  If the emulator ISN&#39;T working for you, please either email or post an issue containing the following information: </p>

<p>PS2 kind (either slim or fat). Which devices are in the controller ports. Memory card slot contents (memcard type and manufacturer). Ethernet controller connected? (fat ps2 only) Hard drive connected? Where NESEMU was ran from (network, hard drive, etc.). NESEMU version. </p>

<p>BugsPlease report all bugs found to the Issues section of this site. </p>

<p>Your feedback is needed to make the emulator better!</p>

 summary : <p>Office for PHP aim to be the first implementation of a cross-platform, reader/writer, dom-like based software to manage Office and OpenOffice documents with a pluggable back-end architecture that will let to developers to implement their own reader/writers and will let to users to manage their documents without be worried about the file format. </p>

<p>Main featurs of Office for PHP are: - File Format Indipendent, this will let to add or remove support for a specific file format without the need to modify the front-end code of the library, pratically it works using a plugglable back-end architecture - Cross-Platform, being written in PHP, and supported by phalanger, the library could be used in every kind of windows application using COM, COM+, .NET and PHP and over linux using MONO, when it will support corba, or PHP - DOM-Like architecture, the front-end code will be like a tree where every branch will be a specific object that could contains other branches or leafs, like a Document Object Model - BSD License, this will let to any developer to implement it without be worried about license </p>

<p>Naturally we ever looking for help in development, testing, documentation, packagers and so on.</p>

 summary : <p>One More Music Player Client...As if there aren&#39;t enough music player applications out there, I present to you one more, the aptly named One More Music Player Client.   </p>

<p>So, why do we need another front-end for mpd(the Music Player Daemon)? The answer lies in the intended audience.  Although designed to be cross platform through the use of SDL as a development toolkit, the target platform is Gamepark Holdings open source gaming and multimedia device the GP2X.  In the future the application will perhaps be fleshed out to be a viable desktop mpd client also, but the focus is currently a robust player for this gem of a console. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Someone mentioned a donate button, so here you go.  Personally I just find it cool that someone uses the player, but I&#39;m not morally opposed to money or anything. :) </p>

 title : The open-tome Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MotivationThe aim of the OpenTome project is to produce a comic book viewer that works on all major platforms, has a clean and intuitive interface and supports all the major comic book formats. </p>

<p>Project StatusOpenTome is currently pre-alpha, though an alpha release (0.0.1) will be forthcoming. The current state is perfectly usable, but not yet feature complete enought to be presented as an alpha release. </p>

<p>InstallationOpenTome requires Python (http://python.org/), Qt4 (http://trolltech.com/) and PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php). </p>

<p>Currently OpenTome is pre-alpha so installation is manual. You will need to install Python, Qt4 and PyQt4 (all of which have fairly painless installations on Windows). The first time you run OpenTome it will prompt you for some initial setup paths. </p>

<p>Features (current)Supports CBR, CBZ files, png, jpg and gif image files. Multithreaded loading of Comics - ensures that you don&#39;t ever wait for anything to load. New formats supported through a simple plugin system. Library management, browsing and searching/ Simply tagging search function for comics, automatically generated on initial load. Viewer allows scaling, rotation and double page view. Features (planned)Support for .pdf formats Conversion and editing tools for the comic book formats (reordering pages, metadata, etc.) eBook support</p>

 summary : <p>AboutPadaea is an open source and cross platform rom organizer with extensive customizability. </p>

<p>LicensePadaea is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. </p>

<p>SummaryPadaea is a game organizational tool, written in C++. It is meant to be a simple to use, and open source/cross platform, game organizer, similar to other such programs. The main difference is in the way games are organized. Instead of a single string containing the whole data entry, each entry has multiple fields and the final output (for example, the renaming of files) can be generated with as much control as possible. It has tools to import data from other formats, as well as the ability to generate data from a sequence of files. </p>

<p>FeaturesCross platform and open source Standardizes on data format that is easily put into database Separates data for game entries into fields for easier retrieval Features a simple user interface to manage games Renames games based on format codes Creates data files from a set of games and their file names Merges data files and automatically merges similar fields Updates data files from game header data Keeps track of games found versus missing ones</p>

 title : The qgetopts Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Designed to be a generic, cross-platform library that can parse  command-line formats as generally as possible (similar to getopts on Linux, but easier to use &amp; object-oriented). </p>

<p>The supported format is GNU Command-line options are position independent but emitted in the same relative position (i.e. &quot;-a -b foo -d -c boo&quot; gets emmited as &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;boo&quot; assuming none of the options accepted arguments). </p>

<p>Both long (multi-character options preceded by &quot;--&quot;) and short mode (options preceded by &quot;-&quot; and 1 character long) are supported. </p>

<p>Command-line option arguments (arguments that are specific to long/short option) can be optional, any number from 1 to 2^31 - 1, or variable.  Arguments however must be given as a single command-line parameter (in the case of short options, the can be merged along with the short option as shown below).  The API takes care of splitting up the arguments for you. </p>

<p>Short option arguments can be given as &quot;-aarg1,,arg3&quot; (arg1, empty string, arg3 as arguments) or &quot;-aarg1 arg2 arg3&quot;, or &quot;-a&quot; &quot;arg1,arg2,arg3&quot;.  Separators for multi-argument options can be whatever you specify. </p>

<p>All remaining command-line parameters that are not options, or arguments to options, are retrieved separately and maintain their relative order (i.e. take the original parameters and remove all options &amp; option arguments). </p>

<p>Optionally, it can serialize a pretty &amp; complete help menu (and handle the help command line arguments for you) into a string or some kind of output stream. </p>

<p>The library is Qt based, but currently does expose a primitive standard C++ interface.  QtCore headers are needed for compilation, but not the Qt libraries (assuming it is statically linked). </p>

<p>Eventually this will be split into two libraries - CPPGetOpts which has all the logic in a cross-platform C++ library (with no external dependancies) and QGetOpts which will be the Qt wrapper interface.</p>

 summary : <p>Quokka3D is a cross-platform, lightweight software-only 3D polygon rendering engine written in C++. </p>

<p>It is a C++ port of the 3D engine described in the book &quot;Developing Games in Java&quot; by David Brackeen. The engine features texture mapping, light mapping, BSP trees (2D only currently, like Doom), basic OBJ file parsing, basic collision detection and basic 3D animation. It uses standard C++ and is designed to be cross-platform. To achieve this the engine uses other open source libraries to abstract away the underlying hardware. Currently PixelToaster is used as the output framebuffer and OIS to control input devices.  </p>

<p>Please note there is no 3D hardware acceleration in this engine - it is purely a software engine. </p>

<p>You can write simple 3D games or simulations with Quokka3D, or use it as a learning tool for 3D graphics. </p>

<p>1. Although there have been recent improvements, by and large most Word Processors focus more on highly situational functionality than on usability and maximizing productivity </p>

<p>2. Most monitors sold today are in some sort of wide screen aspect ratio (Generally 16:10), which has a greater horizontal space. Without exception that I am aware of, there are no existing Word Processors that make effective use of horizontal space, with all of them instead orienting their layouts vertically. </p>

<p>It is these weaknesses that I intend to focus on addressing with this application.</p>

 summary : <p>SceneMLSceneML is a simple 3D scene creation and management tool and also provides fast and accurate collision queries. Currently, collision calculations are provided by the Open Dynamics Engine. It also supports a mex interface for easy use inside Matlab. </p>

<p>Basic descriptionSceneML is a simple 3D scene creation and management tool with its ultimate purpose being a collision query tool. 3D scenes are described in a straight forward XML format. For instance: </p>

<p>		
<br/>

<br/>			
<br/>		
<br/>	
<br/>SceneML supports virtually every primitive geometry supported by ODE (e.g. boxes, spheres, capsules, etc) as well as arbitrary user-defined meshes specified in either OBJ or STL file formats. The XML scene format also allows for variable parameters which can be modified after the scene is loaded from file. Anytime a variable parameter is modified, SceneML can recompute the position and orientation of all bodies which are impacted by the change of that parameter. Here is an example of a variable rotation being specified: </p>

<p>Bodies and geometries are lumped together into &quot;spaces&quot;. The user can also specify which spaces the library should check for inter-collisions. For example: </p>

 title : The shell-x Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In computing, a shell is a piece of software that essentially provides a kind of interface for end-users. Examples include the various Unix shells (sh, ksh, csh, tcsh, bash, etc.), DOS&#39;s command.com (&#39;Command Prompt&#39;) etc.</p>

<p>A detailed comparison of shells which use the command line to serve their purpose, shows that it is quite difficult for novice computer user to remember the commands for different shells, if the user has never worked in that environment (OS).</p>

<p>Shell-X aims to deliver a better solution that would have the same commands and features across all operating systems. To achieve this we require technologies that are platform independent where java is the obvious choice.</p>

<p>Thus, the project is named Shell-X where &#39;X&#39; stands for cross platform.</p>

<p>The AirLogger AS3 client is already available in LowRA or   in a stand alone class in the download section, AS2 and haXe version will come soon. </p>

<p>AirLogger needs that you have installed the AIR runtime. </p>

<p>Here a screenshot of the AirLogger Window :  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FeaturesAirLogger offers many advantages, compared with other consoles: </p>

<p>Possibility to log several messages from several files at the same time. Each file is displayed in a separate tabs with its own filtering. Tabs can be named from the file sending the messages and renamed any time. Full HTML display: astounding performances compared with the same Flash functions. What’s more, an HTML page gives the possibility to select a whole text on the screen (not yet available with Flash) and to insert images in a text. Messages can be received even if an AirLogger instance is not opened. Messages are gathered on the emitter’s file and sent as soon as the connection with AirLogger is effective. 2 types of message-filtering : a narrowing type (all messages of lower level than the current level are ignored) and an equality type (all messages that are not current are ignored) Logs search, with a search bar equivalent to the one on Firefox, that is to say real-time search, highlighted results… Recursive treatment of the logs with systems giving prominence to particular information (color codes or web and mail addresses) Concerning AS3 files, the tabs corresponding to a file can be selected as soon as the focus is received (thanks to the Event.ACTIVATE event). Handles common LocalConnection issue (persistent connection, even if the file have been closed). AirLogger is supported by Prizee.com</p>

 summary : <p>Logging system for ActionScript 3 for different publishersThis logger system is inspired by the concept of Zeroi AS2. You can output the logs on different publishers, e.g. SOS, a simple TextField or maybe your own output system. </p>

<p>All methods are static, so no instantiation is required. </p>

<p>The aim of this logger is too keep the usage as simple as possible. </p>

<p>To develop your own publisher, just implement the IPublisher interface. </p>

<p>ExamplesSimple example for TextFieldPublisher: </p>

<p>var field : TextField = TextFieldPublisher.getLoggerField();
<br/>addChild( field );</p>

<p>Logger.publisher = new TextFieldPublisher( field );</p>

<p>Logger.info( &quot;It works&quot; );

<p>Logger.publisher = new SOSPublisher;</p>

<p>Logger.info( &quot;It works&quot; );
<br/>Logger.debug( &quot;Some debug output&quot; , 15 , [1, 2, 3] );Combined publisher: </p>

<p>var field : TextField = TextFieldPublisher.getLoggerField();
<br/>addChild( field );</p>

<p>Logger.publisher = new TextFieldPublisher( field );
<br/>Logger.addPublisher( new SOSPublisher );</p>

<p>// or use the MultiPublisher: Logger.publisher = new MultiPublisher( [ new TextFieldPublisher( field ) , new SOSPublisher ] );</p>

<p>Logger.info( &quot;It works&quot; );

 summary : <p>Cuelib is a java library for manipulating cue sheets. </p>

<p>You can use cuelib to... </p>

<p>Create an internal representation of a cue sheet, either from scratch or by parsing an existing one. The parser is designed to be very tolerant for maximum compatibility, but it will raise a warning for any deviation of the spec that it detects, helping you to fix problems. Manipulate the internal representation to read specific data, or to make changes. Turn the representation back into a cue sheet. Convert the representation into XML so you can use your XML tools to process it. You can easily convert it back to a cue sheet with the XSLT we provide. Cut up files into track-sized bits and (optionally) post-process these. You can use this functionality to easily create mp3 files (with ID3 tags based on the cue sheet) from wav files. Support for tracks hidden in pregaps is included. More features are planned. </p>

<p>Besides the fields originally specified for cue sheets, cuelib also supports the extra fields used by Exact Audio Copy. </p>

<p>Cuelib requires java SE 1.5 or higher, and is released under version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser Public License. Feel free to check out the source code. You may change the code and you may redistribute it with or without your changes, as long as you comply with the license. You don&#39;t need to ask for permission. </p>

 title : The expect4j Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A powerful feature of Tcl has always been its integration with the Expect library (http://expect.nist.gov).  As Tcl has been ported to the Java platform (http://tcljava.sourceforge.net/) certain C-based libraries have been left behind. Expect4j is an attempt to rewrite Expect in Java and provide bindings to the TclJava interpreter.  The goal is to be able to port existing Tcl code bases that use Expect directly to Java without changes.  The current version has successfully run a 10,000 line Tcl script which heavily depends on Expect for it operation. </p>

<p>Expect is the kitchen sink of IO control.  It supports control of processes and sockets, and a complex method of match multiple patterns at the same time.  These are needed in some applications, but it complicates the API a tad. Especially when it used in Java which doesn&#39;t support closures natively.  There are other libraries which offer a more concise API, e.g. enchanter (http://code.google.com/p/enchanter/).  enchanter is a very good library and it is highly recommended for automating ssh/telnet sessions.  But when Expect syntax is needed, Expect4j is the way to go.</p>

 title : The javagems Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Java GemsJava Gems are general purpose utilities for Java. Yes, Java Gems are those simple code snippets copied again and again from one project to another, often from your private project to several work projects, those things too small for own library you cannot find in java.util and its subpackages, but you cannot live without them. </p>

<p>News2009/11/03 - The version 2009.11 was released. 2009/02/11 - The version 2009.02 was released. 2009/01/11 - The version 2009.01 was released 2008/11/11 - The version 2008.11 was released. 2008/08/11 - The version 2008.08 was released. This was the first release ever. MissionAn usual Java project has a lot of dependencies on 3rd party libraries. Managing them sometimes turns into a nightmare. Tools for dependency management exist, but unfortunately, their black magic sometime causes more problems than it solves. Surprisingly often we can found a 3rd party library with only a single simple feature used in a project. Java Gems has intention to provide as many of those simple functions as possible in the only one library. </p>

<p>It is not intended to replace all Java libraries ever made, especially huge stable and widely spread frameworks. Java Gems is intended to remove common code from them and make them available as well designed, documented and testet building blocks. Yep, some single-package libraries can be reimplemented or merged. A cycle can appear here: if a significant amount of a library is moved to Java Gems, the library will become simple, and it can be merged to or reimplemented in Java Gems subsequently. In fact, the main goal is to provide Java developers a way how to share tools and utilities without a necessity to reinvent them in each project or when moving to another team or changing a job. </p>

<p>A 3rd party libraries usage in a project can vary a lot. I know about projects which do not use 3r party libraries at all and also I know projects where huge amount of 3rd party libraries management takes a significant portion of developers&#39; working time. Just a rough example: Let&#39;s say that J2SE libraries now covers 50% of a project functionality (part A), 30% is covered by N 3rd party libraries (part B) and resting 20% is project own code (part C). Goals of Java Gems are to reduce the number N in the part B and to reduce a portion of the part C.  </p>

<p>Many 3rd party libraries are dead now. Unfortunately, have to say. They were implemented by a few passionate people - very often by only one person - for their purpose, they were maintained for a while, but abandoned later for many reasons. Many of them are frozen in Java 1.4 times, lacking all those cool Java 5 features like generics or varargs. Java Gems want to be a living library for living projects. We will design our interfaces very carefully and with extensions and changes in mind, but we will not hesitate to make things @Deprecated and even remove them later.  </p>

<p>ContributionSend your feedback to gems.for.java@gmail.com. But, even better... ... send your code to gems.for.java@gmail.com. Before you do so, check Contributing Recommendations below.  What will be done with code you submit?Code will be refused completely. Very unlikely, if you at least tried to satisfy Contributing recommendations written below.  Code will be accepted as is. Very unlikely, even if you tried to satisfy Contributing recommendations written below as much as possible.  Something in-between. Very likely. Your code might be refactored, documentation might be improved and design might be changed. Or in the first round, you will be asked to do so, with explanation why it is considered to be important. Maybe only your idea will be adopted and completely new implementation will be provided. Contributing RecommendationsCode should be common enough. Often used features and reausable tools gathering is a main aim of Java Gems project. Single class utilities are perfect; single package utilities might be accepted. Dependency only on Java 6 libraries and current release of Java Gems is allowed. Code should be fully portable, i.e. written in pure Java. No JNI, please.  Good documentation on all levels. Explain, why your code should be merged. Explain, what it provides. Explain, how it works.  Current J2SE code should not be duplicated even if there is very good reason for that.

 summary : <p>JLogMicro intends to be a logging framework for J2ME (Java ME)(Phone ME) with GPL license.  The other frameworks are good (Microlog) but cannot be used with GPL if a class is extended in such a way that it adds functionality to the superclass.  The intent is to implement a form of Java logging framework.  Currently this is of alpha quality.  The console handler and form handler work well.  The record store handler needs more work as it logs, but does not enforce the limit.  The file handler is practically unusable due to the way the J2ME VM works.  The VM forces the user to accept writing to the file system for every so many bytes which makes it unusable on most VM&#39;s (including the emulators).</p>

<p>what is itMLAPD manages electronic mail lists posting accesses. Its goal is to read this kind of data from an LDAP server. It works as an Access Policy Delegation agent for Postfix, so it listens on a TCP socket and can be concurrently by multiple Postfix instances! </p>

<p>how it worksMLAPD is written in Python and it&#39;s supposed to offer good performances under heavy loads, because it listens on a multithreaded TCP socket and does not need to be spawned as a Postfix Content Filter every time. </p>

<p>MLAPD requires you to have installed only the standard Python library plus the Python-LDAP module, so it shouldn&#39;t be too invasive in your system(s). </p>

<p>detailsThe TCP server of MLAPD, which parses protocol data from Postfix&#39;s connections and gives it back actions, is independent from the datasource, so an SQL modeler (or whatever other data modeler) could in theory be implemented reusing the same MLAPD core. </p>

<p>You can find more deployment details and notes about the integration of MLAPD with third party applications in the wiki, or using the links on your right! (yes, the googlecode&#39;s layout isn&#39;t that flexible and comfortable after all) </p>

<p>A lot of momentum exists to use the OSGi Service Platform for the foundation and runtime platform for enterprise Java applications. Well-known vendors in the JavaEE space are building their work on top of the OSGi framework. Additionally, more and more projects and technologies are using the OSGi programming model and component architecture. Bundles are becoming the universal deployment artifact and the service registry is used for SOA, web services and even event-based communication. </p>

<p>The goal of ModuleFusion is to help programmers to use the OSGi Service Platform as their underlying runtime environment. ModuleFusion contains a full stack typical for Java enterprise applications. This stack currently consists of best-of-breed open source frameworks from the Java ecosystem. Additionally, ModuleFusion contains the necessary glue code to easily use these frameworks within OSGi. </p>

<p>Probably the most important principle of ModuleFusion is to base every integration, glue code and additional functionality on pure OSGi constructs. Therefore, ModuleFusion does not rely on proprietary features offered by some OSGi framework implementations.  </p>

<p>Also, ModuleFusion shows that it is possible to build full-fledged Java enterprise applications with OSGi now. </p>

 title : The mooperformanceassessment Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionReal-world optimization problems most often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. Thus, the development of efficient multi-objective optimizers has become more and more popular lately and a lot of different approaches ranging from quite simple search heuristics to sophisticated evolutionary algorithms are currently known. </p>

<p>Consider a scientists or engineer that has just prototyped a new approach for solving multi-objective optimization problems. Of course, she wants to know whether her own method performs better or worse than those already available, i.e., she needs to assess the performance of her system. </p>

<p>The framework presented here targets the engineer and/or scientists who wants to empirically compare multi-objective optimizers. It is heavily inspired by the performance assessment module of PISA but tries to address some of its main issues that I have had by choosing an object-oriented approach. </p>

<p>Design Principles &amp; IdeasIn general each important core function of the system is abstracted by the definition of an interface: </p>

<p>IClass: Each interface implements this interface, that just consists of one method QString name(). IDataSetReader: This interface abstracts loading of &#39;raw&#39; objective vectors from any kind of data source, i.e. later on the processing of remote resources or resource bundles might be an interesting an option. Currently a fairly simple implementation just loading a file containing the data is available.  IFileNameAssembler:  IUnaryQualityIndicator: A unary quality indicator assigns a real number to a set of m-dimensional objective vectors. IBinaryQualityIndicator: A binary quality indicator assigns a real number to two sets of m-dimensional objective vectors. Currently the additive epsilon indicator is implemented and will shortly be followed by an implementation of the hyper volume indicator. IStatisticalSignificanceTest: An interface that allows for different statistical tests. Implementations of this interface are used to verify that differences in (binary) indicator values are significant.  IPostProcessor: A high-level interface that allows for the post-processing of assessment data (e.g. indicator values, significance levels), like plot generation, LaTeX-code generation etc.. </p>

<p>Please note, that this is currently a playground for my ideas regarding the framework mentioned above. For this reason, the software has to be considered ALPHA :-) So be prepared for quite faulty and unreliable system :-) Of course, if you are willing to help or assist in completing the framework, or have any questions, just drop me a mail at thomas.voss.bochum@googlemail.com</p>

 summary : <p>Mouzetrap aims to fill a niche of multi-threaded server software for the 21st century.  Most multi-threaded software nowadays relies on synchronization by locking, a process that is inefficient and doesn&#39;t make the best use of today&#39;s multi-core processors. By using simple, effective, and proven wait-free/lock-free data structures and algorithms, that performance can be reclaimed. Mouzetrap will provide everything needed for the nitty gritty layers of the software: object pooling, threading, and networking.</p>

 title : The nwrapper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NWrapper is a library which implements a standard API around third-party libraries, in an effort to standardize, integrate, and enhance functionality. </p>

<p>Its roots started with WilsonORWrapper, a code library built around Paul Wilson&#39;s O/R Mapper (http://code.google.com/p/wilsonormapper/). As time went on, we realized we could extend the functionality of the wrapper and get it to work over a larger set of libraries -- and NWrapper was born. </p>

<p>NWrapper is in the early alpha/proof of concept stage of development, but the goal is to provide the following: </p>

<p> A standard logging interface that can log to an underlying logging system (system event log, ASP.Net trace log, NLog, log4net, etc.).  A standard cache interface that can cache to an underlying cache system (ASP.Net cache, memcached, etc.).  A standard data mapper interface that can support multiple O/R mapper instances and/or types (Wilson O/R Mapper, NPersist, etc.) and automatically use the proper underlying mapper for a given entity.  A support layer providing useful base classes for entity objects and other methods.  An open system where you can write your own logger, cache, or data mapper providers and plug them into the system.  Simple and flexible configuration, initialization, and usage. </p>

<p>Further, we look to incorporate the following: </p>

<p> Transparent data mapper caching -- even if the underlying mapper doesn&#39;t support it.  The ability to query across different O/R mappers using a universal query object.  Full LINQ support.</p>

 title : The slf4fx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SLF4Fxis the opensource framework that allows to integrate Flex logging API on client side with many java logging frameworks on server side. </p>

<p>The idea behind is simple. On client side we have LoggingTarget that sends all log records to slf4fx server written on java. The server utilizes Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) for routing all incoming records to supported java logging framework. The list of supported frameworks includes all well-known logging frameworks. They provide many ways for further log manipulations - filtering, saving to file, writing to console, sending to email ant etc. There are also many UI and text based tools for log analysis that works with those logging frameworks. </p>

<p>SLF4Fx uses very simple but efficient binary protocol to transfer log records between flex client and java server.  The framework also provides ability to collect log records from particular client application instance that could be useful on remote support. </p>

<p>In development you can use provided simple sl4fx server or you can integrate the slf4fx server bean into your own java application with just few lines of code. </p>

<p>See Integration page for futher details or you can start using SLF4Fx with FourSimpleStepsToStart. </p>

<p>StatusCurrent stable version is 1.12 (no fixes, no improvements, maven repository were added) </p>

 title : The wilsonormapper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WilsonORMapper is the open source release of Paul Wilson&#39;s O/R Mapper. It is lightweight, powerful, and easy-to-use. </p>

<p>Originally hosted at http://www.ormapper.net, the open source release was made official on Sept 9 2007 by Paul Wilson (read his announcement), as of version 4.2.2.0. </p>

<p>.NET v2.0 SupportSupports both Generics and Nullable Types with the .NET v2.0 Build. Database SupportSupports MS Sql, Access, Oracle, as well as generic OleDb and Odbc. Define your own CustomProvider for any Database without Recompile: MySql, PostgreSql, Sqlite, Firebird, DB2, VistaDB, Sybase, etc. Retrieve individual objects by key -- auto, guids, and user-entered. Use auto key-types with Oracle 9+ by setting trigger with sequence. Composite keys supported, even with relations and stored procs. Supports one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships. Supports outer joins to populate lookup values in a single query. Supports optional lazy-loading to minimize reads from the database. Supports optional default sort orders that are always overridable. Supports optional field default null-values -- thanks to Tim Byng. Even use null-value expressions like MinValue -- thanks to Jeff Lanning. Use any raw sql statement with GetDataSet or ExecuteCommand. Retrieval SupportRetrieve individual objects by primary key, often from internal cache. Retrieve collections as a static ObjectSet or a cursor ObjectReader. GetCollection returns strongly typed collections -- thanks to Allan Ritchie. Retrieve DataSets, optionally specifying a specific subset of fields. Query with any where and sort clauses -- use sql or the QueryHelper. Build simple expressions with an OPath-like syntax using the QueryHelper. Includes nearly complete OPath query engine -- thanks to Jeff Lanning. Supports paged collections -- queries can specify page index and size. Can optionally use stored procedures with parameter for any retrieval. Performance is very much comparable, sometimes better, than DataSets. Support for Typed Datasets which some Reporting Packages Require.  Persistence SupportExplicitly create objects with new and StartTracking, or use GetObject. Persist individual objects, or a collection of objects in transaction. Control your own Transaction object with BeginTransaction method. Interact with the Transaction in the IObjectNotification events. Thanks to Ken Muse for recursive persistence and cascading delete help. Recursively persist all related child changes with PersistDepth.ObjectGraph. Optionally enable cascading deletes on any relation in the xml mappings. User can define fields for optimistic concurrency, or read-only fields. Updates can optionally be only the changes, with or without concurrency. Execute set based updates and deletes, including update set expressions. Persistence is done with safe and efficient parameterized dynamic sql, although stored procedures can optionally be configured for persistence. Supports optional before and after event notification for persistence. Simple ArchitectureNo need to inherit objects from a base class or embed any attributes. Map either member fields or properties, with reflection or interface. Object-relational mappings are made in one or more simple xml files. Optionally use embedded resources for mappings -- thanks to Allan Ritchie. Support class hierarchies and simple mapping inheritance by Jerry Shea. Also supports &quot;shared inheritance&quot; in the database using type discriminator. Optionally intercept database commands for logging or even modifications. Includes a Windows ORHelper to generate the mapping and class files. Also includes CodeSmith Templates from Paul Welter for code generation. Collections support one-way read-only binding for both Web and Windows. Separate instances can be created for multiple databases or providers. Easy to deploy with simple x-copy in shared web hosting environments. Supports medium-trust when mapping to public members (or reflection). Includes full C# source code, as well as the rest of WilsonDotNet.com.</p>

 summary : <p>The main idea of Zeroi is to be able to use any logging system (e.g. SOS, XRay, Luminic Box, XTrace) in your MTASC project, without having to change the code of your app. In fact your code doesn’t even need to know about Zeroi. Inside your app you only use trace statements. The traces are forwarded to the logging system of your choice. </p>

<p>That’s what the name Zeroi is standing for: Zero Impact. </p>

<p>Zeroi supports loglevels and an optional LoggerConfig XML file to set special log levels for classes and packages.</p>

 summary : <p>Maemo Mapper is a map browsing/GPS navigation software developed for Nokia internet tablet, on Maemo platform. </p>

<p>See Maemao Mapper&#39;s home page http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/ </p>

<p>and Maemo linux platform home page http://maemo.org/ </p>

<p>This project is to develop a collection of Windows PC software utilities to help build/update the map repository for Maemo Mapper. </p>

<p>The software application currently under development:A new Maemo Mapper file system that overcomes the problems in MM1.x(XYZ) and MM2.x(GDBM) file system. Not quite happy with neither MM1.x nor MM2.x map repository format, I decided to write my own one. It went on and off for more than a month, now it&#39;s basically done. BTW I ported MM1.4.7 to os2008 during the process, what an achievement! This is the first time I did coding on Linux platform, kind of brainstorming, lots of pain and fun as well. 
<br/>The new map repository format is very similar to MM1.x one, but instead of storing one map tile in one file, the new system stores up to 8 map tiles in one file(the number can be changed, very scalable). In this way the disk file space is reduced significantly but the access speed is not compromised. 
<br/>Compared with MM1.x repository format: The waste disk space is reduced to about 1/10 of the original MM1.x format, but access speed maintains the same or even faster(since it can read up to 8 map tiles at one time). Typically MM1.x system requires about 400-500MB disk space to store about 100MB map tiles on a SD card(32k allocation unit for SDHC card). Well the new map repository needs only about 120-130MB disk space. 
<br/>Compared with MM2.x repository format: The access speed is greatly enhanced. Also the new format removes the 2G byte limit on a GDBM dbase file. The map repository size is limited only by the SD card capacity. 
<br/>To demonstrate the new map repository file system, I modified the MM2.2 and MM1.4.7, made them available for both os2006-2007 and os2008 platforms. To port MM1.4.7 to os2008, the internet utility library is changed from osso-ic to conic. Now you have the Maemo Mapper 1.x and 2.x working on all platforms, and they have the same map file system. The new repository uses similar file structure as original MM1.4.7(z/x/y), but the map tile file name is changed from .jpg to .map, also changed is the numbering for directories and files. Their numbers are not 1-to-1 match with the original repository. 
<br/>You can go to the download page to get modified Maemo Mapper executables.
<br/>The new software will not change or erase anything of the original data and setup parameters, except it will create a directory in MM2.x card to store the map tiles. In MM1.x the POI icon may not work since the icon directory is changed to the same as the MM2.x structure, the icon files locate in the same directory of poi.db. 
<br/>The MM2.2 Mod 1 includes all the features up to official MM2.3.1 release, removed parts are GDBM file system and in-memory cache. I found there is not much difference in speed between MM2.3.1 and M2.2 Mod, due to improved access time of the new file system. So the in-memory cache needs not to be implemented, however the new file system does use about 3M byte as the in-memory cache. To change from your official MM2.x to the Mod version, all your data on your SD card will be kept untouched. A new directory similar to M1.xx file structure will be created to store the map repository. It&#39;s recommended to backup your GDBM file on PC and delete it from the SD card to save the disk space. 
<br/>The MM1.4 Mod 1 includes all the features up to official MM1.4.7 release, only file format is changed. Note that for os2006-os2007 version, the old osso-ic internet library is still used to keep backward compatibility, in os2008 version it uses the new conic library. But you actually can compile the os2008 version source code on os2006-os2007 platofrm, it works as well. The Mod version also changes the POI directory(POI icon directory), now the POI directory has a consistant location for both MM1.4 or MM2.x Mod versions. To change from your MM1.4.7 to the Mod version, it&#39;s suggested to backup your files to PC and delete your old map repository. The new file system will not erase any of your data but they will mix up with the original MM1.x file system, since they&#39;re quite similar. 
<br/>A GUI based windows application that views and manages the map repository. The software application developed:IEMapper: a tool that extracts the map tiles from MS IE cache to build/update Maemo Mapper 1.xx map repository Wingdbm3: a Windows routine library ported from Unix/Linux GDBM library 1.8.3 Map2gdbm: a tool that converts the map repository from Maemo Mapper 1.xx format to 2.xx GDBM map database file</p>

But in reality the whole &quot;Paper, Scissors, Rock&quot;-deal is just my own personal exploration of programming languages, operating systems and handheld devices. Before this project, PSR games in Java, PHP, Python and JavaScript had been written, the sources for these are possibly long gone. </p>

<p>Now almost a year after the latest PSR4DS release I&#39;ve decided that this project on Google Code will host the code for my future explorations, quite possibly starting with a PSR game for the Nokia N800 internet tablet (or Maemo 4.X devices in general, but a N800 is what I&#39;m expecting in the mail). </p>

<p>Paper, Scissors, Rock 4DS </p>

<p>PSR4DS is developed using the C library PAlib and devkitPro. Releases are tested in the latest versions of DeSmuME and on a Nintendo DS Lite with an R4DS cart. Best results are achieved on the actual DS Lite, some things doesn&#39;t even work in emulators :/</p>

<br/>(fcsh)Why?If you do flex development outside Flex Builder (very likely if you use Linux, as the official Flex Builder is quite buggy there), using the command line mxmlc is a painfully sloooooow. </p>

<p>Fortunately, Adobe released a tool called the Flex Compiler Shell, abbreviated as fcsh, which speeds up the compilation time considerably. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, fcsh doesn&#39;t work well when you want to integrate fcsh with the common build toolchains, where the compiler is expected to compile the source and exit (with at least a non-zero exit code if the compilation failed, of course). </p>

<p>Here is a simple solution to the problem: &quot;The Flex Compiler Shell Daemon&quot;, or fcshd for short. It basically wraps the fcsh in a daemonized process, and calls that server process when you invoke it from the command line. The daemon is automatically started the first time you use fcshd, of course. </p>

<p>Bottom line: You get fast compilation and familiar interface, easy to integrate to build tools like rake, or text editor plugins such as Emacs/Flymake. </p>

<p>InstallationJust copy fcshd.py into a directory which is in on your PATH</p>

<br/>There are a number of other places &#39;round the net where one can talk about Mapbook, most notably the ESRI support forums. As the &quot;DS MapBook - New Version&quot; thread amply demonstrates the forum structure there does not support the level of discussion this tool generates (also see MapbookPopularity). Perhaps using a google group instead will be more useful to folks. So let&#39;s try it out and see what happens.

<p>World of Warcraft addon: Multi-bar mod that automatically adds potions, water, food, quest and other items you specify into buttons for easy use. </p>

<p>Does not use up action slots. You can create your own categories of items, dragging items from bags, or spells from spell books into it. You can make custom Buttons that contain 1 or more Custom or Built in categories. You can create custom Bars to organize your Buttons to suit your interface needs. WoW has thousands of items you may obtain.  AutoBar automatically organizes frequently used items for you, saving you the drudgery of dragging stuff from your bags to an action bar.  Since AutoBar does not use up the limited action slots available, you can save those for your spells and abilities. </p>

 summary : <p>DjVu has become a standard among research institutions for displaying and archiving scanned documents. There are free OCR utilities on the web that can help you transcribe the contents of thousands of paper documents. However, these OCR tools leave much to be desired, as many OCR tools do. This project will create a wiki based on 1) a collection of scanned documents converted to DjVu format, and 2) the corresponding OCR text for those documents. The idea is that people and researchers can improve on the quality of the OCR transcription by correcting mistakes. Eventually, the system should be able to learn from often-repeated corrections and suggest or automatically replace OCR mistakes. We will use a 19th Century Dictionary of Slang as the content basis for this wiki.</p>

 title : The htc-flasher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HTCFlasher -formerly known as HERMflasher- is an open source tool which allows you to flash ROMs on most current HTC devices. It has some extra features that the original HTC RUU doesn&#39;t have, like for example it can present a serial prompt to the bootloader (replacing mtty). </p>

<p>YANG is Yet Another NBH Generator. A tool that allows you to generate custom NBH files out of ROM parts (.nb) files. You can choose the CID, ModelID, Language, etc. and also adjust the NBH signature size, thus making valid NBHs for all HTC devices. You need a way to flash custom/cooked ROMs (ie: HardSPL, USPL, SSPL, JumpSPL, etc...) to flash NBH files generated with YANG. YANG can also dump NBH file contents (.nb ROM parts), this is a command line replacement for windows tools like nbhextract or htcrt. </p>

<p>nbimg is a tool to convert NB splash screens to BMP images, it can also do the reverse, convert BMP images to NB splash screens. It can work with any resolution, and supports HTC PocketPC and Smartphone splash screen formats. This tool is command line only, I have not written a GUI for it yet. </p>

<p>Linux ROM Kitchen is a tool that allows you to cook your own Windows Mobile ROMs for HTC Windows Mobile devices. This means you can extract the contents of a Shipped or Dumped ROM, and add/remove files or Packages into the ROM.  </p>

 title : The jdpf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Java Data Processing Framework (JDPF) helps you in the definition, generation and execution of standard and custom data processing. JDPF has been designed to be modular and estendable. For these reasons, we decided to implement it in Java™ through OSGi technology which provides a service-oriented, component-based environment for developers and offers standardized ways to manage the software lifecycle. </p>

<p>You can use JDPF for defining your own data analysis procedure reusing already provided modules or developing your own solutions. Briefly, the data processing is performed by &#39;components&#39; (or nets) that are composed by a pipeline of reusable &#39;modules&#39; (or blocks). Modules are developed on the top of the JDPF framework. Data flow through the pipeline embedded in suitable data types.  </p>

<p>JDPF is an open source project, currently developed and maintained by a small group of people. As our hope is to be able to evolve into a wider community, we welcome collaborations/contributions of all types.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutJoyOS is an embedded operation system written for the Happyboard (an AVR-based controller board originally designed for the MIT 6.270 robotics competition). It consists of a kernel and several libraries useful for the board, general robotics, and the competition. </p>

<p>NewsJanuary 14, 2008The initial 6.270 2008 version of JoyOS (v0.2.0) was released today. Go get it from the downloads page. </p>

<p>January 5, 2008Hello! As you may note, this site is filled with holes as we add content. This project is designed specifically to support the 6.270 competition over at MIT, but has been open sourced for anyone to use but requires a Happyboard. Unfortunately this is not a commercially-available board and while I would like to extend this project to a wider set of platforms, I don&#39;t have any plans to do so in the near future. </p>

<p>For those of you interested in the latest build, please check out our source page. You can also find periodic builds at the downloads page as we release new versions. We&#39;re also putting together several wiki pages to augment the API documentation. </p>

 title : The mgwiki Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Magnesium Wiki (MgWiki) is written in Python and built upon Mercurial&#39;s versioned distributed atomic file system.</p>

<p>The aim is to create a _very_ light wiki that can run locally in low-end machines, remotely on servers, and merge contents among all users. If the machine can run Python and Mercurial, it can run MgWiki.</p>

<p>It should be useful, for instance, to maintain local versioned notes, to distribute tasks to be finished locally and to manage merging of contents.</p>

<p>At the moment, no proprietary syntax is being designed. Arbitrary HTML is accepted, and tinymce is being used as an embedded WYSIWYG HTML editor.</p>

<p>References:
<br/>[1] Mercurial: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ (GPL)
<br/>[2] Wiki: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiPrinciples
<br/>[3] TinyMCE: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ (LGPL)</p>

<p>INSTALL:
<br/>1. Do, in folder A, &#39;svn checkout http://mgwiki.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mgwiki&#39;.
<br/>2. Be sure to have Python and Mercurial correctly installed.
<br/>3. (optional) Download TinyMCE and extract it to A/mgwiki/_META/tinymce in order to enable wysiwyg edition of HTML inside MgWiki.
<br/>OBS: If you are using Windows, you should install Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) and run mgwikid inside the Cygwin bash shell. For details, look here: http://code.google.com/p/mgwiki/issues/detail?id=3&amp;can=2</p>

<p>USE:
<br/>1. Start mgwikid [port (default=8000)].
<br/>2. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000 or replace 8000 by your chosen port number.
<br/>3. When editing a page, putting brackets [] around words make them active links to new pages inside the wiki. Do not use spaces inside [].</p>

<p>ISSUES:
<br/>If something doesn&#39;t work, please have a look at the knowledge base at http://code.google.com/p/mgwiki/issues/list and fill a new issue if it is a problem not listed there. I&#39;ll answer it as soon as possible.</p>

 title : The moosphere Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>mooSphere is javascript class built on the mootools framework that provides an easy to use and powerful color picker that can be easily added into other applications. </p>

<p>mooSphere is designed to work on the 1.11 version of mooTools and is not currently compatible with the 1.2 beta versions. Either before or shortly after the stable release of 1.2 (depending on how much time I have), this project will be moving to the new design of mooTools 1.2. The last 1.11 compatible version will continue be available for download, but I will not be supporting it. </p>

<p>Note: I have been taking a break from development on this project as I have had to spend some time with personal issues. Development will resume (with a new major version release shortly thereafter). Thank you for your patience and enjoy the tool in the meantime.</p>

 title : The mpdwebamp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MPD WebAMP is an asynchronous web client for Music Player Daemon in the style of a desktop application, such as Totem or Windows Media Player.  It&#39;s target is both a modern desktop/laptop as well as lower powered web devices, primarily the Pepper Pad 2.  It offers: </p>

<p>Browsing of music library by folder structure.  Playlist manipulation, saving and loading. Playback controls, volume, seek and live status display. Album art and lyrics for currently playing song. Search: Quick search by file name or search by tags. Themes: supports theming with custom css files Sessions: Resume from where you left off. Completely Asynchronous interface. </p>

<p>Credits: CSS list item styles for songs taken from NeoMPC, a very nice MPD web client made for PDAs. </p>

<p>Built upon the TurboGears framework, utilizing python for the web server and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JSON for the page itself (no plug-ins required for clients).  Python and TurboGears are required to run the web server.   </p>

<p>NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IE 6!  This is project requires a browser with proper css support.  Firefox is the recomended browser, although any standards compliant browser should work as well.   </p>

<p>This is not only my first Open Source project, but my first attempt at web programming.  Any advice or constructive criticism is welcome.  If you are interested in contributing to this project or you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know by posting at http://groups.google.com/group/mpd-webamp. </p>

<p>A new name is needed, there is another project with a very simlar name.  Suggestions welcome.</p>
 title : The myopen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OPP is seeking to encourage experimentation with myoelectric control in order to inspire more rapid development of mechatronic prostheses for amputees. Because of the extremely small market size for upper extremity prosthetics, we think that one way to encourage this activity is to develop toys or user customizable devices that are capable of myoelectric signal processing. With wider access and experimentation with the technology, perhaps we could see interesting developments beyond the traditional venues of corporate R&amp;D and educational institution research. </p>

<p>Along with a couple of collaborators (and we&#39;d love to have more), we are exploring the development of an extremely flexible open hardware module that could be used with the Buglabs device, the LEGO NXT platform, and as a USB device that could be used with the OLPC (laptop.org), and traditional linux and windows computers. The components of the device would be modular, so we could populate them as needed, and use the same design for a variety of applications. The USB interface could also be used for connecting to game consoles, such as the Xbox360 and Playstation 3; the I2C bus may be useful for connecting to the Nintendo Wii via the Nunchuck input.</p>

 title : The retlang Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Retlang is a robust library for writing highly concurrent applications. The library borrows part of its name and design from Erlang. </p>

<p>Retlang provides a concurrency solution that is quite different from basic locking solutions, Parallel FX, or the .NET thread pool. With Retlang, application components exchange messages asynchronously rather than using low level locking and blocking api&#39;s. Messages are delivered sequentially to prevent thread races or object synchronization. It is similar in design to event-based actors in Scala. </p>

 title : The ubuntumini Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Veilig browsen en downloaden in windows zonder virussen binen te halen.... dat kan !!! Ubuntu Mini is een virtual machine , dat is een besturings systeem gedraaid in een geëmuleerde pc , in feite gewoon een soort van media player maar dan speelt deze geen muziek en video maar een kleine variant van ubuntu linux , een open source besturings systeem gebouwd op de stabiele debian linux en momenteel het populairste open source besturings systeem op de markt. Ubuntu Mini maakt gebruik van Vmware player , dit is de leidende gratis virtualisatie software op de markt , het voordeel van het gebruik van zo&#39;n virtuele omgeving is dat als je VM besmet word met een virus dat die dan niet in de rest van je pc kan komen zodat windows lekker virus-vrij blijft. Gezien de meeste virussen alleen kwaad kunnen in windows kan je dus met deze VM gewoon virussen mee binnen halen , ze vervolgens scannen en ze dan virus-vrij naar je windows schijf slepen. </p>

<p>ubuntu mini is gebouwd op de basis installatie van ubuntu edgy 6.10 maar lijkt hier verder niet op gezien het gebruik maakt van de super lichtgewicht desktop managers fluxbox en Enlightment zodat de VM snel draait op de meeste moderne pc&#39;s met windows xp. Het is bij het opstarten mogelijk om te kiezen of je in fluxbox of enlightment wil werken (standaard is fluxbox) </p>

<p>Ubuntu Mini is gemaakt voor iedereen die veilig wil browsen en downloaden en is dus ook heel simpel in gebruik , de installatie ervan gaat nog net niet vanzelf en na de installatie komt u met een rechter muis klik in het menu terecht met alle programma&#39;s , meer is er simpelweg niet echter alles wat u nodig heeft is daar. Ubuntu Mini is voorgeïnstalleerd met de volgende software: </p>

<p>Enlightment : window manager ,grafische desktop omgeving Fluxbox : window manager , grafische desktop omgeving Thunar bestands browser : voor het browsen door je locale bestanden. Mozilla Firefox : voor het surfen op het internet. Amsn : voor het chatten via msn , irc , icq en yahoo. Ktorrent : voor het downloaden en delen van torrent bestanden. Gtk-Gnutella : voor het delen van bestanden op het gnutella netwerk. Ark : voor het aanmaken en uitpakken van archiefbestanden (rar,zip,tar,gz,etc.) Xmms : voor het afspelen van audio bestanden en online radio streams. Vlc media player : voor het afspelen van alle video bestanden. Gedit : voor het lezen en bewerken van text bestanden. Acroread : acrobat reader voor Linux , lees en bewerk pdf bestanden. Avast home edition : gratis virus scanner om downloads te scannen. Gnome app install : Voor het gemakkelijk installeren van extra software. Synaptic pakketbeheer : voor het installeren van extra software. Network manager : voor het automatisch beheren van je netwerk verbindingen. Samba : voor het delen van bestanden met het lokale windows netwerk. Eterm : terminal voor het uitvoeren van opdrachten vanaf de command-line. Gnome-terminal : voor het uitvoeren van opdrachten vanaf de command-line. Gdm : de gnome display manager. </p>

<p>Zoals u ziet is Ubuntu Mini ook echt Minimaal in tegenstelling tot de andere Buntu&#39;s , echt gemaakt voor internet gebruik binnen windows dus en voorlopig zal dat ook zo blijven , Mischien dat er in de toekomst nog een installeerbare variant komt voor op oudere pc&#39;s zodat deze ook nog wat langer dienst kunnen doen als download pc maar daar word momenteel al goed voor gezorgd door xubuntu en de nieuwe fluxbuntu en dus daar is niet bepaald haast bij en mischien ook niet echt behoefte naar. </p>

<p>Het installeren van extra software is in ubuntu ook geen probleem , met Gnome app install en synaptic pakketbeheer zoek en installeer je in een paar klikken alle beschikbare software. Ook het installeren van ubuntu mini en vmware player zelf is heel makelijk gemaakt zodat iedereen het kan installeren. Voor hulp bij het installeren en gebruik kunt u terecht in het ubuntu mini suport forum , daar vind u ook alle andere ubuntu mini gerelateerde informatie zoals screenshots , oude- en test-versies van Ubuntu Mini en contact gegevens.</p>

 summary : <p>Aplicación J2ME simple para aprender el idioma catalán para las personas que hablan español. </p>

<p>J2ME simple application to learn the catalan language for the people who speak spanish. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ademas de la aplicacion en si, esta disponible el codigo fuente asi como los archivos de audio en formato MP3 necesarios para poder escuchar las frases en Catalan. Las pistas de audio estan en un archivo aparte por su tamaño, dado que las aplicaciones para dispositivos mobiles han de cumplir unas caracteristicas entre ellas la del tamaño, es por eso que la aplicacion consta de dos partes , la interfaz y las pistas de audio, y en dependencia de la opcion que se seleccione esta interfaz reproducira el correspondiente archivo de audio en formato MP3. </p>

<p>Entorno de desarrollo: Netbeans 6.1 y su Mobility Pack </p>

<p>Pruebas: Realizadas en el emulador que trae el Mobility Pack </p>

<p>Pruebas hardware:  Nokia 6234 con una tarjeta de memoria para expansion- </p>

<p>La interfaz usa las pistas de audio que estan en esta tarjeta de memoria de expasion ya que la interna que trae el 6234 me era insuficiente. </p>

<p>la ruta usaba para la llamada es : &quot;file:///e:/Program Files/Lengua catalana&quot;.... </p>

<p>Donde los puntos(....) son subcarpetas alli presentes. La ruta esta fija, por lo que si se desea usar otra,se necesita recompilar la aplicacion, lo cual no supone mucho esfuerzo , es solo bajarse el IDE Netbeans, el paquete completo es el que yo uso, bajarse la fuente del proyecto, buscar las rutas,modificarlas por las necesarias. En una proxima version, las rutas de las pistas de audio se podran configurar. </p>

<p>In addition to the application itself, is available the source code as well as audio files in MP3 format needed to hear the phrases in Catalan. The audio tracks are in a separate file for its size, given that applications for mobile devices have to comply with features including the size, that is why the application consists of two parts, the interface and audio tracks, and depending on the option you select this interface reproduce the corresponding audio file in MP3 format. </p>

<p>Development Environment: Netbeans 6.1 and Mobility Pack </p>

<p>Evidence: Made in the emulator that brings Mobility Pack </p>

<p>Tests hardware: Nokia 6234 with a memory card for expansion </p>

<p>The interface uses the audio tracks that are in this memory card expansion since the 6234 internal brings me was insufficient. </p>

<p>the route used for the call is: &quot;file: ///e:/Program Files/Catalan language&quot;.... </p>

<p>Where are the points (....) subfolders bystanders. The route is fixed, so if you want to use another, you need to recompile the application, which does not involve much effort is just getting off the Netbeans IDE, the complete package is the one I use, get off the source of the project, seek routes, for the necessary modification. In an upcoming release, routes the audio tracks may be set.</p>

<p>Change Log for Alpha release 3.0: </p>

<p>1.Shows hidden files and folders with separate icons than the normal ones. 2.Improved the support for Sony Ericsson phones. Should work but haven&#39;t tested though. Do send feedback 3.Added support for zip files and nokia themes but it&#39;s under work and will not work. 4.Changed the UI a bit adding a shortcut to jump directly to a path 5.Added a torch with different colors. The flashlight doesn&#39;t work yet. 6.Added Nokia Theme creator UI. Still under development. 7.Support for zipping files and upzipping them. Working on them. To get torch which remains ON permanently press the UP arrow which changes the brightness level. </p>

<p>Torch Keys: Left Softkey(Nokia): Change color Right Softkey(Nokia): Go back </p>

 title : The finarea-midlet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it about?Finarea/Betamax is a VOIP service provider offering cheap calling rates by various services, e.g. sipdiscount.com, freecall.com, voipbuster.com etc... </p>

<p>The finarea-midlet emulates the actions neccessary to initiate a call using the web interface of these services by sending the same HTTP requests as the browser does if done manually. This way you can have ultra-cheap (or even free) calls from your mobile! Here is what happens: </p>

<p>start the finarea-midlet choose the contact you want to call  select one of the services you configured, e.g. freecall.com finarea-midlet opens a HTTP connection (additional costs may apply depending on your data plan!), logs in your freecall.com account and initiates the call a few seconds later you will receive the callback. Once you accept the call you will be  connected to the other party.   </p>

<p>How to get started?get a freecall.com account (it&#39;s absolutely free, but you need to download their software in order to register). With freecall.com you don&#39;t need to pay anything, you can start making free calls using their software or their web interface right now! download and install FinareMidlet configure it by adding your callback number and your Finarea/Betamax accounts make free calls from your mobile!   </p>

<p>RequirementsYou need a J2ME enabled phone, optionally with the JSR 75 PIM (Personal Information Management) API in order to access your contacts. Since version 0.2 you can also download a non-JSR75 version of the FinareaMidlet. Also a data plan would be a good idea because the finarea-midlet will connect to a web server in order to initate a cheap/free call. </p>

<p>Linkshow to set up and configure the midlet for different Finarea/Betamax services? Check out the instructions in the wiki Comparison (calling rates updated daily) of the various Finarea/Betamax services: http://backsla.sh/betamax Known Limitations and Bugs  </p>

<p>it has been reported that v0.1 did not work with some Sony-Ericsson phones as it crashed during the start of the application when the contacts are loaded. Unfortunately I have no SE device to test with. Please try the non-JSR75 version of the FinareaMidlet instead.  the finarea-midlet sometimes says &quot;you will be called back&quot; but you will not be called back due to some error message or bad call status which could not be caught by finarea-midlet (those who are pushed to the client via AJAX). If you believe that the call should succeed, please test it on the web interface of your Finarea service first before reporting a bug. registration of new users can not be done with Finarea Midlet, you need to download the phone software of the Finarea service in order to register. It seems that the registration is done via a non-HTTP protocol and is therefore hard to implement in finarea-midlet.  </p>

<p>Changelogv0.2 Finarea/Betamax accounts are now managed and stored within the application, no manual editing of the .jad file anymore enter and call arbitrary numbers added non-JSR75 version to support more devices v0.1 initial version call numbers from your phone&#39;s contact list either direct connection to service or usage of PHP callscript possible</p>

 title : The lc-cartrack Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThis program allows turning any GSM phone supporting python and bluetooth into a GPS car antitheft. Upon receiving properly formatted SMS, phone replies with an SMS containing its GPS position and/or uploading position to a web server. Program can work in &quot;one reply&quot; and &quot;tracking&quot; mode; in the second case, upon receving the triggering SMS is starts sending location-SMSs (or uploading data)at user-defined time intervals, to allow real time tracking.  </p>

<p>No subscription to online service required, just a cellphone subscription is required. Variant with SMS sending can be useful in case no PHP-supporting server is available. </p>

<p>Written in Pys60, tested on Nokia 6600/6680. </p>

<p>DetailsAlternativesThere are several programs around capable of tracking a phone via GPS, but looks like all of them require &quot;free subscription&quot; to some services, or they only allow tracking through GoogleMaps, or just export KML files to be manually loaded into GoogleEarth. Boring. </p>

<p>I have a better idea: I publish the source of a PHP script which anyone can store on any server he likes, possibly a free hosting service (which must support PHP, such as http://www.altervista.org ). </p>

<p>How it worksThis script receives position data from a program installed on your phone, which can be: LCCarTrack or Trakkcor </p>

<p>The first is written by me, in python, and it&#39;s currently under development. First version sent position by SMS directly to the phone. New version (currently UNstable) sends data over GPRS; being it a matter of a few hundreds of byte, each upload should cost much less than 1 cent (with my plan I pay 6 euro/MB, i.e. 0.000006 euro/byte , or 0.0006 euro per upload!). The biggest issue with my program is that pys60 does not support socket timeout, so in case of missing network the program locks up! </p>

<p>The second program is an opensource j2me midlet: just like my program it allows sending data to any webserver (in my program you have to manually edit the source, in Trakkcor you just edit an option). The main advantage is that (I guess) java is more robust in case of missing network, so it shouldn’t lock up. </p>

<p>I think my final choice will be to &quot;couple&quot; trakkcor to LCCartrack, getting it called by LCCarTrack every time an upload is needed. </p>

<p>In the meantime, you can use Trakkcor alone to track your mobile: once you authorize it to connect to gprs, it does not ask anymore, so you can start autoupload (&quot;Live tracker&quot;) and put the phone on the car (or whatelse) you want to track. </p>

<p>Try it: See your current position on a web page or in GoogleEarth!You can try it with these parameters: </p>

<p>URL: http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/upload_trakkcor.php </p>

<p>NMEA message type: $GPGGA </p>

<p>HTTP method: GET </p>

<p>Your upload will be stored into two files: </p>

<p>http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/trakkcor.txt  (history) </p>

<p>http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/trakkcor.kml (current position) </p>

<p>You can add the second address to GoogleEarth (menu ADD-&gt;Network Link) and set your favourite refresh: this will result in your position being continuously updated as you move. :) </p>

<p>Don&#39;t have a GPS receiver right now? Manually send a fake position and chek it on GoogleEarth, just by opening this url (specify your own coordinates, LAT and LON): http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/upload.php?pos=42.0,12.0 </p>

<p>Then check your position on http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/lccartrack.txt and (in GoogleEarth) http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/lccartrack.kml  </p>

<p>GoogleEarth on phone?But not all people has a notebook PC, so here it is another idea: use MGMapsto track the phone on another phone; this program allows displaying position on a map without downloading maps from network, but rather using cached maps, which you can for example produce using Microsoft MapCrunch, to obtain maps even from scanned images! After installing MGMaps, open Application Manager of phone, select MGMaps, and grant permission to allow file system reading: this will prevent MGMaps from asking you for permission every time it loads map from phone. Then, launch MGMaps, and choose Services-&gt;View KML : insert the above address for KML file. This will result in MGMaps loading position from network and displaying it on a map on the screen. Unfortunately there is no auto-update option (AFAIK) at this moment, so you have to manually refresh the waypoint. But fortunately an SDK for MGMaps exists (http://www.nutiteq.com/ ), which should allow writing own midlets which just show position on a map (without all other MGMaps options) and implements autorefresh.</p>

Both tiles and XML formatted OSM data can be used to display the maps. If the device is associated with a GPS receiver (internally or externally through bluetooth), it will also be possible to record GPX traces. Aside of displaying maps and tracking roads you can use the application to do some basic OSM tagging. Devices with the possibility to take pictures can use this to automatically get ExIF data included in the pictures. Another cool feature is the QtScript, this makes it possibility to write your own extensions for CityMap.  </p>

<p>FeaturesWritten in Qt under the GPLv2 license. Compatible with Qt supported devices (win CE, maemo, OpenMoko,..) Can display OSM data (XML) Can display OSM tiles Can record GPX tracks Put GPS data in Photos with ExIF Can start a scenario that you might have written yourself in QtScript  </p>

 title : The trafficlc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Programma in Java j2me (per qualunque cellulare CLDC 1.0 MIDP 2.0) per visualizzare in tempo reale lo stato del traffico sul Grande Raccordo Anulare di Roma. </p>

<p>Testato su: </p>

<p>Motorola a1000 
<br/>Nokia 6600 
<br/>Nokia 6680 
<br/>Nokia n70 
<br/>Nokia n73 
<br/>Nokia n80 
<br/>  </p>

<p>Nokia n96 </p>

<p>Il programma si avvale dei dati forniti dal sito http://www.baluardoproductions.com/gra/ ; benchè il sito non citi la fonte di provenienza dei dati, è intuibile che essi siano prodotti  http://edoedo.comze.com/strade.php (in sostituzione del precedente che non funziona piu&#39;) che riporta in modo piu&#39; conciso i dati forniti dalla Octotelematics, che fornisce questo tipo di dati, in forma grafica, per tutta la rete autostradale italiana: http://traffico.octotelematics.it/ </p>

<p>E&#39; anche possibile scaricare una breve pagina web appositamente formattata per i cellulari, le cui dimensioni possono essere regolate variando i parametri nell&#39;indirizzo (ad esempio, la pagina a colori occupa almeno 10 volte piu&#39; spazio di quella in bianco e bero, e quella coi nomi degli svincoli occupa 20 volte piu&#39; spazio di quella senza nomi): </p>

<p>http://spazio.110mb.com/stats.php?&amp;data=local&amp;type=color&amp;names=false&amp;selection=2 </p>

<p>Specificando un numero come parametro &quot;selection&quot; è possibile scegliere quale tratto di autostrada visualizzare. Attualmente le opzioni disponibili sono quelle riportate nella pagina dei Numeri. </p>

<p>Parametri: </p>

<p>data=local (riservato agli sviluppatori) </p>

<p>type=color/nocolor  (la versione a colori comporta un&#39;occupazione di spazio maggiore) </p>

<p>data=local (riservato agli sviluppatori) </p>

<p>names=true/false (mostra oppure no i nomi degli svincoli) </p>

<p>selection=numero (specifica quale tratto di strada mostrare, secondo questa lista). </p>

<p>Forum di riferimento: http://www.nokioteca.net/home/forum/index.php?showtopic=125247&amp;hl= </p>

<p>Trattandosi di dati forniti in  forma grafica, l&#39;uso su cellulare non è consigliabile, visti i costi che comporterebbe lo scaricamento. Il sito Baluardoproductions fornisce gli stessi dati (per il solo raccordo anulare di Roma) in forma testuale, per un ammontare totale di circa 4000 byte. Alcuni operatori telefonici non richiedono nessun pagamento per trasferimenti inferiori ai 6000 byte, quindi la connessione risulta di fatto gratuita, ma anche con gli operatori piu&#39; cari, che arrivano a 6 euro/MB, lo scaricamento di 4000 bytes corrisponde a una spesa di circa 0,023 euro, ossia 2,3 centesimi di euro. </p>

<p>Disabilitazione tastiera virtualeAlcuni cellulari mostrano sullo schermo, per i programmi java, una tastiera virtuale, che puo&#39; nascondere parte della schermata.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In genere questa tastiera è disattivabile; per esempio, sul nokia 5800 si fa cosi&#39;: </p>

 title : The wikoplacemarks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>One of the most commonly used tools for browsing the earth surface is Google Earth, being the oldest. Google Earth can save landmark locations in its own database, featuring icons, description, a specific camera orientation, etc… And as the technology advanced, now we have mobile phones supporting maps, and with integrated GPS receivers, they can identify the user’s location with very high accuracy. My case phone, Nokia N78, is equipped with Nokia Maps and has an integrated A-GPS receiver. Nokia mobile phones with GPS receivers include E90, E71, E66, N85, N79, N95, N95 8GB, N78, N96, N96 8GB, 6220 Classic, 6210 Navigator and 6110 Navigator. Other companies like HTC, i-mate, and Apple have also equipped some of their phones with GPS receivers and navigation applications. As for the last few years, GPS-equipped mobiles have increased outside Egypt at a high rate. Although GPS devices are prohibited in Egypt, they are still being imported, sold and used. Google Earth can save its landmarks into external files. It started with saving KML format which uses XML, and in later versions, Google have created a new file format called KMZ to save landmark files. However, the later versions still support saving in KML formats. Nokia Maps can also save and send landmark files as LMX files. The LMX format also uses XML. </p>

<p>I first implemented the application, Placemarks, in January 2008 during my winter break. I used C++ and a command driven interface, which was all I studied at AUC. However I did some research to be able to make it through. Version 1.0 converted from KML to LMX only, but it validated the file extension and format before any conversion takes place. </p>

<p>Last summer, after I studied JAVA and researched C#, I implemented the totally new version 2.0 using C#. I implemented a class for each format that contains functions and variables that deal with this format, i.e. read and write in the format. All formats were compiled under one DLL called “formats.dll”. The main program uses a GUI to interact with the user. The user is given an empty list, where he can open KML or LMX files and add their content to this list. The list has check boxes where the user can uncheck any unwanted Placemarks. Finally, the user saves the new list into a new file of any supported format. For example, I load Placemarks 2.0, then click “Load” to load Placemarks. I open file1.kml, then load another file called file2.lmx. The content of both files will be added to the list. I uncheck 4 Placemarks that I don’t need on my mobile. Then, save the new list as newFile.lmx. Finally I send it via Bluetooth to my Nokia N78. And now, I can reach any of the destinations in file1.kml or file2.lmx using the A-GPS integrated into my mobile phone.  </p>

<p>Placemarks is a studio for managing your placemark files saved in any supported format. You can add placemarks to the list and choose which placemarks to save in the destination file. You can read from multiple files in different formats.</p>

Our company, 1186 Entertainment, has been hired by Serial Foods Co. to create an online Reversi game as part of their promotion for Marshmallow Binary Bits.  (The online game will follow the standard rules of Reversi which can be read about at .)  The game will allow players to connect with other users and play games of Reversi over the internet through a Java applet front end.  The game will include real time networking which will allow players to chat as they play.  The server will relay game information and user chat messages between the clients.  It will also use multi-threading to support multiple clients and games.  Users may sign up for an account to keep track of rank, or they may sign in as a guest for a quick anonymous game.  User login and ranking information will be stored in a database.</p>
 title : The 3dmotioncapture Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Motion Capture and End User InterfaceAbstractWe describe a 3D hand gesture recognition system to control a computer‐based application. Therefore, the user can control the applications not only by touching on the screen but also walking around in front of the computer. The application can be entertainment software, such as albums and video players. It can also be a presentation tools which like Power Point. This project would divided into two main sections, the first section is about the gesture recognition algorithm; the second sections is about the design and interface of human computer interaction (HCI). </p>

<p>IntroductionIn recently years, many researches were done on the topic of human computer interaction. It raised the awareness of using human gestures in natural way to control the computer in order to replace the traditional input devices, such as keyboards, mouse or joystick. 1 However, most of the researches were done in two dimensional interfaces, such as touch screen whiteboard. Therefore, there would have the limitation of using area. The users need to have the direct contact with the screen; it would not be a suitable way when using a huge screen. Besides, developing the hardware of high scale touch screen application, it raised others disadvantages which included the cost and portability. Therefore, the recognition system needs to be migrated from two dimensional to three dimensional. With using the new 3D recognition system, it will have more descriptions about the gestures, such as distance between the screen and the user. It will make the application be more “human‐natural”. The user can control the application while walking around the room. Also, the problem of portability can also be solved. The system consists of several cameras and software. After a workstation pung‐in the cameras and installed the software, it can use the system. So the screen size can be changed time by time. The flexibility can be solved. Apart from this, the hardware of the system changed from the whiteboard to the cameras. So, it can greatly improve the portability.</p>

 title : The agg-sharp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Moved the main site to https://sourceforge.net/projects/agg-sharp . </p>

<p>All new releases and the most current svn can be found there. </p>

<p>Version  New Features   .5  added Image Filters, Image Resample, Alpha Mask2 and Lion Outline   .4  added Perspective and Blur   .3  added image1 and optimizations   .2  lion and rounded_rect demos  </p>

<p>New: Version .5 demos uploaded. The new code is mostly about raster image transformations.  Image Resample implements many high quality image transforms and alpha mask2 gives the ability to create great stencil or masking effects. </p>

<p>ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo </p>

<p>Version .4 demos uploaded. We have implemented the Perspective demo witch renders the lion with skewing and perspective and the blur demo which implements a gaussian blur (the stack blur from agg has not as yet been implemented). </p>

<p>Version .3 demos uploaded.  This implements the image1 sample which shows image transforms.  All demos are also all much faster. </p>

<p>Similar to AggPas (a pascal port of AGG) agg-sharp is an c# port of the Anti-Grain Geometry library - AGG, originally written by Maxim Shemanarev in industrially standard C++. AGG as well as agg-sharp is an Open Source, and free of charge, 2D vector graphics library. </p>

<p>Agg-sharp doesn&#39;t depend on any graphic API or technology. Basically, you can think of agg-sharp as a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data.  </p>

<p>Long term we also plan to implement an OpenGL hardware accelerated rasterizer for the library. </p>

<p>More screenshots... </p>

<p>IntroductionBombermen is a computer arcade game based on the classic Dynablaster and Atomic bomberman specified to be highly configurable and playable, to be one of the best network bomberman games. Bombermen implies/implements all the features of the mentioned classical games, highly supports network games and has some new concepts of gameplay. Changing settings/turning off these features gives the possibility of operating exactly like the ancestors. </p>

<p>New concepts include that players have vitality. That means they do not die when the fire of a bomb reaches them, they will be damaged depending on several factors. This new concept gives reason for existance of another new concept: the multiple fire concept. This means for example that if a level component (a wall or a player itself) can be damaged on a higher degree if fire of several bomb reaches it. </p>

<p>The name Bombermen itself (plural of Bomberman) alludes at its strong network support, its multiplayer support. </p>

<p>This includes but not limited to: </p>

<p>supports players up to 4 from one computer unlimited network computers connected to a game optimized network bandwidth to be minimal network latency handling and latency settings </p>

<p>The game rules are highly configurable as well resulting in high user/play experience. </p>

<p>Bombermen is open graphical, anyone can create new graphic theme and the game will offer the available themes for the users to choose from. The application window and the game area is freely sizable. Supports full screen mode and real-time image scaling. </p>

<p>DocumentationBombermen is fully documented. Documentations include: </p>

 title : The buttbot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Buttbot is a social experiment in humour and interaction, it playfully mocks those around it. Almost deconstructionist in nature by manipulating the context of the text it parodies, it forces people to reexamine what has been said in a new light. </p>

<p>It builds on the tradition of mechanising surrealist techniques, such as example Dadadodo by Jwz implementing the cut-up technique made famous by William S. Burroughs (and used by Radiohead). However instead of merely rearranging the content, buttbot aims to augment it with the simplistic low brow humour. </p>

<p>The use of puerile humour is mainly to bring the conversation back down to earth, to remind us that in our intellectual pursuits that childish references to anatomy can bring a smile to our faces.</p>
 title : The buylocalopensourcerensselaer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Visit the project&#39;s blog at http://buylocalrpi.blogspot.com. </p>

<p>Troy has a lot of potential; it is the second fastest growing city in the Capital District area of New York State (“City Receives…”). If you contact the mayor’s office in this picturesque town on the Hudson River, you will probably get a decent sized list of prospective investors and developers.  With the local government of cities all over the United States typically focused on offering incentives to draw “big business,” who is looking out for the “little man?” </p>

<p>When it comes to prices and convenience, at first glance, local businesses, or, “Small-Marts” are seemingly at a disadvantage compared to mega-chain stores such as “Walmart.”  However, if you take into account the socio-economic footprint of such megastores you find that consumers are subsidizing big business (Shuman 5).  It also makes sense that local businesses tend to invest more money and human capital locally.  So a consumer might find that an extra few dollars spent locally, in the final analysis, actually saves them money. </p>

<p>It will definitely save them peace of mind, since it is well known that the carbon footprint of a product bought from a large “fulfillment” business like Walmart, or, Safeway, is much larger (due to a top-down structure of organization that makes shipping goods across country a regular occurrence), than the same one bought from your corner grocer.   </p>

<p>With knowledge about the conveniently walkable distances of local businesses, more Troy residents may be encouraged to live healthier, less polluting lifestyles while saving money on gas and promoting a greater sense of community.   As middle-class consumers become more aware about how their purchasing decisions affect their local community, there is a greater need for tools that will make buying local easier (Shuman 105-109).  With the success of such websites as Amazon.com redefining the shopping experience, it is arguable that online shopping focused on local purchasing options may be a viable way of helping to sustain the community.  Buy Local will be developed in Drupal and aims to be this new online shopping experience. What makes this invention so exciting is that it is a mesh-work.  It combines the socio-economics of sustainable local shopping with the tools of the internet.  Using ideas that savvy internet surfers are already familiar with:  user reviews, searchable inventory, map directions, etc., it offers them an opportunity to find a specific product…down the street.  This service is different from online yellow pages because the inventory is more specific, and can be purchased with a click of a button.  It is also different from traditional Web Services, because it is not for one specific vendor, but for all local vendors.  Finally, if distributed as freeware through the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE) and similar agencies, it is uniquely positioned to help build “flexible specialization” into local economies by encouraging competitive “craft production”(Piore &amp; Sabel). </p>

<p>In conclusion, a new online shopping experience, “Buy Local” is under development that encourages sustainable local development by giving consumers access to a streamlined tool for buying locally. </p>

 summary : <p>-- The CLIMAX Candy Suite BETA -- </p>

<p>CLIMAX. The pinnacle of achievement. The top of its game. True Hackers everywhere have known that you find the most power available at your fingertips in a pure, uncluttered command line interface. The most fun a True Hacker will have on a computer is found in issuing direct commands to the machine, and having it listen. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, most software released today can neither be said to be uncluttered, nor can it rightly be called fun. </p>

<p>So we write our own. Countless little scripts and utilities that do something useful. Or not useful. (Not every command line utility has to have a purpose; there are many that we write simply to amuse ourselves when things get dull). </p>

<p>The problem is that, with all the attention given to commercial, GUI-based solutions, the CLI is often overlooked as a source of productivity and entertainment. </p>

<p>That has SO got to change. </p>

<p>The CLIMAX Frameworks bring the CLI back to its proper place as the first and most convenient tool we reach for every day, encouraging coders to easily develop for the CLI when writing a new tool. </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s Candy.. Candy isn&#39;t good for a main meal, but is nice in little bits here and there. Some of the programs in the Candy Suite are really useful though! (Check out the included program called gcode for an example). Together in this suite of software you will find productivity and entertainment married into a seriously lighthearted set of tools and frameworks. </p>

<p>You sort of get twins when you download The CLIMAX Candy Suite: </p>

<p>- The CLIMAX Frameworks, enabling you to quickly author new CLI tools in your favorite language. 
<br/>- The Candy Suite, making the CLI more safe, more efficient, and more fun! </p>

<p>I hope that you will deeply enjoy CLIMAX, and mind you don&#39;t eat all the candy at once!  </p>

<p>PROJECT NEWS: </p>

<p>Both the SVN repo and the downloads page have the latest BETA release available, currently including only programs from the Candy Suite. I am working on the CLIMAX Frameworks further before posting them, so just enjoy the Candy Suite for now. ;] </p>

<p>The first framework I&#39;ll be finishing is for writing CLI programs in PHP. </p>

<p>If you are writing a CLI utility in PHP5, you have to handle arguments and stuff by hand, right? Include and extend the PHP CLIMAX Framework, which handles things such as reading in command-line arguments, echoing ascii-art chrome, etc. Basic tasks such as database read/write, apache management, and XBOS management are also included. I&#39;m just wrapping up development on the PHP5 version. Look for that, and initial progress on the C version, coming soon. </p>

<p> new ( For a preview of all the languages for which there will be a framework, peek at the empty folders inside /trunk/climax/ ) </p>

<p>With Climax, you will be able to quickly develop command-line utilities, database utilities, web server utilities, and OS-level utilities without having to start from scratch every time!</p>

 title : The felbot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Felbot is a client written to join chat rooms via the Battle.net gaming network, by emulating the protocols used by various games by Blizzard Entertainment. Currently it supports emulation of the StarCraft, Diablo II, WarCraft II, and WarCraft III protocols as well as their expansions, the legacy clients, and the CHAT protocol (for private Bnet servers still in existence). </p>

<p>Felbot is designed with educational value in mind. When it is completed, it should support most standard features of chat clients, as well as demonstrate proper coding techniques and show examples of how to perform certain tasks. With this in mind, the entire codebase is aiming to be a polished resource for other developers. </p>

<p>Current VersionClick to download Felbot v1.2.1 No Hashes You can also download the one with hashes (6 MB!) if you need the hashes. </p>

<p>Yes, Felbot requires hashes, since I don&#39;t have or plan to have BNLS support. I do plan to have a better (in-bot maybe) hash getting system in the next version so that there will be one installer and the bot gets hashes and verbytes it doesn&#39;t have when the user needs them. </p>

 title : The l-echo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Notice: As of 3-20-09, I am no longer developing this.  This is a failure on my part, because of my bad coding practices.  I can no longer maintain and add to my code, so this project is becoming a huge time sink.  I&#39;m sorry for those who wanted a full echochrome clone; I guess you&#39;ll have to wait for a good PSP emulator, or another programmer who is willing to write another echochrome clone (I&#39;m happy to teach the concepts to anyone who wants to take up the challenge). </p>

<p>Update 7-30-09, it occurred to me (in the process of preparing the last n-echo release for a homebrew contest) that I never finished the doc on how to create stages.  That&#39;s finally fixed. </p>

<p>L-Echo is a free and open source clone of the SCEJ game Echochrome (Mugen Kairou in Japan) (PSP/PS3).   It was written for Linux but has been ported to Windows, Mac OS X (10.4+) (NOT PPC64) and the Nintendo DS (see right below). </p>

<p>L-Echo Video (0.4.1) </p>

<p>N-Echo is a port (in the same source tree) for the Nintendo DS. </p>

<p>N-Echo Video (0.4.0) </p>

<p>IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES, JUST PLEASE, TAKE A SECOND, AND FILE AN ISSUE, using the &quot;Issues&quot; tab on the top there! </p>

<p>Releases: </p>

<p>0.4.3 - Holy crap: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Damn, Free Gamer sure is popular. </p>

<p>Well, 0.4.3 is out, with minor changes: </p>

<p>Whopping one more stage - LEcho1.xml is an exclusive puzzle (I think) I made; IT ONLY WORKS WITH 0.4.3+ (a bug in earlier versions crashes the game after you get to the first echo).  I realized that the zoom level is horrible, so I promise I&#39;ll put a zoom function into the next release. Falling Animation - It isn&#39;t as good as I would like it to be, but I don&#39;t think I can expect to much from trig functions. </p>

<p>0.4.2 - Finally, after 30 revisions and nearly 2 months, here&#39;s release 0.4.2.  I didn&#39;t use 0.5 because the 0.4.x series (animations) is still not done yet.  Consider 0.4.2 as a large maintenance release.  Changes: </p>

<p>NEWNewHolesAndLaunchers - Complete clone of echochrome and OLE Coordinate System.  Yes, including launchers. FPS - 30Hz across all platforms Spawning - The mannequin now spawns at the last echo. Documentation - Most of the code is now well-documented. After 0.4.x, 0.5.x will consist of the level creator, which will be Java-based.  Audio will be implemented in 0.6.x.  It will play ONLY WAV/PCMs. </p>

<p>revision 103 - r103 pretty much completes the documentation project.  Now I just need to complete the launchers, and fix the holes (I hear that the character is supposed to rotate in space too...?). </p>

<p>revision 96 - Still...trucking...on...to...the...next...release... N-Echo is working correctly now, and, with the new libnds, it&#39;s likely to stream WAV instead of MP3. </p>

<p>revision 83 - By no means is r83 working correctly, but here are some changes you&#39;ll see in 0.4.2. The release has deviated from the RoadMap, but it&#39;s a needed maintenance: </p>

<p>NEWNewHolesAndLaunchers - The new implementation of holes and launchers is WAY simpler than the other 2 designs.  Holes is working as of r83, though there are some strange bugs, like the character falling into the grid next to it.  I&#39;ll have to add some distance restrictions.  Launchers still need to be implemented, but it should be pretty simple, and similar to holes, though I still need to know just how high the mannequin jumps. Audio support - You can&#39;t play it yet (probably will read from a playlist in a prefs file), but the functions have been put in place (see echo_mp3.h and echo_mp3.cpp) OpenAL for Windows/Mac/Linux, and ASLib for NDS.  MP3s will be used for music, though I&#39;m still having trouble with sound effects such as the mannequin&#39;s footsteps (probably WAVs for OpenAL; you can do weird shit like Doppler effect in there). FPS - Has been fixed to 30Hz Spawning - The mannequin now spawns at the last echo. Position - Technical stuff: the position in grid_info_t is now a pointer for consistency. Documentation - I&#39;m starting to document the source code via Doxygen, mainly to attract new developers (perhaps after 1.0, or now). </p>

<p>0.4.1 - Through the magic that is Inverse Kinematics, the mannequin can walk up stairs now!  Yay! </p>

<p>0.4.0 - THANK GOD FOR PUGIXML!  N-Echo is BACK with WALKING ANIMATION! </p>

<p>To make this change, I had to abstract the xml libraries away; just by changing the Makefile I can make l-echo compile with TinyXML (works with l-echo, but not n-echo), rapidxml (buggy) or pugxml (windows only).  Just look at echo_xml.h and echo_xml.cpp. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll probably also notice that my coding style has changed.  Now new code and revised code will by status-based. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll probably also notice that the mannequin in n-echo is unnaturally fast...I&#39;ll fix the FPS next release, because l-echo runs at 30 fps and n-echo runs at 60...Oops. </p>

<p>revision 66/67 - Not so much as a release, but since I don&#39;t want to give anyone the idea that this project is dead; it&#39;s far from it, because I&#39;m not dedicating pretty much all my time into the project. </p>

<p>Anyways, some changes: </p>

<p>1) WALK ANIMATION!!!!!SHIFT+1111!!!1!1!  It&#39;s not too realistic or like the mannequin from Echochrome, but it&#39;s a start. </p>

<p>2) The build system now includes the template itself, because I probably broke GPL in the time I took down the nds template.  I apologize to all who wanted to compile n-echo.  The instructions to compile from SVN has also been updated. </p>

<p>3) Speaking of SVN, I&#39;ve just realized that revision 60/61+ doesn&#39;t work for the NDS.  I again apologize, but it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t have my did to try it out.  The bug was mainly caused by he amount of vertexes the model required...So revision 66/67 just displays the character&#39;s head right now (for the NDS). </p>

<p>0.3.3 - I&#39;ve slightly changed the method I use to compile for Mac, and it might work this time around if it didn&#39;t the first time...I have no idea if anyone with OS X has this working, so I&#39;m just taking a crap shoot. </p>

<p>Oh, and this game DOESN&#39;T WORK IN MAC OS X PPC64.  The 10.4u OpenGL/GLUT framework isn&#39;t compiled for ppc64, and I can&#39;t get the latest damn XCode dmg file open. </p>

<p>Constant velocity and running are added (which reminds me to update the &quot;menu&quot; next release).  I also apparently forgot to add running to the DS version...Next release?  I&#39;m running out of buttons, though, so I probably have to come up with a preferences system to remember which hand you are. </p>

<p>0.3.1 - forgot to change the goals to be one of those shadow mannequins, started packing in reverse-engineered stages (oh, and I added the second solution to A1) </p>

<p>0.3.0 - Character model finished.  I should probably fix the graininess of the model (likely caused by the model&#39;s form as strips of quads. instead of a seamless polyhedron). </p>

<p>0.2.8 - After a hiatus with the nds version (size 16 font is not used now because the nds doesn&#39;t like tile overflow), this project is back on track, with 0.2.8 now packing and uploading as I speak. </p>

<p>The code has been improved overall, and the loader has been made to ignore errors and keep running rather than just quit. </p>

<p>The next release should be 0.3.0 with the character model, most likely hardcoded (since a .3ds or .obj would be overkill). </p>

<p>0.2.7 - Hardware-based outlining for all versions, because of the character (mannequin).  echochrome is done with that distinctive pen+ink style, so I should follow suit.  However, the NDS version is having some difficulties (you can see it in the stairs in A1, which is kind of hacked together).  I&#39;ve posted a thread over a gbadev; waiting for answers. </p>

<p>0.2.6 - FIXED NDS VERSION!  I didn&#39;t catch the seg fault bugs in 0.2.4 because I didn&#39;t test it with my NDS, just with DeSmume.  Well, it isn&#39;t really fixed, there&#39;s some tile problems with the loader + info screen, but otherwise there&#39;s no real problem...I think. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve written the RoadMap for this project in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>0.2.5 - As I&#39;m writing this right now, release 0.2.5 should be uploaded to the download section.  Right now, I&#39;m developing in a place with slower Internet connection, so uploading releases is now a laborious task that takes hours instead of minutes. </p>

<p>This release brings you a seperation between stairs and freeform_grids; the former is for elevation changes, and the latter for visual obstacles, for perspective absence and existence. </p>

<p>0.2.4, another of those &quot;screw-it&quot; releases, adds a rudimentary menu so that it doesn&#39;t have to find &quot;sample1.xml&quot; at start time. </p>

<p>0.2.3 - N-Echo has a loader now, and the Windows in-game loader is fixed.  Again.  Sorry, but I didn&#39;t know that fstat doesn&#39;t work on Windows. </p>

<p>0.2.2 redux - L-Echo ported to Mac OS X (10.4+)! </p>

<p>0.2.2 - FIXED WINDOWS VERSION!!!! Lots of changes: </p>

<p> (Kind of) Scalable - As in, if you have a really really large stage, the camera will scale with it.  The text won&#39;t, though, which is what I&#39;m going to fix sometime in the future.  Touch Screen/Mouse Support - BOOYAH!  It might be a little buggy though.  Mature Trigger System - Look in the sample for N-Echo  Better Holes and Launchers - no perspective jumping/falling is working like it&#39;s supposed to...well, there are still a few parts to iron out.  Try perspective_jumping.xml to find out.  Instead of making the grids connect, try shifting the camera down from the connection, and see what happens. Bug Fixes: </p>

<p> The stage files now work for all three platforms (N-Echo&#39;s glRotate3f is flipped, which is why the angles were negative and the controls were wacky)  As said before, the Windows version is now fixed, because of a stupid miscalculation (usleep is in microseconds, and Sleep is in milliseconds) 0.1.1 redux - N-ECHO LIVES!  0.1.1 has been successfully ported to the Nintendo DS! </p>

<p>Well, fine, I haven&#39;t learned to draw strings yet, which is why there&#39;s no key for the loader, but it works! </p>

<p>N-Echo Video </p>

<p>0.1.1 - More of a maintenance release: -Robust loader -Awesome memory management </p>

<p>0.1.0 - In-game loaders! Yay! </p>

<p>Oh and a note: After much deliberation, I&#39;ve decided NOT TO INCLUDE REAL ECHOCHROME LEVELS IN ANY OF THE RELEASES (for now...?)! </p>

<p>0.0.9 - Launchers implemented!!! </p>

<p>No movement on N-Echo, though... </p>

<p>0.0.8 - Character class and angle ranges (see perspective_absence.xml, the other files, especially perspective_existence.xml, don&#39;t use it yet).  Makefile is finally more streamlined! </p>

<p>N-Echo port is fixed up a little, but still doesn&#39;t work: </p>

<p>http://l-echo.googlecode.com/files/n-echo_attempt-3.zip </p>

<p>0.0.7 - Better hole implementation (see HolesLauncherStaticGridAndIsectGrid), Linux and Windows binaries released.  Oh, and if anyone is interested in port L-Echo to the NDS (as N-Echo?), I&#39;ve started on the port here: </p>

<p>http://l-echo.googlecode.com/files/n-echo_attempt-2.zip </p>

<p>It&#39;s not function yet, though... </p>

<p>0.0.6 - No draw capabilities = perspective existence! (2 escgrid + 1 nodraw grid) </p>

<p>0.0.5 - Screw it. </p>

<p>0.0.4 - Stage loading, character states, and holes + &quot;t_grid&quot;&#39;s (grids with 3 neighbors...grids don&#39;t all have variable neighbors, because the max is 4...I haven&#39;t had the need to create an &quot;x_grid&quot; yet, but I will sometime in the future) </p>

<p>More screenshots... </p>

<p>DescriptionForeword: this might not be a short description, but LandFight has a lot of functionality and feature. </p>

<p>LandFight is a 2D-3D skill game. You can see the level/land of the game from above. LandFight is a 2-player game played on one computer. Each player has an aircraft to control. The players are opponents, the game is against each other. The players simple goal is to eliminate their opponent. </p>

<p>To achieve this, they can move their aircraft over the land in 3D, and they can fire using their primary (gun) and secondary (rocket launcher) weapon. </p>

<p>The players can turn to left/right, can accelerate forward/backward and they can ascend and descend with their aircraft. They have to be well aware of their height and the relation between their height and the land height below them. Crashing to the land bears the penalty of death. There is a colored height indicator for each player. Since the land is a rich, colorful relief map, knowing the map-color of our height gives us confidence and knowledge where and how to make safe manoeuvres over the land. Beyond the colored height indicator, in the players status area we can see the relations of heights in preciser numbers. Picturing 3D is done by zooming the objects over the land. </p>

<p>Players have shields which protects them against the shots. Once the shield is out, it no longer protects its owner, and the player dies – since being an aircraft – explodes. Shields can be destroyed by hitting the players with shots. Crashing the 2 players into each other results in the deaths of both player. </p>

<p>The targeting and the displaying of the game is in 2D. We just have to target the opponent in 2D, firing the gun (the primary weapon) comes with automated targeting in the 3rd dimension. If target doesn’t move, bullet will hit him if the 2D aiming was right. Of course we can predict the 2D moving, and aim in front of the player if he’s moving. Our secondary weapon is a fine weapon. The rockets are target followers. That means basically we can launch our rocket in any direction, the rocket tries to turn to its target, which is the opponent of the owner. However, the target of the rocket is always the opponent, but if we are in the  way of the rocket, and we have approximately the same height, it will hit us. Turning (of rockets) to the target includes all 3 dimensions: the horizontal plane just like the vertical height. However if any of the shots hits the land, it will be destroyed – bullets simply disappear, rockets explode. Simply disappearing and exploding into the land means leaving marks on the land – which will disappear never. This means we have to make manouvers to avoid the rockets, make them hit the land. </p>

<p>The land is randomly generated after every game for more fun. The landscape is a perfectly colored relief map. Orientation in the land is assisted by a fine minimap. It shows us the whole land and the location of the players in the land. The visible part of the land around a player is just a slice of the whole land, and is scrolled with the player in the way that the player shall be in the center of it as far as possible. All player has an own window, they all can see and scroll their own environment.  Players are not allowed to leave the land, on the boundaries they will simple be stopped, however, shots will be destroyed. </p>

<p>Needless to say, moving in 3D and handling 2 weapons requires lots of control keys – especially for 2 players. Therefore a traditional/standard keyboard is required (recommended) for a comfortable playing with the default keyboard settings. Control keys are described in the game in the help section. At any time during the game, just press F1 to get help. </p>

<p>I’m not saying it will be easy… I’m just saying it will be good.</p>

 title : The motioncapture Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionIn recently years, many researches were done on the topic of human computer interaction. It raised the awareness of using human gestures in natural way to control the computer in order to replace the traditional input devices, such as keyboards, mouse or joystick. 1? However, most of the researches were done in two dimensional interfaces, such as touch screen whiteboard. Therefore, there would have the limitation of using area. The users need to have the direct contact with the screen; it would not be a suitable way when using a huge screen. Besides, developing the hardware of high scale touch screen application, it raised others disadvantages which included the cost and portability. Therefore, the recognition system needs to be migrated from two dimensional to three dimensional. With using the new 3D recognition system, it will have more descriptions about the gestures, such as distance between the screen and the user. It will make the application be more “human‐natural”. The user can control the application while walking around the room. Also, the problem of portability can also be solved. The system consists of several cameras and software. After a workstation pung‐in the cameras and installed the software, it can use the system. So the screen size can be changed time by time. The flexibility can be solved. Apart from this, the hardware of the system changed from the whiteboard to the cameras. So, it can greatly improve the portability.</p>

 summary : <p>Today’s business demand round-the clock connectivity and seamless communication, irrespective of where we are or which time zone we operate in. Nowadays mobile phones are gaining a lot of popularity among the consumers, because people on the move need services, information and entertainment that can keep up with them. With access to mobile services, decisions and interactions happen anywhere and anytime. The value of mobile services to end-users is boosted by three separate elements: personalization, time-sensitivity and location awareness. Combining these three effectively adds even more value. One of such measure is Internet access from mobile devices. The no. of internet users on mobile have been constantly increasing and in coming years more people will be accessing the Internet from Mobile Phones. An Office Application is mainly design to provide an Office facility to Mobile end-user this application consist of three main components that are </p>

<p>1)	Word Processor 2)	Access storage 3)	Powerpoint Presenter </p>

<p>This Office Application satisfies bilateral needs in current Mobile device world .On the one side of coin it is useful to the mass crowd of Mobile devices end –user and the other side of the coin it is beneficial for Mobile service provider. Altogether, it increases utility of a Mobile device. 
<br/>Office Applications are widely used in current business scenario for daily Office work like generating Reports, Powerpoint Presentation, PivotChart view, Progress Graphs, but this application can only be used on our Personal computer.Our application is implemented  to overcome this problem. The Office Application provides many of this facilities on Mobile Devices, it is quite useful Office Application as it provides user complete control over there Office document when they are away from their Personal Computer. An Office Word is most commonly used application provides way to create to modify and browse word documents. Powerpoint Presenter is an another Office Application that facilitate user to present their Powerpoint slide through wireless media while using their Mobile devices as remote control. The Office Access component is used to manage a database, view records, searching records. All of this components provides most of the non-functional requirements of the Mobile device users Security is one of them. 
<br/>The application is self explanatory and doesn’t require explicit user training the main concern is yield of development of a software for a wireless device using well none standard platform provided by Sun Java Microsystem called J2ME. 
<br/>Word Processor : </p>

<p>Navigating Word documents in standard manner Application provides Easier formatting Edit the document Web documents  Search for a file Security &amp; unlocking data Error prevention &amp; recovery  </p>

<p>Access storage: </p>

<p>Navigate through their database file To modify records Search records  PivotTable view and PivotChart View Generate XSL Ability to import &amp; export xml Multiple undo &amp; redo. </p>

<p>Powerpoint Presenter: </p>

<p>Navigating Powerpoint Presenter in standard manner Powerpoint Presentation slide headers on Mobile screen Change slides using handphones as a remote control. Slidetext could be edited using Mobile Devices</p>

 summary : <p>January 2, 2008 </p>

<p>Well we have come up with some good ideas about a game.  The 3 characters that we decided on are 3 balls.  They will be made up of different materials.  For more information check out the wiki&#39;s GameDesignDocument.  We are starting to create some Wiki pages if you have any other information you would like to see on the wiki please let me know I will do my best to get a page up.   </p>

<p>We have some code in the repository now.  They are mostly just test applications and assimilation of some old code.  First we have resources, it contains code from a game I set out to make and just didn&#39;t get time to finish.  It has some good cameras and bounding box detection code so we thought it would be nice to include it.  Next I have a Temp and a TempNew.  Temp is a stripped down version of the Resources code.  It has some bugs but it compiles and is an empty shell containing a basic frame work for controls, camera, and sound.  The TempNew is what I am currently using for testing.  It uses the Temp code base with some minor adjustments for now although that will change.  Hopefully a lot of the code here will make it way into the dev branch although it&#39;s not there yet.  Dev will be the place for the actuall game code.  The full environment is still being worken on by kc7zax so it is currently not buildable.  We are hoping to have this be a grab and compile environment.  Currently Temp, TempNew, and resources all require a great deal of work before they will compile.  You need to get the OgreSDK and the IrrKlang SDK.  And each of those require some work as well.  So stay tuned we hope to have a newby friendly environment setup soon. </p>

<p>The design document is still very early in it development but we welcome any comments.  Please feel free to take a look. </p>

<p>We have gotten an google groups mailing list setup please check out the homepage for more information on that. </p>

<p>Coming Soon: </p>

<p>Grab and compile dev environment in the SVN.   More developments in the Design Docs Technical Doc Time Line Screen shots of our work in progress. </p>

<p>December 15, 2007 </p>

<p>We are currently in the design phase.  This is an open project right now and so as many people as would like to join may do so.  It will be a game based on the game play of the SNES game by Blizzard entertainment Lost Vikings intermixed with some of the game dynamics of the upcoming game Little Big Planet. </p>

<p>So the general overview of the project.  It will be a game comprising 3 characters.  Each of the three characters will have different abilities allowing them to solve certain puzzles.  The player may control only one of the 3 characters at any given time.  We are hoping to intergrate a fully interactive environment, or at least a highly interactive environment.  Physics will be an integral part of this game. </p>

<p>So stay tuned and stay updated.  Hopefully we will be able to grow this community to some degree.  If you are interested in joining our cause please send an e-mail to someoneinjapan@gmail.com for now until we can get a more official chanel setup. </p>

<p>olafnes is an enhanced unofficial continuation of the basicnes 2000 project (as of version 1.5 level 1), a nintendo entertainment system emulator by don jarrett, david finch, and tobias strömstedt. the majority of source code in olafnes was not written by me, therefore i take no credit for the appropriate portions. however, all additions/alterations to the source code of basicnes 2000 v1.5 level 1 are entirely by me (unless stated otherwise) in olafnes. </p>

<p>the original set of releases of olafnes were based on basicnes 2000 v1.5 level 2, but i have since moved to v1.5 level 1. this release was much faster on older pcs, and i fixed it up to have the best of original olafnes releases and v1.5 level 2. these releases won&#39;t appear too different from the original set of releases, but it&#39;s all &quot;under-the-hood&quot; work and menu changes basically.   </p>

 summary : <p>Project Name : GeekStation  Main Ideas : New SW Development Life Cycle “Learn-Code-Test-Share-Learn&quot; </p>

<p>Market Research : Code Factories (e.g. Microsoft DSL), Code Search and Repositories (GOOGLE, SDN, KRUGLE) </p>

<p>Concept : ECR - Enterprise Code Repository </p>

<p>Author : Bhuwan Lodha, Sachit Aggarwal </p>

<p>Summary </p>

<p>Lots of developers learn new stuff via searching code on web or via tutorial. They download this code, use it, as it is or make modifications and then use it. For using this code, people usually download jars of there applications and its hard to use them without performing set class-path and other environment settings. I wish I can just get a jar and document and sample code for what I want …. I wish </p>

<p>Another thing which I wished was – a moms inside computer, so that she can clean up my comp daily (throw of junk , keep all useful stuff safely somewhere ) </p>

<p>Keeping all these wishes in mind and looking forward we were triggered by our geek mind to develop some genie for us to grant these wishes </p>

<p>We give them a workbench, divided in to different zones and special tasks </p>

<p>Different Components </p>

<p>1. Code Repository /Code Catalogue / Discover Code </p>

<p>To share code snippets, we already have Google code share, Krugle or SDN. 
<br/>o This is different in the sense Code with metadata 
<br/>o Tools to upload data and validation of if something similar exist. 
<br/>o Evolve/Update Existing Data 
<br/>Pointers to access code from Google etc via web services also planned 
<br/>Provide feeds (notifications) for same 
<br/>o New Code Pieces available 
<br/>o People can see what code pieces others want 
<br/>if they have it -&gt; they can upload (Implement Code) 2.if they know how to do it but no time  
<br/>-&gt; can upload algorithm and others can pick up same (Design Code) </p>

<p>2. Test Infrastructure / Validate Application </p>

<p>We deploy our new applications, prototypes (like command line client on web, Syndicate) here - web applications as war and standalone using Java Web Start so that customers can download 
<br/>e.g.: for command line client - if it had already had swing UI o you give jars in a folder         
<br/>o application signs them and also create a JNLP file  
<br/>- editor to edit properties if needed , puts a link for same on a webpage </p>

<p>3. Learn / Use </p>

<p>Search Search code using existing tools like - Google, and Krugle Eclipse like Search (for class, method, web service, and bean) in code repository Analyze De-compiler on the web, decompile your jars using de-compiler   Analyzer - Code Analyzer on web, work with different UML diagrams for your code  - class diagram etc third party tools or services </p>

<p>Share After search if you found anything useful, you can perform following Get source compile and use it Download jar add reference to it If its web component - user can deploy it on this server and use it / / Advantages : Online tools for code analysis, store and search code online from anywhere </p>

 title : The some-chess Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Some Chess was written by Jon Link in PHP using a MySql database as a backbone. Because it uses only PHP it is accessible even to the folks without java or javascript access. It was designed so that my friends and myself could play chess together from anywhere. The idea is that it is a closed system, meaning that the only way into it is by invite, that way it stays friendly.</p>

<p>Installation is simple though you do need PHP and a MySQL database. All you have to do to install Some Chess is edit the config file and create the tables using the supplied MySQL file and then upload the Some Chess folder.</p>

 summary : <p>TapBot is an open source platform for the development and delivery of interactive story in the Metaverse. An emerging form of entertainment, interactive story enables the player to take on the role of the protagonist in a story. Where video games are built around challenging one&#39;s motor skills, interactive story can be as varied as stories themselves. Still an evolving medium, TapBot tries not to get in the way of the artist but supply them with the tools necessary to create interactive story. Think of TapBot as the film projector of the future.</p>

Originally from hacking source and created by user known as tomch, this project is now currently looking for more users and supporters and instead of depending on a forum that may eventually go down, it is being hosted here. This is a MaNGOS based repack for World of Warcraft private servers.  It is not restricted to using just MaNGOS, however the author is using it because it is more stable.  Until more development can be made, MaNGOS will be used. </p>

<p>note The tompack releases are NOT in the downloads section of this webpage.  They are not hosted on google because of the size restrictions.  So dont go looking in the downloads section for a tompack release.  To find the latest release, check in the links section.  That would be to the right ---&gt;  That is on this page.  There you will find some links and the latest release.  Also, if you want a previous version, check the bottom of this page. </p>

<p>currently supporting client 2.4.3NewsTompack 5.00(2) beta (10/10/08) </p>

<p>Sorry its been a while.  Well today is the day I officially release the beta that supports the 2.4.3 client.  Its about time, I know.  I have been very busy and sometimes just lazy.  Sorry for the wait.  More info in the installer.  Unfortunately its been so long that I forgot I had an incremental patch and a beta out, so this version patches from the latest full (4.97) to 5.00(2) beta.  I would imagine that it would work with 4.99 and 5.00 patches, although it is not completely supported and not known to be bug free.  Other than that, this should be pretty good and pretty stable and stuff so have fun. </p>

<p>Tompack 5.00 (4/27/08) </p>

<p>Tompack 5.00 has been released today.  Is being released as an incremental patch from 4.99 to 5.00, so if you have 4.97 (the last stable full install release) install 4.99 beta first, then install 5.00.  This is currently beta, but it should still work fine.  This adds support for version 2.4.1 and adds parts of the new instances and several DB fixes. </p>

<p>    * Added Isle of Quel&#39;Danas -zone in the northern Eastern Kingdoms. Only phase2 spawns have been added for now.
<br/>    * Added Arena Tournament as a game event (active the event if you wish to use arena tournament)
<br/>    * Added Magister&#39;s Terrace -instance (normal).
<br/>    * Added new 2.4 related mobs and NPCs to Outland
<br/>    * Many loot changes and additions related to 2.4
<br/>    * Loot added for fishing holes (fishing from type 25 game objects)
<br/>    * Started world drop tables level 60-70 done ~15% reduction in creature loot template size (from ~909k to ~787k entries)
<br/>    * Added many many new creature-, quest-, item- and npc_text-templates
<br/>    * Also thousands of updates for old templates
<br/>    * Quests for new area setup as if phase 4 was complete
<br/>    * Trainer updates for the new 2.4 spell system
<br/>    * Lots of random stuff and some fixes from forums, thanks to all contributors!
<br/>    * SD2 up to 350 (nothing new though)
<br/>    * Added forgotten gossip texts in Scholomance
<br/>    * Even more trainer spell updates for 2.4
<br/>    * More tweaking related to 2.4; scales, item bagfamilies, trigger hiding and so on
<br/>    * Updated partially lost arena tournament event info and changed Vashj&#39;s loots + similar fixes
<br/>    * And of course random thingsTompack 4.99 beta (4/21/08) </p>

<p>The tompack 4.99 beta has been released today.  I didn&#39;t get time to test it much, but as far as I can tell it works alright. </p>

<p>New in this beta is a simple front end.  This is to make easy start up to the server by adding a few simple commands to one window.  Start mysql, start server, and shutdown mysql.  I will probably add shutdown server later and I hope to make a pretty GUI interface later, but don&#39;t count on it. </p>

<p>Also new is UDB 0.10.0 and mangos 5650 and ScriptDev2 rev 344. Nothing too major, just a couple daemon and database updates and the new addition of the front end.  Please note that this is just a beta, so don&#39;t expect too much. </p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE: Due to the confluence of a few factors: </p>

<p>1) Major project started on a website of mine. 2) Lack of developer interest expressed in product. 3) Lack of user interest expressed in product. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken this project off of my list of current projects. </p>

<p>In a phrase: lets you have a souped up UI without breaking anything (hopefully fixing stuff!). See the wiki page for more detail on project scope. </p>

<p>In this chart, CustomUI exists as &quot;any CustomAPI-only addon&quot; with a note to other developers to consider strongly deriving from it instead of from the default UI. CustomUI is coded to provide the intended behavior of default UI, with some limited additional exposed API (not existing in default) that will be useful to other modders in further customization of the API. </p>

<p>Requires LibCustomAPI, a standalone library that manages function hooks in Warhammer&#39;s API. And here&#39;s the pretty chart. </p>

<br/>           * unsafe mode (enable and let it wreak havoc if it may)
<br/>   (user must find the setting &quot;always run in unsafe mode&quot; for state on reload)

 summary : <p>Xerblin is a completely general Human-Computer interface. </p>

<p>It provides a single metaphor for interacting with computers that is simple enough to teach to children or the elderly yet provides facilities that are useful to advanced programmers.  It can integrate all levels of software from the Desktop to assembly language. </p>

<p>Basic Design (Level 0)There are three basic user-facing elements to a Xerblin system. </p>

<p>Stack - a place to put objects for user manipulation.  This is similar to a Clipboard, however more than one item can be on it at a time and ExecutableWords (see below) operate on the items on the Stack by convention. Dictionary - a place to store ExecutableWords. Any word that is Inscribed into the Dictionary can be executed from the user interface. Interpreter - A very simple command interpreter that takes care of running executed words on the Stack.  It resembles a Forth interpreter. In addition to the above three UI elements there are discrete commands called ExecutableWords that provide the basic functionality of the system and can be composed into more complex commands. </p>

<p> ExecutableWords - The basic units of functionality in Xerblin, these live in the Dictionary and act upon the Stack.  They can be composed into compound commands using four primal relations. The builtin ExecutableWords can be composed into compound commands using the following four primal relations. </p>

<p>Sequence - do one thing after another. Loop - do something over again. Branch - do one thing or another. Parallel - do two things that don&#39;t conflict. Using the above four relations, compound commands can be composed that perform more involved tasks using built-in or user-provided &quot;primitive&quot; ExecutableWords and other compound commands.  This composition can be done by program, by command line, in the GUI using the mouse and keyboard, or by means of parsing languages. </p>

<p>With a rich set of basic Executable Words and the four kinds of Compound Executable Words you have a completely general computer interface that allows for extreme customization and great flexibility yet can be understood by the average user. </p>

<p>Additionally, any program written in any computer language can be decomposed into this format, allowing the more advanced user several interesting possibilities for program development in Xerblin. </p>

<p>GUI Interface (Level 1) See Screenshots </p>

<p>On top of this simple, elegant, extremely efficient model of computer programs there are several kinds of User Interface. </p>

<p>here is a Command-Line Interface that allows for textual input and output including scripting. There is a text-based GUI that has several very useful features. There is a Listbox that provides an interactive graphical model of the Xerblin Words, and Lists (for instance the Stack itself) and permits direct-manipulation interaction. </p>

<p>(And there is also a 3D Environment that allows for several sophisticated methods of interaction and design, but it&#39;s not going to be ready for the &quot;1.0&quot; release.) </p>

<p>Each of these different interfaces access and control the same Xerblin environment, and it is perfectly alright to use them interchangeably as their strengths and weaknesses indicate, so that you might use the Text interface to author a script which is then sent to the Xerblin Interpreter via the command line interface for execution. </p>

<p>The architecture of the Xerblin system consists of a main, central Xerblin Interpreter wherein the Executable Words and environment of the system reside, and a set of client windows that provide the different aforementioned interfaces to the interpreter.  </p>

<p>The complete state of the system can be saved to a file or stream at any time, and then reloaded later or on another machine. This, with a little help from a versioning filesystem (such as provided by Subversion or GIT) permits a sort of time independence. One can go back in time, as it were, to previously saved states of the Xerblin environment and reload them, just like many video games have the capacity to save and reload games. </p>

<p>The proof-of-concept demo version of Xerblin is written in Python and is available for download. It currently contains a the Xerblin code and a script &quot;xerblin&quot; that starts with a Text-based Interface with a Guide loaded as well as a ListBox viewer to visualize the Xerblin Stack.</p>

Alaia can perform different kinds of aggregation on the individual values in mbeans in the nodes, enabling a logical cluster view for monitoring. For managing, Alaia enables an operation to be executed across all nodes in a cluster. By using Alaia, simple non-cluster aware JMX consoles can be used to monitor and manage a cluster. In addition, Alaia performs another important function: caching. Frequent access to mbeans in a component has performance implications, especially if there are many clients. Alaia acts as a single point of access for multiple clients looking across the cluster, and a configurable cache to manage the load on the underlying components.</p>

 title : The apachetop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a console-based (non-gui) monitoring tool which reads the server-status pages from one or more Apache servers and combines the information onto one easy monitoring screen. It displays the current number of reads, writes, keepalives etc, plus the overall number of requests/hits processed, the amount of data transferred, the number of requests &amp; data processed per second since the Apache servers were started, and the &#39;current&#39; per second numbers. </p>

<p>It is useful for overall benchmarking of your Apache servers, especially in a load-balanced environment, as well as monitoring how well your servers are coping with the load and what pages are being served at any one time.</p>

 title : The broadway-monitor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project BroadwayProject Broadway is an extensible and customizable monitoring API.  Broadway lets developers easily create monitor components to observe pre-defined conditions and specify how to react when these conditions are encountered.   </p>

<p>At its core, Broadway lets developers separate the monitoring concerns from the observed resources.  It has a  flexible design,   which allows it to work in any context where JavaBean-style getter property values can be read either directly through in-VM method invocation or through some detached mechanism (i.e. proxy, reflection, rmi, jmx, web service, etc).  Broadway&#39;s simplified design offers two major high level components: a Monitor and an Action components.  The Monitor lets you specify the resources to monitor and an expression (default expression language is Groovy) used to monitor these resources .  The Action component specifies the action to execute when a specified monitored states are realized at a given time. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Broadway OffersEasy to learn non-invasive API. Maintains clean separation between monitors and monitored resources. Simplified design to allow maximum flexibility by API user. High level components such as monitors and actions use sensible defaults. Ability to monitor both in-VM and distributed resources. API with rich level of programmability through a monitor DSL. Support for programmability through dependency injection (i.e. Spring Framework, etc) Support for native JMX integration using Monitor and Action MBeans. Leverages existing frameworks including JavaBean, JMX, Java scripting, Apache BSF, etc. Support expressive monitoring rules using scripting language (default is Groovy) Create compound monitoring expressions to observe multiple resources which can be in different contexts. Architecture allows plug-in of different scripting engines supported Apache BSF (default is Groovy). Scripted action components to execute script files to handle monitoring action when monitored conditions are realized. Ready to Get Started ?Here are few links to get you Started with Broadway </p>

 title : The camur-ii Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Camur II Server </p>

<p>Camur II is a distributed data logger system designed for measurements in concrete. It is a scalable system. You will find cost-effective solutions for systems with few sensors installed in a small area or systems with hundreds of sensors spread over several hundred meters. </p>

<p>Starting in the measuring point the Camur II node connects your analog sensor to the Camur II Bus. Different kinds of sensors need different kinds of signal conditioning, consequently there are several types of Camur II nodes. For example the Camur II P-node is designed to measure the potential between a reference electrode and the rebar. Camur II LPR-node is designed to perform LPR measurement connected to rebar, reference- and counter electrode. The Camur II Bus connects all your Camur II nodes with a Camur II Controller. The Camur II Bus consists of a power- and a CAN-bus cable. Observe that you only need one set of cables to connect all your nodes to the Camur II Controller. The Camur II Bus need only pass the measurement points in the shortest way. </p>

<p>The Camur II Server software is the supervisor of the Camur II installation and runs on the Camur II Controller hardware. It is responsible for the configuration of the system. It collects and stores the data from your sensors, sets alarms and logs all important events in the system. Finally you need the user interface. The Camur II Monitor software runs directly on the Camur II Controller or on a remote PC.</p>

 title : The cattleprod Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Description </p>

<p>CattleProd is an addon to automatically search a battleground for AFK players and report them using the ReportPlayerIsPVPAFK function added in the 2.2 release. </p>

<p>Download </p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/cattleprod/ http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/9811/ http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7682-CattleProd.html Features </p>

<p>Automatic reporting of AFK players (skips already debuffed players) Manually announce AFK players to battleground chat A high level of configuration to influence the effort calculation Output levels determine how much reporting is shown to user Alterac Valley: Detect Defenders, Reward Assault and Defense of nodes Arathi Basin: Detect Defenders, Reward Assault and Defense of nodes Eye of the Storm: Detect Defenders, Reward Flag Captures Details </p>

<p>CattleProd calculates an effort score for each player of your faction in the a battleground by evaluating a player&#39;s damage, heal, battleground specific score board data, and player defensive locations.  The effort score takes into account the recent performance of the player.  The player&#39;s effort score is then compared to the average effort score for the battleground to determine if a player is AFK and then reported. </p>

<p>Install </p>

<p>Extract CattleProd.zip to World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons Upgrades require clicking the &quot;Defaults&quot; button on the Configuration Use </p>

<p>/cpconf - Bring up the configuration screen /cpherd - Scan battleground for AFK players /cpdefend - Let you know your location and your defensive status </p>

<p>General Configuration </p>

<p>Report Players AFK With this option enabled player&#39;s who are considered AFK will be have ReportPlayerIsPVPAFK called which will report the player as AFK.  When Report Players AFK is disabled players will not be reported, but will still have output printed that the players are AFK. </p>

<p>Required Effort Percentage A player whose effort is below the average effort by this percentage or less will be considered AFK. </p>

<p>Report Known Leeches Report known leeches at the start of the battleground.  This will occur at 90 seconds from when a player joins the battleground.  This allows time for the battleground to fill up. </p>

<p>Known Leech Count Only leeches who have a zero effort score throughout an entire battleground will be added to the known leech list.  Each match that they are with zero effort scores their count will be incremented.  Someone is considered a known leech after this many occurrences. </p>

<p>Report Level The report level determines the amount of output CattleProd generates for the player.   </p>

<p>0: No reports will be shown at all for the user.  Note, a player will still see the reports output from the ReportPlayerIsPVPAFK() since the 2.3 patch. </p>

<p>1 - 3: Level 1 will be a very small amount of information, just the current identified leeching players will have their data printed.  Level 3 will produce a considerable amount of detailed output. </p>

<p>Monitor Configuration </p>

<p>Auto Start Monitor Enable the monitor to automatically start when you enter a battleground and automatically turn off when leaving a battleground. </p>

<p>NOTE: Auto Start Monitor only works in Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin and Eye of the Storm.  Once battleground specific support for Warsong Gulch are added this setting will affect that battlegrounds also. </p>

<p>Display Monitor The visible frame of the monitor can be turned off with this option.  Players will still be reported as normal. </p>

<p>Monitor Duration When the monitor is enabled it will report players at the end of the duration.  Keep this number reasonable as the number of reports allowed per time frame is limited so only the worst offenders should be reported. </p>

<p>http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1777966066&amp;postId=20007202120&amp;sid=1#5 </p>

<p>Calculate Player State Interval Player state is calculated each interval.  The shorter the interval the more accurate the defense calculation will be for players.  However this also increases the CPU usage and bandwidth requirements, though no slow down is noticeable with the default setting. </p>

<p>Required Data Points A player score will not be evaluated for effort until the required number of data points have been calculated.  If the value is too small players will be potentially reported on route back to the battle since travel takes time.  If the value is too large players will be able to evade being marked AFK if they only play in spurts.  The larger the value the more memory used, though the default setting has not shown to use that much memory. </p>

<p>Announce Top N Leechers Only the top N leechers will be reported to the battleground when you click the report button on the monitor frame.  Keep this number reasonable or you might be reported for spamming. </p>

<p>Alterac Valley Configuration </p>

<p>AV Graveyard Assaulted Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have assaulted a graveyard. </p>

<p>AV Graveyard Defended Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have defended a graveyard. </p>

<p>AV Tower Assaulted Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have assaulted a tower/bunker. </p>

<p>AV Tower Defended Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have defended a tower/bunker. </p>

<p>AV Defender Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount per minute when they are defending a node. </p>

<p>Arathi Basin Configuration </p>

<p>AB Defender Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount per minute when they are defending a node. </p>

<p>AB Bases Assaulted Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have assaulted a base. </p>

<p>AB Bases Defended Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount when they have defended a base. </p>

<p>Eye of the Storm </p>

<p>EotS Defender Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount per minute when they are defending a node.  Also while a character is in the middle near the flag spawn they will receive bonus effort. </p>

<p>Flags Captured Bonus Effort A player&#39;s effort score will be adjusted by this amount for each flag capture.</p>
 title : The check-bandwidth Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Many servers and devices today have multiple connection as standard, which (and especially) through bonding means that just monitoring a single port is not always enough. </p>

<p>Originally based on the check_traffic and check_snmp_cisco_ifstatus, the originally check_bandwidth plugin was a re-write, using the Net::SNMP library, taking the best bits of both to create something I needed, as neither of the packages supported the correct feature set I required. </p>

<p>Today, check-bandwidth is again a complete re-write of the original program, but this time I&#39;ve re-written it to support extra features and the ability to monitor multiple interfaces across multiple devices, even if they&#39;re all using different connection protocols, communities and access privileges!</p>
 title : The ci-factory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of this project is to provide a working Continuous Integration Server to a client in just a few minutes.

 title : The desktopagent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Desktop Agent is a concept that is by far not original, but I haven&#39;t seen many good free implementations written in Java, so this is my attempt.  Basically, the idea is to create something that allows you to create sub-agents or bots that collect information for you.  You can make the agent persist on the desktop or hide somewhere, and you can customize it in many ways.  The Desktop Agent will act as a sort of framework used to create these sub-agents and will control them and launch them. </p>

<p>For now the desktop agent will use a non-plugin architecture, or a static architecture. </p>

<p>Two sub agent types that I want to create are </p>

<p>Web Scraper - which makes it possible to go out onto the Internet and constantly watch a certain attribute, phrase, or whatever. Filesystem Notifier - which makes it possible to watch a certain directory or file to see if it changes or if something new appears there.</p>
 title : The dhcpthief Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This tool scans periodically the network and gathers information about the neighbors, like MAC address, host name, and other informations significant for defining a host in a network. </p>

<p>The plan is to use this information to fool others that are trying to monitor the network.  </p>

<p>When scanning, the tool (almost) always finds an offline host to impersonate, using the information gathered priorly.  </p>

<p>To the DHCP server, the hosts are the same, and also for various network monitoring tools. </p>

<p>The project is made in plain old Win32 API, using SQLite. </p>

<p>CAUTION: Study carefully the policy for the network your host &quot;lives&quot; in. Contact the administrator of the network before using this software. The use of this software can cause the user some legal issues. The developer of this software does not hold any responsibility for any incidents some users may have to deal with.

 title : The dnsbalancer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The dnsbalancer is a set of java programs for load distribution and node management in a dynamic Grid (i.e. AWS EC2). DNS balancer uses DNS to distribute the load amongst nodes. It can make session replication in a cluster (often encountered with application servers, e.g. JBoss) obsolete because it records the client&#39;s IP address and will always forward a particular client to the same server.  </p>

<p>It currently works with PowerDNS, a powerful yet easily configured nameserver.  </p>

<p>The load balancing director communicates with the backend processes via RMI. Scripts are included that run on the nodes and can propagate address changes of the nodes to the director. </p>

<p>The NS entries can be read from a XML file and the load balanced records can be obtained from a database. Currently, MySQL is used, but of course this is easy to change and if time allows hibernate might be used as O-R mapping.  </p>

<p>Currently, there are some tools that allow to administer the Director via RMI. </p>

<p>Planned extensions are a monitoring component and a resource allocation component that can add and remove resources as they become neccessary or obsolete ad-hoc. </p>

 title : The ehmem Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A deep ehcache and memcached integration with looking into performance and heavy load. </p>

<p>I hope in future releases it will be part of ehcache trunk. </p>

<p>Why ehcache?Why memcached?Why &#39;JSE 5 only&#39;?We are looking into the future and always trying to take maximum from platforms and technologies. If you still on version 1.4 - when you could change your WebSphere to something better :) </p>

<p>What about performance?http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2007/05/comparing_memca.html </p>

<p>This is good comparison but it based on wrong idea - all caches must be equal. </p>

<p>For example, we have two servers with eight-core processors each for handling web requests and only 8 Gb of memory. But we could buy some cheap servers with huge amount of memory for shared memory cache. And in this case &#39;standard&#39; ehcache with replicated memory will be useless. </p>

<p>Much more close to ideal solution for utilizing resources is Coherence. But it characterized with resource wasting (-Xmx512M for JVM is not 512M for cache store) and permanent network activity for discovering nodes and in-process communications. </p>

<p>Memcached is tested, fast and solid solution for storing objects in memory and it could be great extension for ehcache. One part of this project is &#39;performance framework&#39; for testing caching efficiency and timings. </p>

<p>With Erly-Threads I mean to provide a .NET 2 library that will provide the same concurrency features.</p>

<p>The idea behind this is that threads communicate with Serializable messages instead of with memory sharing techniques. Therefore no synchronization primitives need to be used since no memory is shared, ie, no memory corruption, deadlocks and so on.</p>

 title : The gpaharenko Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This projects of Gleb Pakharenko, </p>
 summary : <p>Grouter is a message service bus that can be used to read data and write data to and from different endpoints. An endpoint can be of type file, ftp, http etc. One Grouter instance holds a set of nodes which act as scheduled workers independently from each other. A node can be configured to transform input fom one endpoint into another format on the output endpoint using a plugins. Further more a Grouter instance might be part of a set of Grouter instances in an application domain, which helps to scale up the message service bus within an enterpise environment. In the simplest use case scenario one Grouter instance runs as a single service on a network node as a Java process. Monitoring is done through log4j log files. In a second use case scenario a web application - Gweb - can be installed into a JEE container and thereby get easier monitoring and managing of nodes, users and jobs for the Grouter.</p>

 title : The hackstop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The problem: Only a tiny fraction of hacking attempts are ever reported, only a small number of those are traced and very few hackers are ever caught. Amateur hackers need to be detered from following a life of net crime.</p>

<p>The solution: Get more incidents reported and capture the evidence required to persue action against the hacker.</p>

<p>How hackstop helps: It monitors the entry point (in future points) and identifies suspiscious activity. When that activity passes a certain thresholds it reports the activity via email and takes steps to prevent further hacking attempts.
<br/>It is designed for SME organisations, i.e. the ones who have a simple VPN or remote access point - but no budget for a full blown security team.</p>

<p>&#39;You wouldn&#39;t let somone come up to your house every night and try 500 keys in the door without reporting it.&#39;</p>

<p>Status:</p>

<p>Alpha level code, but in production use</p>

<p>Current Functionality:</p>

<p>Operating Systems: Fedora Core 4&amp;5, but should work on most Linux distros.
<br/>Monitors /var/log/secure
<br/>Identifies both long running and short burst attacks.
<br/>Distinct reporting and banning thresholds
<br/>WARNING: Updates /etc/hosts.deny
<br/>Report includes accurate timestamping and attack history data.
<br/>Avoids double reporting.</p>

<p>Roadmap:</p>

<p>Monitor for other types of hacking
<br/>Use of database rather than in-memory recording of events
<br/>Addition of post attack followup report with raw log extracts
<br/>Proper init.d start/stop scripts
<br/>Externalisation (&amp; i18n) of report template
<br/>Integration with firewall controls</p>

<p>Installation Instructions (Linux):</p>

<p>1. Download hackstop.pl and put it into your favoutite place for security scripts (e.g. /usr/sbin). Make sure it is secure.
<br/>2. Check that you have the following perl modules available on your system: Unix::PID and File::Tail::App; if not install them (fyi &#39;perl -MCPAN -e shell&#39;)
<br/>3. Edit the parameters at the top of the script. You will need to set the abuse and your admin email address. Also your contact details and ip address. Feel free to adjust the thresholds.
<br/>4. IMPORTANT You should agree with your isp or whoever the abuse email will go to that they will accept it and do something with it.
<br/>5. Add the following line to your /etc/rc.local (or equivalent)
<br/>nohup /my/chosen/path/hackstop.pl &gt;&gt; /var/log/hackstop.log &amp;
<br/>6. Run the same command from the command line as root to start it.</p>

<p>Testing:</p>

<p>Start with an internal abuse email address until you are happy with the reporting.
<br/>You can also change the monitored file to be something like &#39;/root/test.log&#39; and then inject previous logs into that test file (&#39;cat /var/log/secure.2 &gt;&gt; /root/test.log&#39;) to see how the script handles them.</p>

<p>hacktop vs. DenyHosts</p>

<p>DenyHosts is a more high tech solution, with an established history of managing to &quot;proactively thwart attacks&quot;. hackstop is orientated towards reporting the problem, and only stops the attack later. The two projects do the same job, hackstop exists because thwarting the hacker is not enough.</p>

<p>Note on reporting abuse:</p>

<p>There is no central location for reporting hacking attempts (yet). You could contact the abuse@ of the hacking source, but that takes time and effort to track down. The best place to report it to is your own ISP abuse email, who usually will be aware of attacks against multiple targets from one source and can aggregate information. But you must talk to them first to check that they will accept it.</p>

<p>If you improve on it them please feel free to contribute that back to the community.</p>

 title : The jbehave-junit-monitor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When you run a JBehave scenario you do not get very good monitoring of your test progress. This code will allow you to see each individual step being executed as part of your scenario, as if it were an individual test case. It is stretching the metaphor a little bit, but I personally like the results... </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This code was produced to be able to sit on top of JBehave without modifying its API or internal workings at all. I&#39;m sure if it was integrated into the API, and a few refactorings were made the solution could be a little more elegant. </p>

<p>For an example of how to integrate with your JBehave scenario&#39;s look at ExampleScenario in the test directory </p>

<p>Further work I have planned to try, is to update various JUnit runners (specifically the eclipse one) so that they can map directly to the correct step in the code. This currently does not work because the steps are not named as per the step method that is called. </p>

<p>  PS. This code will fall over in a heap if you do not call it in a single threaded fashion.  I&#39;ve made a huge assumption that most test runners are single threaded.</p>

<p>//&gt; S3Object &quot;Other File.txt&quot;What&#39;s really cool about these examples is that LitS3 is managing memory very efficiently for you. The S3Service.ForEach… methods use callbacks to ensure that the actual web requests happen transparently in the background and are properly cleaned up. </p>

<p>For instance, when you call ForEachObject to list the contents of a bucket with a million objects, LitS3 will automatically handle the multiple S3 requests necessary to do this, as you iterate through each object. LitS3 will not just construct an array with a million entries! </p>

<p>Need more flexibility?Every method in S3Service is backed by a corresponding S3Request+S3Response class pair that, together, encapsulate a normal WebRequest+WebResponse. </p>

<p>This means that every S3 operation can be performed using WebRequest&#39;s asynchronous API: </p>

<p>var request = new GetObjectRequest(s3, &quot;lits3-demo&quot;, &quot;File 1.txt&quot;);</p>

<p>request.BeginGetResponse(result =&gt;
<br/>{
<br/>    // comes in on a separate thread
<br/>    using (GetObjectResponse response = request.EndGetResponse(result))
<br/>    {
<br/>        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream());
<br/>        Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());</p>

<p>        //&gt; This is file one!
<br/>    }
<br/>}, null);</p>

<p>// continues immediately without blocking...I don&#39;t see (…random S3 feature…) in S3Service, can you add it?This is where the S3Request+S3Response classes mentioned above come in. These backing classes like AddObjectRequest, GetObjectRequest, etc. expose nearly 100% of S3&#39;s API. </p>

<p>For instance, use AddObjectRequest.Metadata and GetObjectResponse.Metadata if you want to get or set S3 key-value &quot;Metadata&quot; on your objects. </p>

<p>More Code ExamplesWhat&#39;s missingDoesn&#39;t currently support get/set of non-canned ACLs Doesn&#39;t currently support get/set of server access logging Haven&#39;t looked at the BitTorrent feature yet, probably trivial</p>

 title : The nagzilla Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Nagzilla was designed to be a Jabber relay &quot;bot&quot; in that it sits quietly in a room until it gets a message to relay to either a chatroom or a person. The early work was based on several simple examples out on the internets but didn&#39;t quite meet our needs. Namely they would just keep logging into a room every time they had something to say. That forced us to make it a daemon. This also allows us to now get nagzilla alerts from various systems and event creators. Nagzillac (the client program&quot;) accepts any string input and makes into a Jabber message. This should work with Google Talk (as it&#39;s Jabber based) but that&#39;s not been tested. The only platform this has been tested on is ejabberd running on Ubuntu. I have no doubts it SHOULD work on other Jabber/Linux/Perl platforms as well.  </p>

 summary : <p>Programming Assignment 3 </p>

<p>Objective </p>

<p>The objective of this assignment is to experiment with network monitoring and to learn about IP packets. Assignment: Packet Capturing </p>

<p>Libpcap is a libray (packet capturing library) to monitor activity on a network. Tcpdump is a network debugging tool that is built using libpcap. You can find more information on the Internet, particularly the online tutorial at http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.htm should be very useful!  </p>

<p>In this assignment, you have to develop a TCP program that opens a connection from a host A (your client) to a host B (a server) at port 80. For example, the server could be www.cnn.com or www.yahoo.com, etc. The client writes 1 byte of information and closes the connection. Further, you develop a second program that uses libpcap to capture packets transmitted for this TCP transaction. Describe the details of each IPv4 packet that is part of the conversation between your client program and the remote server.  </p>

<p>To execute the packet monitoring program, you will need super-user privileges; you can get this access by using sudo program on your own Linux/Unix computer. If you do not have access to a computer where you can obtain super-user rights, you can access one of the instructor&#39;s computers. They are dartslab1-4.cse.nd.edu, the login name is &#39;compnets&#39; and the password will be distributed in class. Since you are given super-user rights, please be extremely careful, do not give away the password, and do not store any personal data on these machines. The guest account will be closed immediately after the deadline for this assignment.  </p>

<p>The programs have to show a usage explanation when a user provides the wrong (or wrong number of) parameters. The client should take hostnames (not IP addresses!) as input parameter. Submission </p>

<p>The due date for this assignment is April 3, 2008, 11am EST. You will use the drop-off boxes in the course directory (you will find a box with your login name). Make a directory called &quot;project3&quot; and place all required files into this directory (either individually or as one tar file). Only one team member has to do this! The required files are: all source files, a Makefile, and a document called README (ASCII file) or readme.ps or readme.pdf (postscript file), which describes a project summary, your solution approach, any encountered problems and how you solved them, any unresolved issues, a usage explanation, and a description of each IPv4 packet that you captured for the conversation between your client and the server (i.e., analyze the flags, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, etc). There is no page limit for this document. Make sure to provide the names of all team members on the project summary. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>

 title : The onecheck-monitoring Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Onecheck Monitor is a network and server monitoring software that reduces the complexity associated with managing an IT infrastructure, lowering the cost of ownership and improving the efficiency of IT interventions.
<br/>The software monitor optimizes the process of determining the cause of a particular IT problem and facilitates a quick resolution to the problem, dramatically reducing downtime. In this way the IT staff can spend less time managing problems and more time delivering new services.
<br/>Onecheck Monitor consists of a network monitoring service with a separate management interface. The network monitoring service uses both WMI and ADSI. WMI is an interface to a broad range of hardware and software computer objects and properties, allowing you to perform checks without using remote agents. Consequently no agent software needs to be installed on the machines you wish to monitor. The management interface relies on powerful XML Technology.
<br/>The software engine is multi-threaded and can perform multiple checks in parallel. The software architecture allows scalability for monitoring both small and medium class networks.
<br/>The State View provides a real-time look at the health of each computer within the managed environment, highlighting the systems that require attention. The Alerts View provides a list of issues requiring action.</p>

 title : The perfsonar-ps-cfg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>perfSONAR-PS is a set of independent software services that implement the perfSONAR protocols for network performance monitoring.  The targeted audience for these services is network Network Operation Centers (NOCs) at Universities and Regional networks, however these services are broadly useful to the general public at large. </p>

<p>Configuration of the independent software components that make up perfSONAR-PS can be challenging from the point of view of both design and installation of services.  Configuration should not be for experts only, and should be geared towards letting anyone easily create configuration files with minimal knowledge of structure.   </p>

<p>The perfSONAR-PS CFG effort aims to unify a plugin based architecture to configuration management.  Developers may easily specify configuration parameters in XML and use any number of skins such as CGI or command line tools to gather the necessary information and output configuration files. </p>

 title : The ps07 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The PS07 system simulates a set of parking lot paystations (four instances on the left side in the image above) that can be supervised/monitored by a set of monitor applications (two instances on the right). Each pay stations reports number of vacant parking lots as well as total earning every time a driver buys a parking ticket. This way the monitoring applications can for instance show number of vacant lots at the parking lot entrance; and a central administration can monitor if it is time to empty the pay stations, see where there are empty parking lots, etc.  </p>

<p>You should download the associate source code PS07.zip. The image above corresponds to the sc1 target in the build script. A short discussion can be found ind the Mandatory Exercise powerpoint slides.  </p>

<p>The PS07 prototype code is a single VM demonstration (but note that each Java JFrame runs in its own thread so there are actually seven threads running in this example.). Your job is to make it distributed.  More specifically, the build management system should contain targets  </p>

<p>runGUI: start a pay station GUI running its own VM on localhost (or some host).  runMonitor: start a monitor application that attaches itself to the server running.  You are allowed to hardcode the system such that it support only a single pay station gui (one server) with a fixed name but it should support running multiple monitor applications (multiple clients).  </p>

<p>It should be possible simply to refactor the system to achieve the exercise goal without changing the module structure and the interfaces, except of course where you need to delare things Remote or Serializable.  Review the provided production and test code and identify the interfaces/classes that belongs to the server and to the client. Define which interfaces/classes that needs to be passed by reference and which needs to be passed by value.  Product: A short description of the central abstractions and their classification.  </p>

<p>Rewrite the system to become distributed according to the outline you have made above. You will need to negotiate aspects like the rmic compiler and java security settings. Most of the technicalities in this is demonstrated in the ant build script of the Echo system (Echo.zip) so I advice that you review that and reuse as much as you can!)  Product: Zip with production and test code. You must provide two targets so that the TA can run a sequence like this to verify your system:  </p>

<p>start rmiregistry start ant runGUI start ant runMonitor start ant runMonitor start ant runMonitor 	   to start a pay station gui and several monitor applications.  </p>

<p>Analyze your code for concurrency issues. That is, identify the methods/classes in your system that have to be monitors/synchronized methods to work properly in the full scale scenario of 100s of pay stations and dozens of monitoring applications.  Product: An written analysis outlining which methods/regions that are critical regions and must be synchronized.</p>

 title : The scengine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SC engine (Server management system) </p>

<p>It’s true that we have difficulty of managing the suitability of server condition  building or control of management depend on business purpose. It is base on opinion that to manage free linux server would raise TCO batter than to use the cost of server OS after getting license. S.C. engine(System Control engine) offer the auto mastic management function with the direct and convenience graphic to server manager.  One  of  the most important goal is  control  at the same time in the one united environment. It’s not for the system collecting  engineering information only, but confirmation  the moving installation  and  direct data  moreover could be checked the saved information. Though monitoring  system is more simple to manage with small cost as a good point, User can edit new data  but not make a new view . As managing the error possibility of real working state and specific engineering data  during  the monitoring on the real PC in time, it works the role to protect and cure the install obstacle and incident. In the case of equipment obstacle or quality error,   to find the  reason,  bond the several useful information  and analyze trend. Finding equipment problem, it ‘s the system that can manage dividing  after-integrity period set or before- integrity. </p>

<p>Feature </p>

<p>1) User Interface  To use the linux server, you should know many things such as the words and demon name for user, user’s control. So many user suffer difficulties on this point. So we suggest End User Computing condition to make them use easily though  user don’t know  the skill of linux or server itself. </p>

<p>2) Monitoring and Auto management </p>

<p>Manager can register controlling server in the graphic base and offer the monitoring function about that server.And check the state of server’s service so, make it put the appropriate back over  during the obstacle. This  will be reported to all step user by using the user’s monitor , sounds,SMS service and so on. </p>

<p>3) Server Control </p>

<p>To make an service base using the linux server , lots of pre-information is acquired. Moreover, information over the service operation, itself should be needed to make a base of the operating server  and  to operate the server, itself, safely. Server condition setting and setup will be offered starting from well-known general service. Easier package install and condition setup , package update, wall  or safety control will proceeding automatically.   </p>

<p>4) Grouping </p>

<p>There are some cases repeating  operation about several server like a preservative issue or policy set of perspective service . This part  Is bad for effective management. Of cause, depend on the skill, there can be a condition to be able to deal with it automatically, in linux. However, people feel harsh in this part. </p>

<p>Though this project, hope that many engineer could go back home after managing easier  server. This one started from students of business information department at Keimeung Uni  
<br/>In  S.Korea who hope working for IT.  </p>

 summary : <p>This project aims at porting GCC to support the NEC SX vector CPU (SX6 - SX9). Targets of the project are: </p>

<p>Document the SX assembler instructions, scalar CPU registers and existing calling conventions by using information from existing and openly available reference guides. This step is a prerequisite for such an open source effort. Write Machine description, expander definitions and insn patterns for SX CPU. Get GCC to produce assembler code for the SX, focus on scalar instructions. </p>

<p>This project doesn&#39;t aim to produce a competitive vectorizing compiler for the SX, the knowhow for that is far too special and the effort too high. Instead it aims at a compiler producing correct scalar code, as basis for further open-source projects for the SX architecture. </p>

 title : The vmon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>vmon - Video MONitoring programTrent Zhou (trent.zhou@gmail.com) </p>

<p>This program is supposed to be a video monitoring program. Its functions shall include (not limited): </p>

<p>capture video from a webcam stream the video through a web server (via ffmpeg) do some operations against the video, such as face detecting, motion detecting... (via OpenCV) notify user when some event happens, such as when the program detects a face. The user can be notified by email, SMS...  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a clear releasing plan of this project. This is a hobby project any way... </p>

<p>Update at 2009-11-13I&#39;m now working in a company which develop devices such as PMP and IP camera. The goal of this project is more-or-less the same as IP cameras. I will update this project later when I have some new ideas :-) </p>

<p>First AttemptsSince I plan to make the program detect faces and motions, I decide to make use of OpenCV for such purpose. So the first problem is how to capture images with OpenCVand then stream it with ffmpeg. </p>

<p>Till now I managed to convert an image from opencv to ffmpeg and stream webcam in flv format through web with libavformat and libavcodec.  </p>

<p>DependenciesYou&#39;ll need following libraries and corresponding header files to compile this project if this project is released: </p>

<p>OpenCV ffmpeg Later you&#39;ll probably need FastCGI and lighttpd installed to run this program. </p>

<p>How to buildThis project is developed with Code::Blocks in Ubuntu Linux, and Microsoft Visual Studio Express in Windows. When formally released, I&#39;ll put a makefile which works in both Linux and Windows. Now I&#39;m not sure if the trunk code works in Windows or any other system. </p>

<p>Road MapRight now, the program has a simple web server built in. I believe this is not necessary. I plan to make it a full web application which is easy to deploy and serve rich features. Further steps would be: </p>

<p>Design a better architecture. Document it. Write a lighttpd module or FasgCGI program to stream webcam Find or Develop a notification mechanism. Perhaps techniques like COMET will be involved. Create a web application to manage webcam operations. The web application could be developed with Ruby On Rails of other frameworks.</p>

 summary : <p>Fusion Registry GPLIntroducing a completely dynamic, extremely powerful site registry system! Fusion Registry is designed with you in mind. Able to adjust to your sites need, you have the control to shape Fusion Registry into what you need! </p>

<p>Fusion Registry is based upon the highly successful Garage Module with many enhancements. Fusion Registry was designed with dynamics in mind, being able to suit the needs of a wide variety of audiences. </p>

<p>Item RecordsThe main tracked object in Fusion Registry is called an &#39;Item&#39;. This reflects the objects you would like users to enter into your registry. For example &#39;Vehicles&#39;, &#39;Motorcyle&#39;, &#39;ATV&#39;, etc... The details of items in the registry are completely dynamic through custom fields. If enabled, users can have a guestbook for their item, post BBCode/HTML, and upload pictures! </p>

<p>Custom FieldsAny piece of data you want to be available to users to enter information about their item is controlled by custom fields. There are no hard-coded fields, that means you can define whatever you want. The types of custom fields available to you include text fields, memo/description areas, select lists, radio buttons, check boxes, floating point numbers and some legacy built-in fields. Each custom field can be configured to be searchable, required, default values, grouped with other custom fields and ordered. </p>

<p>Custom Rating FieldsA complex ratings system is just waiting for you to enable it. You can define as many custom rating fields to allow your users to rate items in a variety of categories. </p>

<p>Custom SearchAlong with the ability to search by members you can control which custom fields are searchable. With the ability to do logic OR and AND searches this can allow your end users to find exactly what they are looking for. </p>

<p>Inline ModerationAvailable to members of a group that has super-mod privledges you can keep your registry running smoothly without having to enter into your admin control panel. You can edit, remove or add to items in the registry as if they were your own. </p>

<p>Easy IntegrationAs simple as it sounds :) No code edits are required to install Fusion Registry! Simple inserts into your portal will highlight bits from your registry, and an added button to your topic posts provides a quick method for finding users&#39; items in the registry. </p>

<p>Completely CustomizableVirtually every aspect of the registry can be customized with ease. All the language and template bits can be managed through your admin control panel. Custom fields and custom rating fields allow you infinite possibilities as to what data is tracked!</p>

<br/>&amp;nbsp;Owning garages and possibly homes/apartments.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;Player vs. Player: When cruising the current city players could opt to become a 		challenger at any time. This would allow other players to see their position 		on the 	map. Once the player is close to the challenger they would get info 		on the racer and its current vehicle.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;Car Clubs: Car clubs would form around certain car types and certain race types.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;To compete as a club, members would have to control a part of the city to race on.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;This would be set up by spraying buildings in the area the club wants. But if 		another gang sprays over the tag, they lose that section and have to face off against
<br/>&amp;nbsp;the other gang to win it back. Some car club races would be for pinkslips. 		Meaning players would lose their cars to the other team</p>

<p>BINFSea BookingBusiness caseWe willen een nieuw geautomatiseerd reserveringssysteem waarmee onze medewerkers snel en foutloos kamers kunnen boeken voor klanten. </p>

<p>ProbleemstellingTegenwoordig worden reserveringen in BINFSea nog steeds manueel gedaan en bijgehouden op papier. Klanten kunnen boeken via telefoon, e-post of aan de balie. Onze medewerkers zoeken dan geschikte vrije kamers op de gevraagde data op en geven dit aan de klanten door die dan al dan niet hun boeking kunnen bevestigen. Dit is een onflexibel systeem dat veel tijd in beslag neemt (in drukke periodes tot enkele dagen tussen aanvraag en definitieve boeking) en aanleiding geeft tot fouten zoals dubbele boekingen. Als we onze klanten niet onmiddelijk en foutloos bevestiging kunnen geven dat we op de door hun gevraagde data kamers vrij hebben, gaan ze elders op zoek naar logies en zo verliezen we inkomsten. Zolang klanten nog niet definitief geboekt hebben dienen we kamers een aantal dagen vrij te houden, met het gevaar dat we intussen andere potentiële klanten moeten weigeren. Regelmatig worden er fouten gemaakt bij het berekenen van de prijs, en dit kost ons eveneens geld. </p>

<p>Dit alles zorgt voor wrevel bij onze klanten en maakt het samenwerken met reisbureaus (die voor hun klanten reizen boeken) ingewikkelder. Het feit dat we onze klanten geen correcte en vlotte service kunnen bieden maakt dat we inkomsten verliezen en is bovendien demotiverend voor onze medewerkers. Het staat ook de verdere groei van BINFSea in de weg. </p>

<p>ProductpositioneringBINFSea Booking is een applicatie die onze medewerkers toelaat om: </p>

<p>Snel de beschikbaarheid van kamers (die aan zekere criteria voldoen zoals type, aanwezigheid van sanitair, enz.) voor een bepaalde periode op te zoeken; Snel alternatieven voor te stellen als het gevraagde type kamer niet beschikbaar is; Onmiddellijk een offerte op te stellen met de prijs voor het verblijf, incl. BTW en andere kosten en toeslagen; De prijs voor een kamer hangt af van (zie ook verder voor een prijslijst): het kamertype, de boekingsperiode (3 tarieven: laag- midden- en hoogseizoen); (optioneel) ontbijt, halfpension of volpension, elk met een eigen tarief; de (optionele) annuleringsverzekering zodat minder/geen kosten aangerekend worden bij annulering (zie verder); Er wordt na bevestiging van de reservatie een factuur opgemaakt met een detail van alle bij reservering aangerekende kosten (kamer, opties, ...) en duidelijke opgave van alle bedragen zonder BTW en aangerekende BTW, die naar de klant gestuurd kan worden (de klant dient dit bedrag vooraf te betalen; eventuele extra kosten zoals drank in de bar, huur van de garage, enz. wordt afgerekend bij het vertrek van de gasten); De kamer te boeken voor de gevraagde periode (een optie nemen op een kamer is niet voorzien); Een bepaalde reservatie te annuleren. Bij annulering worden er eventueel kosten aangerekend (zie verder); Wanneer het hotel een bepaald bedrag moet terugbetalen omwille van een annulering, dient een creditnota opgemaakt te worden met duidelijke opgave van wat de reden is van de terugbetaling; het uiteindelijk aangerekende bedrag; het reeds door de klant betaalde bedrag; het verschil tussen deze twee bedragen, i.e. het door BINFSea aan de klant terug te betalen bedrag. De applicatie zal draaien op een computer achter de balie waar enkel personeel komt. Aanmelden bij het systeem is daarom niet voorzien. </p>

<p>Niet-functionele eisenDe gebruikersinterface van de applicatie moeten in drie talen kunnen aangeboden worden (Nederlands, Frans en Engels) volgens de voorkeur van de gebruiker. De documenten voor klanten die de applicatie genereert (offertes, facturen en creditnotas) moeten in de voorkeurtaal van de klant opgesteld worden. Ook hier voorzien we Nederlands, Frans en Engels. ToekomstIn de toekomst wensen we ook het volgende te doen met BINFSea Booking: </p>

<p>Uitbreidingen van de hierboven en verder beschreven functionaliteiten. Contactgegevens van klanten beheren: toevoegen, wijzigen, verwijderen (dat laatste kan, om boekhoudkundige redenen, enkel wanneer er op naam van de klant geen openstaande facturen meer zijn en sinds de laatste vijf jaar geen facturen en/of creditnotas meer ingeboekt zijn). Koppeling aan het boekhoudsysteem voor synchornisatie klantenbestand, automatisch boeken van facturen en creditnotas, opvolgen van betalingen, enz. </p>

<p>Begrippenlijstaankomstdatum de dag dat een gast verwacht wordt aan te komen </p>

<p>boekingsperiode aaneengesloten reeks nachten waarop een kamer geboekt wordt. De periode wordt aangegeven met twee data: de aankomstdatum en de dag vóór het vertrek. Bijvoorbeeld: een gast komt aan op 1 juli en verblijft 1 nacht. De boekingsperiode is dan 1 juli tot 1 juli. Voor 3 nachten wordt dit dan 1 juli tot 3 juli. Gevolg: twee opeenvolgende boekingsperiodes hebben nooit overlappende data. </p>

<p>gast een natuurlijke persoon die de bedoeling heeft een hotelovernachting te volbrengen. </p>

<p>kamertoestand We onderscheiden volgende toestanden: </p>

<p>vrij: er hebben vorige nacht geen gasten in de kamer verbleven en er worden vandaag geen gasten verwacht; bezet: er verblijven momenteel gasten in de kamer die er de vorige nacht overnacht hebben en die de volgende nacht blijven; gasten vertrekken: de kamer is bezet, maar de gasten die er verblijven vertrekken vandaag; gastenwissel: de kamer is bezet, de gasten die er verblijven vertrekken vandaag en vannacht zullen er nieuwe gasten verblijven; gasten verwacht: de kamer is vrij, maar vandaag worden nieuwe gasten verwacht. kamertype het soort kamer: 1 persoon: er zijn geen eenpersoonskamers 2 personen: twin (2 eenpersoonsbedden), king (1 tweepersoonsbed) 3 personen: triple twin (2+1 eenpersoonsbedden), triple king (1 tweepersoonsbed, 1 eenpersoonsbed) 4 personen: quadruple twin (2+2 eenpersoonsbedden), quadruple king (1 tweepersoonsbed+2 eenpersoonsbedden) Een kamer kan al dan niet zicht op zee hebben. Dit maakt ook deel uit van het kamertype. </p>

<p>klant de natuurlijke of rechtspersoon die een contract tot hotelreservering afsluit en/of die gehouden is tot een betaling (als tegenprestatie). </p>

<p>vertrekdatum de dag dat een gast verwacht wordt te vertrekken</p>

<p>NewsGet to the choppah! (7/16/2008)I figured out how to prepare a Windows release, but instead I&#39;m going to create a wiki for Helmer and pack for my trip. </p>

<p>-DF </p>

<p>Cleanup (7/12/2008)Did a little housekeeping to move/hide all old SDL stuff. Sometime next week I will work on getting a Windows release to actually prove that we are doing something and to check out deploying an Xna project in Windows. I&#39;m sure NSIS will come to the rescue yet again :D </p>

<p>Site Update (7/10/2008)At all the excitement switching to Xna and Torque X, I figured this site needs an update. By the way, Torque X is absolutely amazing, albeit a little lacking in the free examples department. Xna is also great, especially since Game Studio 2.0. And with DreamBuildPlay 2008, we can test on the 360 right away with committing to a full creator&#39;s club account.</p>

 title : The dfo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutThe application allows online/offline mode management of your photos. You can upload, search and download photos, through the easy to use interface. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Why should you be using it?Web based organizer&#39;s are moderately slow, updates take time, you can only use it when you&#39;re online. When you have thousands of photos to organize, the time adds up. DFO on the other hand, stores all the updates offline, and with a simple and intuitive graphical interface, allows you to be way more productive. You&#39;ll never dread having to organize sets, edit titles, descriptions and tags for the hundreds or thousands of photos you&#39;ve accumulated. And you can do all this editing, when you&#39;re just trying to kill your time in train, or that long plane trip. </p>

<p>What all does it provide?Uploading and downloading of photos. You can download selected photos or the entire sets. Edit information attached to photos; delete photos from stream. Add/Remove tags associated with photos. Create new sets, edit set information, add/remove photos from sets, delete sets. New in v0.4 Add/Remove photos from Group Pools. New in v0.7 Add/Delete/Edit comments. Text search comments and their author names. New in v0.7 Post photos to blogs. New in v0.7 Easy Drag-n-drop photos from nautilus for uploading. New in v0.7 Image preview in file chooser dialog, shown when uploading photos. New in v0.7 Edit title, description, privacy and tags of photos set for uploading. New in v0.7 Allow reverting of edits done to photo. Important note regarding v0.7For all the existing users of DFO, to view the comments of your photos, you&#39;d need to delete sqlite.db file located in $HOMEDIR/.desktopflickr, and do a sync after that. DFO will repopulate photo information, and also retrieve the corresponding comments. This doesn&#39;t apply to the new users of DFO. </p>

<p>Important note regarding v0.8Fixes released in this version: </p>

<p>Instead of storing all the thumbnails and small images in a single directory, they&#39;re now sharded in subdirectories, hence avoiding the &#39;too-many-files-in-one-directory&#39; issue. The conflict resolution is only done when there&#39;re noticeable changes to the images, hence fixing &amp;nbsp;issue 13&amp;nbsp;. File extension is now extracted from information provided by flickr server, instead of defaulting to JPG. DFO crash upon entering apostrophe s (&#39;s) in set name. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re upgrading from v0.7, please delete .desktopflickr directory located in $HOME_DIR. This would prompt DFO to re-download the thumbnails and small images to a new directory structure. </p>

<p>InstallationCurrently, DFO is only available for Gnome. To install it on Ubuntu Feisty Fawn, follow these instructions: </p>

<p>Command Linesudo apt-get install mono libmono-sqlite2.0-cil libgconf2.0-cil gtk-sharp2 Download Desktop Flickr Organizer files from the &#39;Downloads&#39; section, and execute &#39;sh run.sh&#39;. That&#39;s it! Graphical InterfaceFire up Synaptics. Install Mono CLI (.NET) runtime. The current latest version is v1.2.3.1 Install Mono Sqlite library version 2.0. The package version is v1.2.3.1 Install CLI binding for GConf 2.16. The package version is v2.16.0 Install CLI binding for Gtk# 2.10. The current package version is v2.10.0 Download Desktop Flickr Organizer files from the &#39;Downloads&#39; section, and execute &#39;sh run.sh&#39;. Other distros would also work the same way, once you have installed the Mono libraries. </p>

<p>Note: DFO has been included in debian packages, so to install it in debian, all you need to do is to run &#39;sudo apt-get install dfo&#39;. </p>

<p>Known IssuesDFO doesn&#39;t show the photos uploaded, while I can see them on the flickr web interface. The reason they don&#39;t show up is instantaneously is because of flickr apis&#39; responses slowness. They take easily upto half an hour to catch up with updates. Especially new uploaded photos can even take more than that, to show up in the &#39;retrieve stream&#39; api. The edits done to photos, may also show similar glitches, but give it enough time, and it would show you the expected results. If you can see it on flickr web interface, DFO will catch up with the changes. </p>

 title : The digitalfactory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Digital FactoryEs el code name del proyecto que presentaremos como tesis de Analista de  Sistemas de la Universidad Tecnologica Nacional. El presente proyecto tiene por objetivo llevar adelante el desarrollo de un sistema informático que soporte las actividades operativas, técnicas y gerenciales que se llevan a cabo en el frigorífico “LA ESTANCIA”, destinado a la producción y comercialización de embutidos. </p>

<p>El desarrollo estará organizado en diferentes etapas, a través de las cuales se facilitara su seguimiento, posibilitando hacer visibles y verificables los resultados y avances. En primera instancia, realizaremos una presentación organizacional de la empresa, una descripción general de su funcionamiento actual, un análisis del sistema de información actualmente en uso y un diagnóstico de los problemas detectados en los procesos administrativos para el manejo de datos del negocio, a partir de lo cual, detallaremos un conjuntos de requerimientos propuestos para el nuevo sistemas de información(actividad llevada a cabo conjuntamente con cliente) con el objeto de establecer las capacidades y definir los limites para el desarrollo del nuevo sistema. </p>

<p>Seguidamente, surge nuestra propuesta para el nuevo  sistema de información, en la que especificamos cuales serán sus objetivos, limites y alcances. Además de ello, también se definen las restricciones que al desarrollo de este sistema se le presentan y se adjunta el estudio de la viabilidad de la propuesta. </p>

<p>A continuación, aplicando la metodología orientada a  objetos, entraremos de lleno en el Proceso Unificado de Desarrollo de Software utilizando con ello el lenguaje de Modelado Unificado. </p>

<p>Planificando actividades y detallando documentación, se procederá a realizar inicialmente las etapas correspondientes al análisis y al diseño del sistema de información, para dar lugar finalmente a las etapas de implementación y Prueba con lo que quedara compuesto el sistema en su totalidad quedando apto para su utilización. </p>

 title : The flashbsm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The FlashbsmThe flashbsm is a settings manager for the compiz window manager (especially when compiz-fusion is installed alongside it). (information about compiz/compiz-fusion can be found over at wiki.compiz-fusion.org. </p>

<p>Flashbsm is written in actionscript 3 and mxml, using the flex framework. Then, to communicate with compiz so that settings can actually be changed, a python server is used along with pyamf (http://pyamf.org/) so that I can talk to the python server from the flashbsm. </p>

<p>Please note however, that since the beginning of this project, I have mainly made this just to mess around and familiarise myself with actionscript, so if you end up looking at the code, excuse the mess that it is :) . </p>

<p>HistoryBack in the days of beryl (compiz itself has a very colourful history. Without going much into it, there used to be a fork to compiz called beryl, which eventually merged back with compiz, beginning the days of compiz-fusion) we had a fairly horrible settings manager. </p>

<p>So a person called Franzrogar and myself started making some mockups for a new settings manager (I&#39;m not sure who started first, but it was around the same time). Unfortunately we lost the forum where that thread was originally posted and earliest I can find is this http://forum.beryl-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=1249. </p>

<p>Eventually Franzrogar&#39;s mockup ended up being used for the “bsm” (beryl settings manager).  </p>

<p>Mine however, which was originally made in the flash 8 ide (oh it was horrible :)) was very similar to the franzrogar&#39;s mockup but it had a few more features than his that couldn&#39;t really be converted to the real thing anyways. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested to have a look, this is what I have left from that time http://delfick.storage.googlepages.com/bsmMockups.tar.gz (unfortunately my harddrive died a few years ago and I didn&#39;t have many backups of anything :() </p>

<p>Anyway, even after the bsm was made I continued to work on my mockup, eventually deciding to use it to figure out how to use actionscript. After many months I ended up with a .fla file that had nothing on the stage, but just actionscript that drew and operated the entire thing. It was around this time that it was suggested that I start to use actionscript 3 (http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showpost.php?p=7399&amp;postcount=32) (April 2007) so that I didn&#39;t have to rely on the flash ide and so anyone would be able to help make it. I decided not to go to actionscript 3 at that time, and instead found a way of making it completely in actionscript 2, along with the help of kagswf (http://kagswf.tensus.net/). </p>

<p>Then cws was created by one of the key members of the compiz community, mikedee ( http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=753&amp;highlight=cws (that thread was originally in compiz.org and didn&#39;t merge to well when it was put into the compiz-fusion forums). Which I started to use to be able to edit settings (http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=760). Unfortunately it was very cumbersome and din&#39;t end up working. Along with the fact mikedee ended up leaving the compiz community resulting in cws being unmaintained. </p>

<p>I believe that was when I left the project alone for quite a while. </p>

<p>Until I found pyamf http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showpost.php?p=41801&amp;postcount=8 (this project wouldn&#39;t be alive if it weren&#39;t for pyamf) </p>

<p>It was then I decided to cleanup the code, which as you can see here http://flashbsm.googlecode.com/svn/branches/preCleanup/ was incredibly messy. Eventually I finished the cleanup (Jan 18 2008) http://flashbsm.googlecode.com/svn/branches/preAS3/.  </p>

<p>At this time however I came to the situation where the flashbsm required the classes that come with flash 8 to be able to compile (due to mx.remoting, which in turn was due to my need for pyamf). This meant that in order to compile the flashbsm you needed the flash 8 ide installed, which defeated the whole purpose of using pure actionscript in the first place. </p>

<p>After asking the people behind pyamf if there was an alternative to mx.remoting in as2, they told no, but if I went to AS3 then there would be alternatives. At first I was a bit reluctant to do so as I had a few other things I still wanted to reimplement in the cleanup. Those things only ended up actually taking about half an hour, so I moved to AS3  http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showpost.php?p=45802&amp;postcount=44 (about a 10 months after it was first suggested) </p>

<p>After yet another cleanup after I had a working version in AS3, I have now got to the point where every feature in the original mockup is now implemented in as3. It can also disable/enable plugins and displays every setting for every plugin. (however only boolean settings are configurable atm). </p>

<p>As it is, I currently don&#39;t have time to continue working on the flashbsm, but I do intend to finish it one day...... </p>

 summary : <p>Schizophrenia Ltd&#39;s Gtk Desktop System is a desktop environment based on GNOME with a few huge differences.</p>

<p>The Panel has no pull-up menus.  Instead, panel buttons pull up a frame in the center of the screen that is more user-friendly than the menu.  The taskbar is non-existent, replaced by a cooler &#39;iconified&#39; menu invoked by F10.</p>

<p>There is a customizable desktop switching animation, and the window placement sequence is comparable to Windows Vista (but much improved).</p>

<p>The 3D file manager is based on 3dfb, but with some changes (we&#39;re going to add previews to the file icons, and create 3d icons for the files without previews).</p>

<p>Desktop switching will be like SuSE&#39;s rotating cube, but customizable.  The Window Placement animation will be like what Microsoft Corporation is advertising for Windows Vista, except the windows will &#39;pop&#39; out of the icon that &#39;spawns&#39; it or whatever creates it with a cool effect.</p>

 title : The i-waiter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Using a pen and paper to take customer orders can be a real hassle , you misplace the paper, your pen doesn&#39;t write, you have to go to the kitchen to give the order , you don&#39;t know when is ready ... and so on. </p>

<p>Now you can use a small application to do much of the work for you. Waiters have PocketPCs on which they take orders and then they send them to the kitchen. From there when it is ready the waiter is automatically announced. </p>

<p>Plus you can build statistics based on tables that have the most customers, most requested foods and so on. </p>

<p>Enjoy. </p>

<p>Status Update - the project is on hold and no further development is intended at this point. The code can be used, but when time no longer was on my side - many shortcuts were taken.</p>

<p>1.0.4 Release2/1/08 </p>

<p>Changes </p>

<p>There was a bug where it didn&#39;t save preferences in 1.1.3.  This should be fixed now. Proper DNS resolution-- see http://dtztech.com/blog/?p=20 for more details. No longer uses http request, should be able to access servers like usenet-access.com and others Few memory leak fixes Very minor text changes </p>

<p>1.0.3 Release12/31/07 Changes: </p>

<p>&quot;Real Name&quot; option in preferences now in order to post with your name Dates are now visible in thread and group views Fixed numerous UI glitches Actually think that &#39;message from top&#39; bug is finally gone. Fixed potential cause of crash on initial install </p>

<p>NEWS12/18/07 </p>

<p>Just letting you know there is a lot of development being done on iNewsGroup, and I hope to make a big release in the near future. </p>

<p>Hang in there! :) </p>

<p>0.0.7 Release12/10/07 </p>

<p>Fixed &amp;nbsp;issue #21&amp;nbsp; Now click on &#39;arrow&#39; to read a group, removed annoying &#39;view&#39; button. Fixed some saving issues. Fixed connection logic issue. Cleaned up some of the code. Note: subscriptionview /can/ be a bit unwieldly for those large usenet servers... </p>

<p>echo &quot;group.i.want.to.subscribe.to:&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.newsrcFrom the command line will add it manually, if you find that easier. </p>

<p>0.0.6c Release12/10/07 Another quick fix for &amp;nbsp;issue #20&amp;nbsp;.  Thanks to Three60Guy for reporting it.  Also improved look of the subscription view, faster/smoother scrolling, and leaving subscription view and coming back again doesn&#39;t force a reload. </p>

<p>(BTW how did I ever get on this letter sub-numbering policy? sigh) </p>

<p>0.0.6b Release12/9/07 </p>

<p>Quick fix/update patching error in subscribe code that resulted in wrong groups being added/removed. </p>

<p>0.0.6 Release12/9/07 </p>

<p>Lots of fixes!! </p>

<p>Fixed &amp;nbsp;issue #3&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #4&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #5&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #9&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;issue #10&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #13&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #14&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #16&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;issue #18&amp;nbsp;. Alpha-sort the subscription view Added &quot;mark read&quot; option to mark an entire newsgroup read. Greatly improved the connection code, no longer crashes when connecting with bad auth info, and is smarter about handling errors. Reduced font size in a number of places to make room for more text. Numerous UI improvements. 11/28/07 </p>

<p>Currently busy with finals and whatnot, but should be making a big new release soon. :-) </p>

<p>0.0.5 Release11/13/07 </p>

<p>Fixed &amp;nbsp;issue #11&amp;nbsp;. /wow/ I wish I&#39;d caught that earlier.  For shame. Available in the usual places. </p>

<p>0.0.4 Release11/12/07 </p>

<p>Fixed DNS resolution issues.  It&#39;s a dirty hack, but does the job for now until core helps me figure out how to link libresolv.a into my application. Basically we just make an http request to the server-- basically we&#39;re programmatically doing the &#39;safari&#39; trick from before. </p>

<p>Hopefully this makes the app more usable. :) </p>

<p>0.0.3 Release11/5/07 </p>

<p>Newsgroup reader, Authentication support, manage subscriptions, read/unread status, threaded support, and a bunch of other things I forgot. </p>

<p>Note, due to lame iphone DNS issues, you either need to add your newsgroup server to your /etc/hosts, or visit it in safari first (and potentially every time) you use iNewsGroup. </p>

<p>The hacks the im applications use involve copying/modfying &#39;hosts&#39; and that&#39;s won&#39;t really work here since there&#39;s no way for me to ship a hosts file containing your server. :-/. </p>

<p>(Yes there were releases 0.0.2 and 0.0.1, but they were so beta that they weren&#39;t released publicly, and weren&#39;t worth writing up.)</p>
 title : The iphone-converter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Unit and Currency Converter for iPhone AboutI&#39;m coming from MS world, and actually my iPhone was the first Mac I ever touched. This toy was so cool that I just had to learn how to play with it. Zero Objective-C knowledge and lack of official SDK didn&#39;t stop me from trying, and after a few sleepless nights I&#39;ve created my first iPhone application (well, without counting HelloWorld). I hope you&#39;ll find it useful :) </p>

<p>UpdatesAppStore VersionAppStore version has finally launched: http://converter.vladimirkofman.com Please note, that there&#39;s no &quot;simple mode&quot; there, but I&#39;ll promise to add in the next update (in a week or so...). </p>

<p>25 March (0.22 release)1. New measurements: Acceleration, Angle, Prefixes, Luminance, Data Transfer, Force. </p>

<p>2. Measurements order is now editable: Just like units order in Advanced mode. </p>

<p>3. Ruler: Big thanks to Billy Chasen! </p>

<p>4. New currency rates provider: Data provided by http://www.iccfx.com. Huge thanks to Frederic! </p>

<p>5. Shake to refresh currency rates: No need to go to Settings screen, just shake your iPhone! </p>

<p>6. New languages </p>

<p>- Polish by Piotr Biegala and Tomasz Szeweluk </p>

<p>- Dutch by Herbert Kats </p>

<p>- Portuguese by Helvécio </p>

<p>- Traditional Chinese by Jerry </p>

<p>7. Scientific notation support: No more &quot;pound conversions Moved Accuracy slider under the actual numbers (I thought it is a better place...) Now when you change a measurement, the application will automatically bring you From and To screens (to save redundant clicks) Added a few units to existing measures, and two new measurements: Power and Torque  04 Jan: (0.13 release) Added support for accuracy (precision). Added additional measurement: &#39;Pressure&#39;. 03 Jan: (0.12 release) Added support for storing the last conversion: after application restart you&#39;d automatically get the latest conversion you have previously used. Currently the application remembers the latest Measurement and Units (should it also remember the actual conversion values? As for now it always starts from zero). 02 Jan: (0.11 release) Support for negative numbers input (like in temperature), support for epsilon values (the precision is still hardcoded...) 31 Dec: (0.10 release) Whew, I&#39;ve just released the first version of the Converter.</p>
 title : The iphone-insomnia Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Insomnia for iPhone </p>

<p>Insomnia is an iPhone native application that, when enabled, will prevent the iPhone from sleeping, thus overriding its default behaviour. This allows background applications to continue to run and WiFi to work long after the screen has been switched off. </p>

<p>(The iPhone&#39;s default behaviour is to sleep 30 seconds after the screen has gone off, when not docked and charging that is). </p>

<p>UsesInsomnia is useful if you are running a logging application that you would want to keep working while your phone is locked and the display is off. </p>

<p>If you are using an IM or IRC client that you wish to stay connected to receive messages while the screen is off. </p>

<p>If you are the creator of a logging or IM application hopefully you can use the Insomnia source to build the ability to stay on into your application, without harmfully deleting power config files. e.g. ApolloIM and MobileChat. However if you would like your application to do something periodically a much better approach would be to schedule a wake up, and allow it to sleep in between times, to conserve battery power like so: </p>

<p>NSCalendarDate *nextWake = [[NSCalendarDate calendarDate] dateByAddingYears:0 months:0 days:0 hours:0 minutes:15 seconds:0];
<br/>CPSchedulePowerUpAtDate((CFDateRef)nextWake); // From AppSupport frameworkThe problem with this technique is that it also turns on the phone if it is powered off. Also WiFi doesn&#39;t appear to connect (associate) along with the device. </p>

<p>This new technique I have discovered will wake the device but not turn it on if it is off. WiFi doesn&#39;t connect though. </p>

<p>NSDate* nextWake = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:15*60]; //secs
<br/>//cancel any old wakes
<br/>	NSData* data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile: @&quot;/private/var/preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist&quot;];
<br/>	NSString* errorString = nil;
<br/>	NSDictionary* dict = [NSPropertyListSerialization propertyListFromData:data mutabilityOption:kCFPropertyListImmutable format:NULL errorDescription:&amp;errorString];
<br/>	
<br/>	if(errorString){
<br/>		NSLog(@&quot;Failed to read dict %@&quot;,errorString);
<br/>	}
<br/>	NSArray* wake = [dict objectForKey:@&quot;wake&quot;];
<br/>	for(NSDictionary* item in wake){
<br/>		if([[item objectForKey:@&quot;scheduledby&quot;] isEqualToString:@&quot;com.imalc.insomnia&quot;]){
<br/>			NSDate* d = [item objectForKey:@&quot;time&quot;];
<br/>			NSLog(@&quot;Cancelling previous wake at %@&quot;,d);
<br/>			CPCancelWakeAtDateWithIdentifier(d,@&quot;com.imalc.insomnia&quot;);
<br/>		}
<br/>	}
<br/>	//schedule new wake
<br/>	CPScheduleWakeAtDateWithIdentifier((CFDateRef)nextWake,@&quot;com.imalc.insomnia&quot;);Then you need to cancel the suspend power notifications while you are doing your work, so the phone stays on while it is working. If you don&#39;t do this then it turns off again 15 seconds later interfering with what you need done. This last part is in the Insomnia source code on this site. </p>

<p>InstallationYou can find it in Cydia. Insomnia is developed using an iPhone on 3.1.2 so there may be problems on earlier versions of the OS but it should work on 2.0 and later. </p>

<p>UsageRun Insomnia and switch it on. You will see an icon in the status bar when it is active. If you are installing for the first time you may need to reboot your iPhone for the icon to appear because the Springboard only reads the icons at boot. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>How does it work?It does 3 things: </p>

<p>It runs a daemon that uses IORegisterForSystemPower and listens to the kIOMessageCanSystemSleep message which is sent every minute when the phone&#39;s screen is off. When it intercepts this message it uses IOCancelPowerChange to prevent it going to sleep. </p>

 title : The mobilestack Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Stack v2.1 has been pushed to the packager (STE) for release very soon!  </p>

<p>New features include: </p>

<p>Adjustable Stack Position (bottom right / center are currently the only options) Uninstalled apps are now handled properly (no white icons left in the Stack) Smoother Animation Aliased (jagged) edges now smooth Calendar icon now displays properly, and updates in line with the current date Settings in Settings.app Icon hit-rects have been improved, meaning it&#39;s a lot easier to tap items at the top of the Stack I hope you like it, and I have another update coming soon to bring you a couple more features I developed for v2.1 but removed at the last minute. </p>

<p>Stack 2.0 is released! Download from Cydia from STE Packaging. It incorporates dragging icons directly from SpringBoard to Stack, and also supports Winterboard themes. You can also drag an item out of the Stack to remove it.  The first version of Stack does not run on iPhone OS 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and is now deprecated and should not be installed.  </p>

<p>Stack 2.0 is closed-source. Only Stack 1.0 is provided as source in the subversion repository, but is deprecated and very rough. Contact me if you have questions about how 2.0 works, I&#39;m always happy to help.</p>
 title : The mysecs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is mySecs?Set of applications (windows client, web) to measure/analyze time spent in a day. Currently only Windows Client is ready. </p>

<p>Why did I create mySecs?There are couple of reasons.  </p>

<p>To start with, I wanted to learn IronPython, Python implementation for Windows .NET framework. I&#39;m keen on improving productivity. Having these two in mind, I developed mySecs. </p>

<p>How to get started?Download the latest Windows Client Tool. Unzip into a directory (do not open the zip file) From the unzipped directory, execute mysecs.exe What about configuration?There are three types of configuration in the config.xml file. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t Track : List the applications that you don&#39;t want to track. It could include any games or music play or other non-productive applications. It depends on personal preference. Application Mapping : mySecs comes with few categorization. However it is not comprehensive. Feel free to modify and/or add to this mapping. This is of type, iexplore 
<br/>Application name is as it appears in the Task Manager. It is neither the executable name nor Application Title. I know it is difficult, however as of now, I don&#39;t know of a better way. If you&#39;ve any suggestions, feel free to contact me. 
<br/>Google AppEngine : I&#39;ve a plan to integrate with a web application hosted in Google AppEngine. This is not fully implemented and hence can be ignored. </p>

<p>Is my data safe?Currently there is only a Windows Client Tool and no integration with any other web servers. Hence the data lies within the machine that you install. </p>

<p>Are there any screen shots?As soon as you open the tool, it will display a blank dashboard. As the tool gathers data the dashboard will be displayed properly. Dashboards contains two pie-charts. One is about top 5 applications and another is top 5 categories. Time is mentioned in minutes. </p>

 title : The simple-semantic-desktop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Simple Semantic Desktop is currently a work in its infancy at Oberlin College, Ohio. The Simple Semantic Desktop aims at making a Semantic Desktop product that can be easily understood and used by the average PC user, using a simpler and less overwhelming interface than the other offerings available. This is not to say that the technologies underlying the SSD are in any way simple. The SSD will use state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Ontological techniques, perhaps even improvements over what exists. The SSD is also subtly different in the sense that it aims to be a semantics based interface to all files on a computer including program and OS files. </p>

<p>Following along the footsteps of the sensational Semantic Web is the idea of a Semantic Desktop (see http://www.semanticdesktop.org/) . The original Semantic Desktop is imagined to be a universal interface to all information on a desktop that utilizes Ontologies (sets of concepts and their relationships to each other) described like they are on the Semantic Web. One can imagine such a well-informed (well-informed about information on your computer, that is) to provide some very interesting and &quot;cool&quot; interfaces . The possibilities are endless, and that&#39;s where the problems begin. Most Semantic Desktop software today is too complex and non-intuitive for the average user, and the Simple Semantic Desktop tries to fill that gap. </p>

<p>Can we display the complex relationships of a Machine Learning-based Semantic Desktop with the simplicity of a Vending Machine? I&#39;ll build the Simple Semantic Desktop as my senior Computer Science honors project, and two extra words on a sheet of cellulose will be our answer.</p>

 title : The textcommerce Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introduction Hi everyone. My name’s Levi. I’m a freelance web developer . I started using TextPattern for my sites about six months ago and I’m hooked. I get regular requests to build online stores and, for lack of a better option, I’ve been using DigiShop for all my clients. I found myself wishing that there was a solution that managed stores as well as Textpattern manages sites. Then it hit me: why can’t TXP manage stores? Why not another solution? </p>

<p>The only two open-source solutions on the market are osCommerce and Zen Cart and they share the same code base. Both are over-blown and archaic, completely lacking in elegance. Speaking from experience, customizing one of these solutions is a nightmare of digging through miles of code circa 1999. Most people go with basic variations of the default install. </p>

<p>So why Textpattern? I doubt that I need to reiterate the benefits of using Textpattern to build a website. It just makes it easier. I believe that with a few plugins the same benefits could be applied to building an online store. The store plugin would focus specifically on taking advantage of the following features: </p>

<p>Custom Admin Interface Because Textpattern allows users to write admin plugins the store would have its own management section separate from the rest of the TextPattern functionality. I’m thinking it would be a peer tab to ‘content’ and ‘presentation’. This would give developers the ability to let store content managers to administer their store. This admin section would handle the following items: </p>

<p> Product categories 2. Product management (standard CRUD functions) 
<br/>3. Customer management 
<br/>4. Order management 
<br/>5. Store settings 
<br/>The Plugin API Standard E-Commerce components would be built as individual plugins that don’t depend on each other. So if you wanted to have a custom payment/checkout process but also wanted use other existing plugins you could just write a new plugin and replace the tag without breaking any of the store’s other functionality. Products would be Articles </p>

<p>Normal product attributes such as weight and price would be custom fields. This way store developers can take advantages of the wealth of tags and functionality available to articles.</p>

 summary : <p>YouNote Desktop is a desktop application for Mac OS X or Windows users that allows to backup and restore the notes created with YouNote on iPhone (YouNote on the App Store) wirelessly.  The same tool is used if you want to transfer your notes from YouNote Lite to YouNote. </p>

<p>How it works in brief? </p>

<p>When you want to backup, YouNote establishes a connection with YouNote Desktop then send the notes. The notes are stored on your desktop in your local backup folder. </p>

<p>And when you want to restore, same process: YouNote downloads the notes stored in the chosen archive then recreates your notes on your iPhone. </p>

<p>Please follow the instructions user first and take a look on our  known issues page. A french version is also available. </p>

<p>To download, click here. </p>

<p>The minimal release requirement on you iPhone/iPod Touch is YouNote 1.3. </p>

<p>YouNote Desktop runs on Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 on Intel and PowerPC and on Windows XP/Vista. </p>

<p>And one more thing: YouNote Desktop is in open source so other developers can contribute to enhance this application. If you would like to contribute to YouNote Desktop, drop us an email. </p>

 title : The ai4firewall Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Atualmente, a gerência da segurança das informações que são geradas dentro das corporações demandam grande esforço humano e material além de garantias de continuidade de serviços e produtos selecionados para prover a segurança dos dados. </p>

<p>Firewalls são ferramentas de software que aplicam regras definidas em sua configuração para tratar os dados que entram e saem de uma rede. Essas regras provêem à ferramenta a capacidade de classificar os fragmentos de informação que recebe de acordo com seu grau de nocividade à integridade do sistema. </p>

<p>O trabalho apresenta um estudo de aplicação de metodologias de inteligência artificial, mais especificamente ligadas às redes neurais artificiais, na definição das regras que governam uma ferramenta de firewall. </p>

<p>O projeto é implementado em linguagem Java e utiliza uma base de conhecimento desenvolvida em PostgreSQL. A API Drools, fornece os recursos necessários para aplicação de técnicas de redes neurais artificiais e possibilitam o armazenamento de regras e tomadas de decisão baseadas em fatos. A utilização do programa PersonalBrain auxiliou no desenvolvimento e mapeamento dos nodos (neurônios) dentro da aplicação. Utilizamos ainda como sistema operacional para testes e validação o OpenSolaris, por possuir ferramentas de desenvolvimento que facilitaram na implementação. </p>

<p>A modelagem e documentação do software foram desenvolvidas com a utilização de diagramas UML e estabelecem uma base para a continuidade do estudo e novas implementações.</p>

 title : The dieu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>About Dieudieu is a social bookmarking tool for the GNOME desktop, inspired by the OS X tools Pukka and delibar. dieu tries to be fast and stay out of your way, while allowing you to quickly and easily bookmark the sites you want. </p>

<p>Have you ever gone on vacation and tried to do something from a public terminal, only to realise that you can&#39;t remember the website you wanted? Have you ever read an interesting article and forgotten where you found it when you want it? Have you ever wanted to share a list of interesting links with your friends and family? </p>

<p>Social bookmarking websites solve this. By allowing you post your bookmarks to the web instead of to your own walled garden, you can find them at any time and use them just as easily. But their interfaces are often clunky and slow, built around AJAX and other flashy web technologies that end up with you wasting time loading and rendering. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where dieu comes in. With dieu, bookmarking and posting your favorite websites is as simple as &#39;click - tag - go.&#39; You&#39;d be amazed how much faster things are. </p>

<p>Download </p>

<p>Features- Quick and low on resources 
<br/>- Handles multiple accounts from any of several social bookmarking services 
<br/>- Bookmarks available from tray icon 
<br/>- Can install bookmarklet for fast posting from a web browser 
<br/>- Libnotify integration

<p>3)The xml information from the server will contain file and folder names and their associated attributes in XML format . The builtin xml parser constructs an element tree and this is used for displaying the file attributes(properties). </p>

<p>4)Writing to a remote file: Using XMLRPC(apache java libs) and write concurrency issues </p>

<p>5)contents of a folder on another node is obtained by the local server only when the gui requests it. Now these contents , which are already in the servers memory can remain there. When the GUI once again requests the same nodes contents , it can be given back easily. A cache mechanism to save a folders contents(list of files and folders)</p>

 title : The ultimate-theme-manager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ultimate Theme ManagerAbandonedI haven&#39;t done anything on this project for a long time. If you want to take over the project or do anything of that sort, email me at sharkbaitbobby+utm@gmail.com. </p>

<p>PurposeImagine you want your entire Linux desktop to be a certain color, such as blue. Normally, you would have to change your settings for Firefox, then Blender, then Avant Window Navigator, then GTK, and maybe even Emerald, all in separate applications. But Ultimate Theme Manager has the capability to do all of that in one application. 
<br/>Screenshot </p>

<p>InstallationUltimate Theme Manager can be installed in only a few commands. 
<br/>mkdir ultimate-theme-manager &amp;&amp; cd ultimate-theme-manager &amp;&amp; wget http://ultimate-theme-manager.googlecode.com/files/ultimate-theme-manager.tgz &amp;&amp; tar -xvvzf ultimate-theme-manager.tgz &amp;&amp; sudo python install.py </p>

<p>Or, if you prefer to download via subversion for any reason, use this command: 
<br/>svn checkout http://ultimate-theme-manager.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ultimate-theme-manager &amp;&amp; cd ultimate-theme-manager &amp;&amp; sudo python install.py (To run these commands, highlight and right click the text, and click Copy. Then go to the Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal menu. Right click in the window, and click Paste. Then hit enter. You will then see a &quot;Password: &quot; prompt. Enter your password and hit enter.) </p>

<p>After installation, Ultimate Theme Manager should be accessible from the Applications-&gt;Accessories menu. If you installed just for yourself (read the README), it  should be on your desktop. 
<br/>DependenciesI don&#39;t know the exact dependencies, but I know python and gtk 2.0 are required. See Dependencies for more information 
<br/>Coming Soon New Features (!)Very soon you will be able to Now you can filter your themes and theme types by name and description. Just type the text into the entry widget at the top, and only themes and theme types that have that text in their name or description will be shown. 
<br/>Also, you will have can have repositories for themes and theme types. Click &quot;Get Types&quot; to download and install the theme type so the look of the application referred to by the theme type can be configured and managed by Ultimate Theme Manager. Click &quot;Get Themes&quot; to download and import themes for the applications you have. The repositories will also have the ability to provide upgrades to the themes and types. 
<br/>Theme TypesTheme types allow Ultimate Theme Manager to configure the applications you have installed. As of writing this, there is only one fully working theme type for UTM. It can be downloaded from here. Open UTM and select the file you downloaded. When the prompt shows, click &quot;New Theme Type.&quot; You can then export your themes, add new ones to the list, and change which theme you will use.

<br/>DevelopersIf you want Ultimate Theme Manager to be able to manage your application&#39;s look and themes, a theme type must be made. Check the README-dev file. I have written a theme type for Affinity, which can be an example if you are trying to create a theme type and README-dev is not enough (download here). I will probably be able to finish one for Avant Window Navigator soon, however if you want to please feel free to do so. If you want to help with UTM in any way, please do. Email me at sharkbaitbobby+utm@gmail.com. 
<br/>To doI have a lot planned for UTM. In the list is: 
<br/>Do updates/upgrades. Improve the README and README-dev. Make a Debian/APT repository. Clean up the code some more. If development&#39;s slowI have never used subversion before, so I really have (almost) no idea what I&#39;m doing. So I apoligize if things are a little slow because I can&#39;t figure out something. This is also my first real program written in Python and the first graphical application (gtk, qt, etc.), and I don&#39;t have a a lot of time to work on UTM most of the time.

 summary : <p>IntroductionThe Big Brother IRC Bot is a modular, Java based IRC Bot and IRC Bot framework.   </p>

<p>Some of the planned modules are: </p>

<p>A logging module to log the conversations in IRC channels to the website.  Will also contain a way to bookmark conversations to make them easier to find and link to. A RSS module, that can follow RSS feeds, and notify the IRC channel when there is a new RSS item. Reading the latest changes from a mediawiki wiki, and presenting them with links to the changed pages and edit comments. Messages between users. Last seen info for users, and statistic when users are online. It is easy to add new modules.  A module can provide commands that are available to the users in the irc channel, and modules can also provide webpages that are assembled into a website for the IRC bot. </p>

<p>StatusWork is ongoing, first release should be soon. </p>

<p>CompilingThis project uses maven for compilation.  You need Maven 2 and Java 1.5 installed and configured to compile it. </p>

<p>Use mvn clean install to do a compile.  Maven will download required libraries automatically. </p>

<p>You can also use  mvn idea:idea  or  mvn eclipse:eclipse  to create an IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse project.  This will also configure the IDE to use the libraries downloaded by maven, so you don&#39;t need to download them separately (tested with idea, not yet with eclipse).   </p>

<p>You can use mvn idea:idea -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true to force maven to download and set up sources and javadocs for your idea project, so that javadoc lookups and library source navigation works.  Similar parameters might work for eclipse.</p>

 title : The decap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Decap is an advanced irc client based on ii. Decap uses Qt 4.3 to create a graphical wrapper around ii&#39;s output. This allows you to inherit irc sessions from multiple clients at the same time, for example on a work computer, a home computer and a school computer. </p>

<p>This represents a radical departure from current software implementations, as decap can utilize the same advanced irc features as a normal graphical irc client, but the persistent &quot;decapitated&quot; nature of the backend allows the frontend to roam with the user, or be completely shutdown without losing track of conversations or channel logs. </p>

<p>Decap also hooks nicely into BitlBee, allowing full participation on any supported IM protocol. Decap lets you view buddy pictures inline, transfer files via drag-and-drop, and many other advanced features unavailable on command-line irc clients.</p>

 title : The hephaestus-irc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hephaestus IRC will be an Internet Relay Chat client for programmers. This means, at least for the initial releases, it will be integrated with a pastebin. Hephaestus IRC will be written in Python using pyGTK.</p>
 summary : <p>This is a python weechat plugin that I&#39;m writing to meet an irc need of mine.   </p>

<p>I prefer weechat as an irc client, but have noticed all too often that I&#39;ll leave my weechat session for an hour, a day, or a weekend, and I will come back and have had multiple nickname highlights where other irc denizens have addressed me, yet it&#39;s difficult (and time consuming) to search each backlog looking for them - nevermind the fact that there may be multiple nick highlights in the same buffer. </p>

<p>So the idea here is to aggregate all lines that trigger a nick highlight that occur in a channel, store them internally, and print them out by simply typing a command. </p>

<p>Usage: </p>

<p>Download highlights.py and place it in your ~/.weechat/python/autoload directory and restart weechat -or- place it somewhere in  ~/.weechat and manually type /python load highlights.py .   </p>

<p>Once the plugin has been loaded, type /help hls to see its usage. 
<br/>The script can be unloaded by typing /python unload highlights 
<br/>Downloading: </p>

<p>Please download the latest trunk version: http://highlightaggregator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/highlights.py 
<br/>   Requirements: I built this with weechat 0.2.6 and python 2.5.  I can only verify that it works with these two versions of weechat and python. </p>

<p>Happy irc&#39;ing! </p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE INFORMATIONWill commit REV2 (really REV1 but ...meh) in a few days that&#39;ll be the first public release. Support available at irc.devnode.org #mcgw :) </p>

<p>Techie is an EXTREMELY modular IRC bot. In fact, the main goal, is that you can unload all the modules, and just have a bot that sits in channels and does nothing (but who would want that).. The bot will (probably some day) have a database similar to ArchLinux&#39;s AUR in which users can write modules, and you can even add them in IRC. I imagine the syntax would be something like !modules add -u   (of course Techie would need write permissions in ./modules). </p>

<p>But yeah this bot is going to be extremely modular. And yes, it stores its data with a constant connection to MySQL, but hey its worth it.. Really... This bot is the best bot I have written (and .. StarNIX really wasn&#39;t that bad...This is 490x better =P (random number ftw)  ) </p>

 title : The chmtopdf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>chmtopdfCon este simple programa se pueden convertir nuestros archivos que se encuentran en formato .chm a .pdf, pasando por LaTeX primeramente. Esto nos permite tener un documento, libro o reporte con todo lo que brinda LaTeX. </p>

<p>chmtopdf está desarrollado en Python utilizando el módulo BeautifulSoup para generar el archivo .tex de LaTeX. Luego se utilizar el compilador de LaTeX para generar el archivo .pdf </p>

<p>Para la inserción de imágenes en el archivo .pdf es necesario un programa extra, sam2p, que convierte las imágenes de cualquier formato (gif, png, jpg, etc) a .eps (Encapsule PostScript) que son las soportadas por LaTeX. </p>

<p>Para realizar la conversión, necesitamos tener bastante información del archivo .chm, o mejor dicho, del .html que obtenemos luego de descomprimir este. Por el momento la búsqueda y selección de configuraciones no está automatizada y es bastante complicado de llevar a cabo. </p>

<p>screenshots</p>

<p>kchmtopdf  gchmtopdf       </p>

<p>ejemploEl programa funciona convirtiendo las etiquetas HTML en código LaTeX de acuerdo a cómo se indique. Así mismo las páginas HTML pueden contener, en una misma etiqueta una hojas de estilo diferente, por lo que en el texto resultante se verá distinto. Esto también se le puede indicar al programa para que lo trabaje de la forma adecuada. </p>

<p>Si tenemos el siguiente texto por ejemplo, y le aplicáramos el programa chmtopdf: </p>

<p>Latex</p>

<p>El LaTeX es un procesador de textos que está formado 
<br/>mayoritariamente por órdenes (macros) construidas a partir de comandos de TeX 
<br/>—un lenguaje «de bajo nivel», en el sentido de que sus acciones últimas son muy 
<br/>elementales— pero con la ventaja añadida, en palabras de Lamport[3] , de «poder aumentar las 
<br/>capacidades de LaTeX utilizando comandos propios del TeX descritos en  The 
<br/>TeXbook»[4]</p>

<p>Esto es lo que convierte a LaTeX en una herramienta práctica 
<br/>y útil pues, a su facilidad de uso, se une toda la potencia de TeX. Estas características 
<br/>hicieron que LaTeX se extendiese rápidamente entre un amplio sector científico y  
<br/>técnico, hasta el punto de convertirse en uso obligado en comunicaciones y congresos, y 
<br/>requerido por determinadas revistas a la hora de entregar artículos académicos.</p>

<p>Un fragmento del archivo .tex será algo muy similar a esto: </p>

<p>\chapter{Latex}
<br/>El \textit{LaTeX} es un procesador de textos que est&#39;a formado mayoritariamente por

<br/>a~nadida, en palabras de Lamport $^{[3]}$, de poder aumentar las capacidades de LaTeX
<br/>utilizando comandos propios del TeX descritos en  \textit{The TeXbook} $^{[4]}$.</p>

<p>Esto es lo que convierte a \textbf{LaTeX} en una herramienta pr&#39;actica y &#39;util pues,

<br/>acad&#39;emicos.

<p> </p>

<p>Nota: el texto fue extraído de Wikipedia, presisamente de aquí. </p>

<p>estadoActualmente el programa está en desarrollo, aunque este se puede utilizar libremente para la conversión de archivos, no es tan sencillo de configurar. Los resultados de la conversión de los archivos en la mayoría de los casos es el esperado por el usuario, si este fué bien configurado y el archivo chm no está dañado. </p>

<p>En algunos casos se necesita corregir el archivo .tex para personalizarlo en cuanto a márgenes, quitar algún texto irrelevante, etc. Esto igualmente es en la minoría de los casos. </p>

<p>feedbackSe agradecería que todos los usuarios que utilicen el programa, dejen comentarios por cualquier fallo o incluso conversión exitosa para poder ir corrigiendo posibles bugs en el motor del programa y tener conocimientos sobre qué circunstancias funcionó correctamente.</p>

 summary : <p>Hakix is a simple GUI installer program for Debian Etch 4.0. It provides an easy ‘one-click’ installation of various popular applications, as well as other popular features (and notoriously troublesome-to-install/configure) packages such as Beryl/AIGLX 3D Desktop software, nVidia drivers, and other tools (some that I simply found useful to have ready to install in one place! </p>

<p>Warning: Hakix is extremely out of date and not actively maintained. The author accepts no responsibility for use of this software or what it might do to your Debian installation. I advise you to either investigate Automatix for Debian Etch, send me abuse to try and make me update it, or to stop being lazy and fire up a command line :) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Version 0.5 and prior are based on DCConfig which is in turn based on the original &#39;1.0&#39; Automatix for Ubuntu (see screenshot below) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The deprecated version 0.3.5 is written in Python using PyGTK and was written from scratch, not based on DCConfig (see screenshot below) </p>

 title : The karambino Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Karambino Installer utilizes SuperKaramba&#39;s ability to &#39;run&#39; *.skz files, which are just zip archives with skz extension. This allows small software and content creators to package their content into a self-containted, &#39;executable&#39; file. All the user has to do to install the content - double-click the downloaded file.</p>

<p>The behavior we are trying to achieve is similar to that MS Windows users have with *.MSI files, where, assuming the framework for &#39;running&#39; .msi files is present, installation becomes: download (1 file), double-click, follow the prompts.</p>

<p>The installation steps are listed in an INI-type file, where each section is one &quot;task&quot; and contains reference to next &quot;task&quot; The goal of Karambino in that regard is to make creation of installabe packages almost as easy as writing cooking directions. Example:</p>

<p>=============================
<br/>[welcome]
<br/>actiontype = message
<br/>text = This procedure will install AbraKadabra.
<br/>title = %caption%
<br/>nextaction = chooseskin
<br/>[chooseskin]
<br/>actiontype = choice
<br/>text = Please, choose the skin variety.
<br/>title = %caption%
<br/>value = &#39;dark&#39;,&#39;Dark transparent background&#39;,&#39;light&#39;,&#39;Light transparent background&#39;
<br/>nextaction = %output%
<br/>[dark]
<br/>actiontype = extract
<br/>value = &#39;product/dark/*&#39;
<br/>target = &#39;%skinpath%tabs/&#39;
<br/>nextaction = common1
<br/>...
<br/>=======================================</p>

<p>Karambino Installer carries all &#39;instalation tasks&#39; libraries (python scripts) together with the installable content in the skz (zip) file. At present Kdialog facility of KDE is used for prompts and questions.</p>

<p>The following functions are supported with commit # 1:
<br/>- Showing informational message (kdialog popup)
<br/>- Showing &quot;Choose one of these options&quot; dialog. (kdialog popup)
<br/>- Unpack (unzip) selective contents of the package.
<br/>- Manipulate INI-type configuration files. (load, save, get, set value)</p>

<p>一个网络化的辞典软件，希望国人都学好英语，为祖国作出更多的贡献。他通过网络实现查英语单词的解释，查汉子的解释，同时支持在线生词本和屏幕取词功能。如果你想运行他请安装好相关的kde环境，其实只要你的机器现在可以运行evaqq那么运行这个软件也是没有问题的，他们都是kde环境下开发的。需要大家注意的是如果你想使用软件的生词本功能那么你要到bbs.dict.cn注册一个帐号然后在软件的设置界面里输入你的帐号，那么软件的生词本就同网站同步了。你也可以在设置选项里选择你使用的是网通还是电信线路，这可能对查词速度有一定的影响。需要大家注意的是这个软件调用了konqueror，确切的说是调用了 KHTMLPart，因为返回界面中要用到flash（就是那个读音按钮）。因此需要konqueror支持flash播放。至于怎么设置 konqueror其实只要在它的插件配置窗口设置一下就可以了。在此也感谢eva的作者云帆在开发过程中给予的帮助。就像大家所看到的这个软件的版本还很底，因此错误和bug在所难免，如果你遇到什么问题或者有什么好的建议情发邮件或者到我的blog说明，我将非常愿意听取。另外大家可能看到了 kdict的图标是不太好看的（至少我这样认为），所以如果你有一个16*16的适合这个软件的图标请提供给我，一旦被采用你的名字将出现在贡献者列表中。 </p>

<p>o KFL esta sendo criado por Artur P. Seixas o KFL é muito intereçante, pois você tem uma interface gráfica, com varios comandos, tem até um gerenciador de arquivos, e editores de texto em apenas um dsiquetesinho! </p>

<p>como isso funciona </p>

<p>o KFL é báseado no busybox como a maioria das distros em disquete, o q faz com que ele aramzene varios comandos em um minimo dsiquete,a diferença do KFL é que ele vem com um gerenciador de interfaces como dialog, e isso que faz ele ter uma interface gráfica e ser diferente dos linux em shell, num eh o q digamos de um gnome ou KDE mais dah pro gasto, eh melhor do que ficar digitando comandos </p>

<p>ah, flanu em KDE, esse projeto não tem nada a ver com o KDE interface gráfica, é outra coisa, de outro desenvolvedor, não tem nada a ver! </p>

 title : The notefinder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NoteFinder is an extensible PIM implemented in Python.</p>

<p>It was firstly developed as a simple command-line interface note-taking application that used a filesystem as database and featured tagging and search.</p>

<p>Now it has been rewritten to be as extensible and modular as possible.</p>

<p>Thanks to modular architecture it became possible to turn it into a full featured PIM able to store not only notes, but contacts, tasks, spreadsheets, bookmarks, web pages and any files too.</p>

<p>Unlike in most commonly used PIMs like MS Outlook, Kontact, Evolution, Mozilla Sunbird those provide different non-integrated interfaces to access different data, everything is tightly integrated and stored in a single database so you can use common interface to search for records, list, view and edit them.</p>

They also have more options when run alone than when fired by smxi, so check them out to see if there&#39;s something in them that might be of use to you. </p>

<p>sgfxi now has its own svn because it needs to become more of a standalone project, like the new inxi irc/system information script </p>

 summary : <p>La aplicación Click To Talk para PYMEs es una aplicación distribuida orientada a demostrar el uso de APIs de Telefónica por parte de terceras empresas para acceder a servicios de comunicación. El objetivo principal de la aplicación (desde el punto de vista del usuario) es permitir la realización de llamadas de voz entre terminales IMS invocando la llamada desde una página web (en lugar de iniciarla desde el terminal directamente). </p>

<p>El caso de uso típico para esta aplicación sería el siguiente: un usuario navega por el portal web corporativo de una empresa (PYME), donde encuentra la información de contacto de la empresa. Esta información de contacto incluye un número de teléfono que aparece como un hiperenlace. Al hacer click en el número de teléfono se abre una nueva ventana (aplicación Click2Talk) que le permite establecer una comunicación entre su teléfono y el teléfono de contacto de la PYME. Tras introducir los datos requeridos se inicia una llamada de voz hacia su teléfono y hacia el teléfono de la empresa. Una vez que ambos extremos responden a la llamada se ponen en comunicación directa, con lo que el usuario tiene la sensación de haber llamado directamente a la empresa. </p>

<p>Adicionalmente, la aplicación presenta diversas opciones como la identificación del llamante, información sobre el estado de la línea de la empresa (libre u ocupada) o la posibilidad de programar la hora a la que se realizará la llamada.</p>

 title : The s3backer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>s3backer is a filesystem that contains a single file backed by the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).  As a filesystem, it is very simple: it provides a single normal file having a fixed size.  Underneath, the file is divided up into blocks, and the content of each block is stored in a unique Amazon S3 object.  In other words, what s3backer provides is really more like an S3-backed virtual hard disk device, rather than a filesystem. </p>

<p>In typical usage, a normal filesystem is mounted on top of the file exported by the s3backer filesystem using a loopback mount (or disk image mount on Mac OS X). </p>

<p>This arrangement has several benefits compared to more complete S3 filesystem implementations: </p>

<p>By not attempting to implement a complete filesystem, which is a complex undertaking and difficult to get right, s3backer can stay very lightweight and simple. Only three HTTP operations are used: GET, PUT, and DELETE.  All of the experience and knowledge about how to properly implement filesystems that already exists can be reused. By utilizing existing filesystems, you get full UNIX filesystem semantics.  Subtle bugs or missing functionality relating to hard links, extended attributes, POSIX locking, etc. are avoided. The gap between normal filesystem semantics and Amazon S3 ``eventual consistency&#39;&#39; is more easily and simply solved when one can interpret S3 objects as simple device blocks rather than filesystem objects (see below). When storing your data on Amazon S3 servers, which are not under your control, the ability to encrypt data becomes a critical issue. s3backer supports secure encryption and authentication. Alternately, the encryption capability built into the Linux loopback device can be used. Since S3 data is accessed over the network, local caching is also very important for performance reasons.  Since s3backer presents the equivalent of a virtual hard disk to the kernel, most of the filesystem caching can be done where it should be: in the kernel, via the kernel&#39;s page cache.  However s3backer also includes its own internal block cache for increased performance, using asynchronous worker threads to take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the network. Consistency GuaranteesAmazon S3 makes relatively weak guarantees relating to the timing and consistency of reads vs. writes (collectively known as &quot;eventual consistency&quot;).  s3backer includes logic and configuration parameters to work around these limitations, allowing the user to guarantee consistency to whatever level desired, up to and including 100% detection and avoidance of incorrect data. These are: </p>

<p>s3backer enforces a minimum delay between consecutive PUT or DELETE operations on the same block.  This ensures that Amazon S3 doesn&#39;t receive these operations out of order. s3backer maintains an internal block MD5 checksum cache, which enables automatic detection and rejection of `stale&#39; blocks returned by GET operations. This logic is configured by the following command line options: --md5CacheSize, --md5CacheTime, and --minWriteDelay. </p>

<p>Zeroed Block OptimizationAs a simple optimization, s3backer does not store blocks containing all zeroes; instead, they are simply deleted.  Conversely, reads of non-existent blocks will contain all zeroes.  In other words, the backed file is always maximally sparse. </p>

<p>As a result, blocks do not need to be created before being used and no special initialization is necessary when creating a new filesystem. </p>

<p>When the --listBlocks flag is given, s3backer will list all existing blocks at startup so it knows ahead of time exactly which blocks are empty. </p>

<p>File and Block Size Auto-DetectionAs a convenience, whenever the first block of the backed file is written, s3backer includes as meta-data (in the x-amz-meta-s3backer-filesize header) the total size of the file.  Along with the size of the block itself, this value can be checked and/or auto-detected later when the filesystem is remounted, eliminating the need for the --blockSize or --size flags to be explicitly provided and avoiding accidental mis-interpretation of an existing filesystem. </p>

<p>Block Caches3backer includes support for an internal block cache to increase performance.  The block cache cache is completely separate from the MD5 cache which only stores MD5 checksums transiently and whose sole purpose is to mitigate ``eventual consistency&#39;&#39;.  The block cache is a traditional cache containing cached data blocks.  When full, clean blocks are evicted as necessary in LRU order. </p>

<p>Reads of cached blocks will return immediately with no network traffic. Writes to the cache also return immediately and trigger an asynchronous write operation to the network via a separate worker thread.  Because the kernel typically writes blocks through FUSE filesystems one at a time, performing writes asynchronously allows s3backer to take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the network, vastly improving write performance. </p>

<p>The block cache can be configured to store the cached data in a local file instead of in memory.  This permits larger cache sizes and allows s3backer to reload cached data after a restart.  Reloaded data is verified via MD5 checksum with Amazon S3 before reuse. </p>

<p>The block cache is configured by the following command line options: --blockCacheFile, --blockCacheNoVerify, --blockCacheSize, --blockCacheThreads and --blockCacheWriteDelay. </p>

<p>Read Aheads3backer implements a simple read-ahead algorithm in the block cache.  When a configurable number of blocks are read in order, block cache worker threads are awoken to begin reading subsequent blocks into the block cache. Read ahead continues as long as the kernel continues reading blocks sequentially. The kernel typically requests blocks one at a time, so having multiple worker threads already reading the next few blocks improves read performance by taking advantage of the parallelism inherent in the network. </p>

<p>Note that the kernel implements a read ahead algorithm as well; its behavior should be taken into consideration.  By default, s3backer passes the -o max_readahead=0 option to FUSE. </p>

<p>Read ahead is configured by the --readAhead and --readAheadTrigger command line options. </p>

<p>Encryption and Authentications3backer supports encryption via the --encrypt, --password, and --passwordFile flags.  When encryption is enabled, SHA1 HMAC authentication is also automatically enabled, and s3backer rejects any blocks that are not properly encrypted and signed. </p>

<p>Encrypting at the s3backer layer is preferable to encrypting at an upper layer (e.g., at the loopback device layer), because if the data s3backer sees is already encrypted it can&#39;t optimize away zeroed blocks or do meaningful compression. </p>

<p>Compressions3backer supports block-level compression, which minimizes transfer time and storage costs. </p>

<p>Compression is configured via the--compress flag. Compression is automatically enabled when encryption is enabled. </p>

<p>Read-Only AccessAn Amazon S3 account is not required in order to use s3backer.  Of course a filesystem must already exist and have S3 objects with ACL&#39;s configured for public read access (see --accessType below); users should perform the looback mount with the read-only flag (see mount(8)) and provide the --readOnly flag to s3backer.  This mode of operation facilitates the creation of public, read-only filesystems. </p>

<p>Simultaneous MountsAlthough it functions over the network, the s3backer filesystem is not a distributed filesystem and does not support simultaneous read/write mounts.  (This is not something you would normally do with a hard-disk partition either.)  s3backer does not detect this situation; it is up to the user to ensure that it doesn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>Statistics Files3backer populates the filesystem with a human-readable statistics file.  See --statsFilename below. </p>

<p>LoggingIn normal operation s3backer will log via syslog(3).  When run with the -d or -f flags, s3backer will log to standard error. </p>

<p>OK, Where to Next?Try it out! No Amazon S3 account is required. </p>

<p>See the ManPage for further documentation and the CHANGES file for release notes. </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to our LED signs products section. </p>

<p>Light has long fascinated mankind and man-made light source had gone a long way since Edison. The latest trend of light source belongs to LED, a semiconductor light source that emits light in a far more efficient and cost effective way than candescent lights. What exactly is LED? LED is short for Light Emitting Diodes, a multi-color light source that emits color lights based on the movement of electron in a semiconductor. Depending on the chemical used, the color of LED varies: it can be either infrared or visible. </p>

<p>LED has been used in many electronic goods including camera, digital clock, television and more. In particular, its presence in the retail world is ever prevalent with outdoor and indoor LED signs. Lighted signage creates an additional visual effect which further distinguishes itself from traditional signs, making it a more effective advertising tool. LED is used in a variety of ways in outdoor signs: from LED display, electronic business signs and custom signs, to channel letter signs, its versatility is indisputable.  http://www.affordableled.com/ is a LED sign manufacturer specializes in indoor and outdoor signs. http://www.affordableled.com/ wholesales LED signs since 1990 and is known for its quality products, every-day low prices and friendly services. </p>

<p>Quality </p>

<p>A high quality LED sign is not only bright, but also has a wide light-spread angle. Our LED signs come with a higher diode density, making them much brighter than average signs. The more LED bulbs placed on the sign, the brighter the sign is to the viewers. Spreading the light to 180 degree, out LED lights can be seen from all angles and direction.  Price While it is true that there is no free lunch, your economic professor omits to tell you that a good lunch does not have to cost too much either. Price tag is not always the best indicator for a productï¿½s quality, and it is especially true with our LED products. Bypassing the third party distributor, purchasing directly from the LED manufacturer is the safest bet in procuring a good deal on your LED signs. Services At AffordableLED.com, we firmly believe in providing quality products with quality services. Our knowledgeable staff will assist you with every step of the shopping experience to ensure your complete satisfaction.</p>

 title : The digitalsn Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Free software package to establish, manage and maintain a digital signage network. The package will include a web based management tool, a desktop application for the user to manage their digital signage networks and a player to display media files on a system. Sample can be found on my website at http://www.flashap.co.uk </p>

<p>Advertising via digital signage is becoming very popular amongst businesses of all sizes and shapes. This project will develop a software package that will be free for all to use. It will be web based and a module (downloadable) will be installed on the users local pc to manage digital content. Benefits and profits to participants would be the resale of bespoke add-onns in the form of templates to help the end user design their own adverts. The templates will be secured and key driven in order to sustain a reasonable income for the designers. A database of templates will be available for the end users to choose from. This will be purchased via a license key over a certain duration for a number of display screens. </p>

<p>A Digital Signage Network (DSN) is a DIY software system to allow any business to post messages, reminders and briefs across to their employees, clients and business partners in the form of digital messages that is displayed on display screens. Centrally managed and web-based, DSN software incorporates the key constructs of campaigns, markets, schedules and collaboration to enable the efficient distribution of content across networks down to individual media players. This flexibility creates the optimal environment for professional seeking to communicate targeted messages that reach audiences at the right place, at the right time. </p>

<p>All companies function differently and may be largely diversified and geographically apart. For this reason we need to developed a tool to enable different departments or businesses within the company to broadcast messages and therefore participate effectively. From research studies published by Microsoft in 2003 we learn that 48% of employees do not have access to a computer at work to receive messages of any kind. Without these costly systems in place, we regularly rely on the line manager to brief their teams and the accuracy of such briefs may well be inaccurate and/or bias. </p>

<p>With a screen in the right place the problem is solved by delivering news, health &amp; safety briefs, reminders, messages, etc to the screens accurately and timely. Each screen will display the content uploaded by the different users. The application of this broadcast media is endless. </p>

<p>Typical screen locations are: · Lobby area of head office · Open plan offices · Canteen or rest area in office · Reception areas to different departments · Site offices reception area · Site canteen on construction sites · Training rooms </p>

<p>1.3. Benefits of a DSN Real-time messages and information a DSN allows messages and information to be updated on the fly from one remote authoring station and broadcast immediately to audiences regardless of location. </p>

<p>Relevant audiences With digital signage, advertising focuses on the best potential customer: an existing one. Supermarkets have already found that current customers are more likely to purchase products advertised on their digital signs. </p>

<p>Cost savings Every time digital signage users change their message or campaign, they save on printing costs and processing time. It is not surprising that, with all the benefits of digital signage, there are so many uses for it worldwide. They include: · Corporate identity branding · Branch office communication · Corporate communication systems · Emergency announcement systems · Back office employee training · Advertising networks · In-store advertising · Interactive kiosks · Tradeshow displays · Electronic menus and lobby displays · Campus bulletin boards · Community bulletin boards · Arrival and departure schedules · Franchise communication systems</p>
 title : The dotboard Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutDotmatrix is a lightweight, framework independent javascript library used in creating a fast, easy to change marquee style scrolling dot-matrix board on your site. I made it to see if I could, and I&#39;m not sure anyone has a use for it, but if you do, please let me know. It&#39;d make me super pleased to continue working on this project. </p>

<p>InstallationTo install, simply unzip (or untar) the archive files found on the right side of this page, and drop the dotmatrix/ directory into your website. The index.html file merely holds a small demo to show you how dotmatrix works. </p>

<p>SetupSetting up dotmatrix is a pretty straight forward process. It requires only two things: A javascript include in your header A div with the id &#39;dotboard&#39; somewhere in your page </p>

<p>The IncludeIf we open up the index.html page, we see the javascript include right in the  tag. </p>

<p>	Dotboard Demo
<br/>	
<br/>Including the controller is the only include you need to make, however, the system will then perform, behind the scene, some other includes, which you control from the div#dotboard element. </p>

<p>The Dotboard RootDemo dotboard text! Neat!Let&#39;s go a bit deeper into the parameters we can set through this div (all of which, except id are optional). Note: While using the default show factory, any text you enter inside of the dotboard div will become the text used for the show. If you provide no text, you will have to manually set the text it uses. </p>

<p>cols - This sets the default &#39;length&#39; of the dotboard. Defaults to: 9 columns rows - This sets the default &#39;height&#39; of the dotboard. Defaults to: 11 rows lib - This sets the character library that will be used by the dotboard. Uses the default charlib show - This sets which show file will be used to run the dotboard Uses the default show factory Lib(rary) ParameterWithin the dotboard/ directory, there exists a subdirectory named chars/. Within this directory, there is a &#39;default.js&#39; file. If you fail to specify a resource with the &quot;lib&quot; parameter, it will use this &#39;default.js&#39; file. If you create a custom library, you would place it inside of the chars/ directory. If the custom library&#39;s filename was &#39;custom.js&#39;, your lib parameter would be:  lib=&quot;custom&quot; </p>

<p>The system automatically adds the .js extension and reference to the chars/ directory. </p>

<p>Show ParameterWithin the dotboard/ directory, there exists a subdirectory named shows/. Within this directory, there is a &#39;default.js&#39; file. If you fail to specify a resource with the &quot;show&quot; parameter, it will use this &#39;default.js&#39; file. If you create a custom show factory, you would place it inside of the shows/ directory. If the custom show&#39;s filename was &#39;newshow.js&#39;, your show parameter would be:  show=&quot;newshow&quot; </p>

<p>The system automatically adds the .js extension and reference to the shows/ directory. </p>

<p>Building a ShowIf you navigate to dotboard/shows/default.js, you will find the default show factory. Dotboard is merely a rendering engine that creates a field of points, and then turns on/off points within the field. The show factory builds off this rendering engine to move text across the field of points. Within the chars/ directory is a default.js file which contains instructions for the rendering engine to convert Ascii text (any text you type in, like this text here) into the dot-matrix text, so it can be scrolled along. </p>

<p>Now, inside of the dotboard/shows/default.js, there is a function called buildShow(){}. ALL show factories you build must have this buildShow parameter to work with the rendering engine. This build show acts as both the instantiation point for the show factory, and as an opportunity to edit settings within the rendering engine. Let&#39;s take a look at it: </p>

<p>function buildShow(){
<br/>	db.yoff = 1;			// Puts 1px top border on the show
<br/>	show.offset = db.cols;		// Set the left offset to the size of the box, so it starts
<br/>					// blank and scrolls left
<br/>	show.actions = {		// The commands which run our show
<br/>		1: &#39;&gt;&#39;, 			// Start playing the show at Mark 1
<br/>		41: &#39;[&#39;,			// Pause/blink the text at Mark 41
<br/>		75: &#39;]&#39;,			// Stop the pause/blink and resume show at Mark 75
<br/>		end: &#39;@&#39;			// When the show ends, loop back to the start and go fresh
<br/>	};
<br/>	show.size = db.load();		// Load whatever text was in div#dotboard
<br/>	show.init(runShow);		// Initialize the show
<br/>}From this function, you can access any of the dotboard rendering engine settings (db.) and set values in them. The most common function you should probably need to use is the yoff setting. Depending on the size of your dotboard, you may want to push the dots down to center them on the board. All the characters in the default library are 7x9 dots, and the default dotboard size is 9x11. If you wish to have a horizontal setting in this case, you&#39;d set the top offset (yoff) to 1. </p>

<p>show.offset, on the other hand, is an after-rendering offset used by the show factory to move the characters off to the right to alter their starting position. The show factory, by default, sets this value to the number of columns in the dotboard, allowing the show to start blank, and scroll in the text from the left. </p>

<p>show.action allows you to edit how the show plays out. You must provide a literal javascript object (denoted by {}) containing a key:value set of show-time delineation to the action. </p>

<p>Show Actions&#39;&gt;&#39; - Play - To start playing a show, you must include this &#39;Play&#39; character, which will start the show. Normally, this action is placed at the start of a show: {1: &#39;&gt;&#39;} &#39;|&#39; - Pause - To pause a show, set the action character to &#39;|&#39;. When the time delineation is reached, the show will pause until it is again restarted by a &#39;&gt;&#39; action.  &#39;#&#39; - STOP - To stop a show (without being able to restart it), use the &#39;#&#39; action character. When the time delineation is reached, the show will stop, and will only restart when the page is reloaded. &#39;@&#39; - Looping Restart - When a show ends (or when you deem it necessary to start it over), pass in the &#39;@&#39; action character. When this occurs, the show will stop, rewind to the beginning, and run through both the show text and the action script again. &#39;!&#39; - Soft Restart - When a show ends (or when you deem it necessary), pass in the &#39;!&#39; action character. When this occurs, the show will stop, and rewind to the beginning, and run through only the show text again, continuing with the action script from the current delineation. &#39;[&#39; - Pause/Start Blink - If you want to blink text in your show, pass in the &#39;[&#39; action character. This will pause the show, and blink whatever text is currently visible in the dotboard. If you pause the show to initiate a blink, you should only restart the show using the end blink action character (]), and not the play character (&gt;). &#39;]&#39; - End Blink/Resume - When you want a pause/blink action to end, pass in the &#39;]&#39; action character. This will stop the blinking, and resume scrolling the show. Now, let&#39;s build a demo show. Lets say we want to delay the start of a show for 10 show-time delineations. (Each show time delineation is equal to 100 milliseconds, or 1/10th of a second. So 10 show-time delineations is equal to 1 real-time second). Then, we want the scrolling text to go on until 50 delineations, at which time we want to pause the show and blink the currently visible text. Then, we want the text to blink for 50 delineations, at which time, we want to stop the blinking, and resume the show. And when the show ends, we want to loop back to the beginning, and play the exact same show again, complete with the pause/blink action. </p>

<p>In this situation, our action script looks like this: </p>

<p>show.action = {10: &#39;&gt;&#39;, 50: &#39;[&#39;, 100: &#39;]&#39;, end: &#39;@&#39;};Now, lets say we want to make a small edit, and after the show plays through once, we want the text to continue to scroll, but without redoing the blink. We change the end character to a soft restart action character, or: </p>

<p>show.action = {10: &#39;&gt;&#39;, 50: &#39;[&#39;, 100: &#39;]&#39;, end: &#39;!&#39;};if you do not specify show actions, the default show will be: </p>

<p>show.action = {1: &#39;&gt;&#39;, end: &#39;@&#39;};Show TextNow, for the show to work correctly, within our buildShow() function, we must include the following line: </p>

<p>show.size = db.load();The above line of code will load as the show text whatever was placed inside the div#dotboard. If you did not place any text inside of the div#dotboard, or want to use different text than what was inserted, you must provide that text here as the only parameter in the db.load() method.  </p>

<p>So lets say we had no text in div#dotboard, and wanted our text to be: &#39;Dotboard is Great!&#39; </p>

<p>We would edit this line in our buildShow() function to: </p>

<p>show.size = db.load(&#39;Dotboard is Great!&#39;);Starting a ShowFinally, we must pass into the show factory the function which will run the show. The default method is: </p>

<p>show.init(runShow);Which references a show factory helper function (runShow) that manages the actions of the show.</p>

 title : The emergy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is my feeble attempt to create an emergent network, similar to ENTROPY (entropy.stop1984.com), but without the emphasis on anonymity.  Every unique file should have a unique identifier, and there will be working authenticity verification (SSK&#39;s).  The router will be written in C, and will provide a framework for mail clients, message boards, chatrooms, blogs, personal sites, file sharing, etc., without relying on centralized servers.  I don&#39;t want to put too much emphasis on transport encryption, because the general public is likely going to care more about speed than complete anonymity, and I want the emergy-network to be as simple as possible.</p>

 summary : <p>The HooverNI is a tool for observing and fixing notification event queue on Windows Smartphone and Windows PocketPC devices.  </p>

<p>In some cases the queue may be polluted by wrong notification items and this may cause device to work improperly. Possible symptoms can be: absence of alarms and/or notifications from calendar, repeating of an alarm or notification even after you dismissed it. </p>

<p>Cause of the above problems is usually presence of huge amount of so called duplicates in the message queue or damaged events. Windows Mobile itself can not solve this problem automatically and for proper functioning of device usually periodical manual maintenance is required. </p>

<p>This tool helps to determine and remove such items.  </p>

<p>There are several similar tools available in the Internet, which can serve this purpose. I used MemMaid when first faced with the problem. This one however has several advantages to my point: it&#39;s free, it&#39;s highly specialized and thus very simple and I&#39;m going to maintain it for myself and anyone who&#39;s interested in it. </p>

<p>Below is something of which is available in the Internet on this problem: </p>

<p>http://www.expansys.com/ft.aspx?i=129362&amp;thread=13 http://www.aximsite.com/boards/showthread.php?t=116727 http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=46115&amp;start=20&amp;sid=b375545583e36f5bb747aadc64cfee5d http://forums.developerone.com/archive/index.php/t-1766.html </p>

<p>I understand that it&#39;s very important to have notifications and alarms working properly. I&#39;m myself fond of Windows Mobile based devices, but this problem once seemed to me as a true show stopper. Now, after that solved, I&#39;m quite happy with my Qtek S200. Hope this&#39;ll be useful for someone else as well. </p>

 summary : <p>The aim of this project is to design a general data model and application programming interface that can be used to build a family of &#39;Information Task&#39; applications, which are applications that allow to submit, organize, browse, and search items of information. </p>

<p>Examples of such applications include: private and community blogs, portals, resource pages, directories, social tagging systems, bug trackers, message boards, help systems, wikis, forums, and many others. In the future, it seems possible that many systems will be built that draw upon elements that underlie these and similar applications. This project seeks to investigate the technical issues that underpin such a possibility.</p>

 summary : <p>Automatic GUI Folder Synchronization for iPhone/iPod TouchClick the icons below to download the latest version of wiSync </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Important Note: You need to install OpenSSH on your iPhone/iPod Touch and enable Remote Login in your Mac Sharing preferences for this to work. </p>

<p>News: (17/12/2007) Major Update!Great news! wiSync 1.1 is Tiger compatible (Leopard users are unaffected). The native app has had a major overhaul, and there are new options in the mac app (Uninstall and Sync Now). Plus, the mac app features an improved progress bar and cleaner layout. </p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>News: (17/12/2007) Full GUI Version Complete!We are proud to release wiSync v1.0, the result of 2 weeks of continuous work and refinement by the iFrancis team. This version runs completely from the GUI, no terminal windows as promised, and for the first time, we have included a native app - wiToggle - that allows you to control the app&#39;s behaviour from the iPhone, it allows you to force synchronize whenever you want, and even switch automatic synchronization on and off.  </p>

<p>We hope you enjoy this release, and we are proud to launch the app on the ModMyiFone boards at www.modmyifone.com/wisync , where we will provide support if needed, and where a userguide will be created shortly to help you make the best of this app! </p>

<p>In celebration of the 5000&#39;th download of iSync since its first release 2 weeks ago, we would like to announce that the new fully-gui app with no terminal prompts is close to finished, and we are giving you a sneak peek of what the fully released app will look like! This is the culmination of hours of work and many sleepless nights, and most of the credit goes to godsmash, the coder who helped make the Full GUI port a reality. The screenshot below is a sneak peek of what the GUI is going to look like - click the image to visit the source code SVN repository! </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Update (12/7/2007) Final Beta Version Released:Fantastic news! The final beta version of iSync has been released. This release is guaranteed to work on all macs. The method by which the app calls the GUI has had a major overhaul and this means that the app will now &quot;just work&quot; for everyone. No need to set it to run in terminal or anything, and no more problems involving text not appearing in the text fields. </p>

<p>The best news, however, is that this is the final version of iSync that uses a GUI maker, we have a new c++ coder on board, godshadow. The next release will have its own Cocoa GUI, everything will run from within the GUI so no more annoying terminal windows, and you will only have to enter a password once. </p>

<p>More importantly, though, is that we are now in active development of wifi calendar and contacts synchronization, and this makes itunes synchronization that much closer to mass availability. Additionally, the new app will enable &#39;true&#39; automatic sync, any time you make a change to the sync dir, your iPod/iPhone will be updated, and vice versa. Also, the new app will have an iTunes-like interface for simplicity, and when iTunes support is enabled, you will be able to see your sync dir and your playlists within the app. </p>

<p>And for those of you who are windows users, you can rejoice, because we will finally have windows support in the next 2 weeks. Those of you who use linux, support for your OS will come even sooner than that! </p>

<p>Bear with us though, but the app will be out of beta by then, and it will have its official launch at http://www.ModMyiFone.com Obviously because of trademark issues, we need to change the name of the app to something less provocative. We haven&#39;t decided what to call it yet, but we&#39;ll come up with something  </p>

<p>Update (12/6/2007) Version 0.7 Released:Finally, v0.7 is out and it includes, due to requests by many users, for the first time, a native iPhone app that allows you to switch automatic sync on and off! This feature would not have been possible without mbranes of MMi, thanks for your help! </p>

<p>Added ability to change iPod/iPhone root password on user request, instructions within app are much clearer and users are now notified if the setup succeeded rather than the plain |Process Completed| logout message that terminal gives. This release also includes major improvements to the GUI. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Update (11/27/2007) Version 0.5 Released:Minor revision to 0.4c to include an &quot;Add IP&#39;s for New Network&quot; feature. Minor script efficiency changes and a slightly different interface layout. </p>

<p>Version 0.4c Released - Installer Package Included!A new version of iSync for iPhone/iPod Touch has been released. For those of you who have been holding out on running iSync, this is the time to do it. This version is probably the most major release yet, and implements more features and fixes than the last 3 releases combined! </p>

<p>1. iSync is now packaged in an installer. No need to worry about Finder.app being on the desktop anymore, all files are now in your Applications directory inside the folder &quot;iSync&quot; </p>

<p>2. Battery life enhancement is no longer forced, users can now choose to keep openssh running by unticking the relevant checkbox in iSync With the use of Toggle (provided with iSync), users can easily switch to battery life enhancement, disable iSync altogether, re-enable it, or completely uninstall everything. </p>

<p>3. iSync will store your previous settings (Sync dirs etc) so that if you ever need to re-install using iSync or uninstall using Toggle, the fields will be filled in for you, making it a one-click procedure. </p>

<p>4. Along with 300 more bugfixes (ok not 300, but if Steve Jobs can lie, why can&#39;t I?)  </p>

<p>News of iTunes Support:There is apparently an implementation extremely similar to mine (use of rsync and scp), but for Windows, that synchronizes with Winamp using the ml_ipod plugin. This method is not mac compatible (obviously because of winamp), at least not yet, but I have reached a breakthrough that has allowed me to synchronize my own iPod Touch over wi-fi with an older version of iTunes. This is good news, but using an older version of iTunes is not the solution as it required a good bit of hacking and hex editing, including making changes on the iPod that could be considered seriously dangerous. I am working on getting iTunes 7.5 support and it basically revolves around these issues: </p>

<p>1. Mounting the iPod over ssh as a remote drive using sshfs and MacFUSE. 2. The hard part: Tricking iTunes into thinking the iPod ssh drive is connected via USB 3. Failing that, getting iTunes to synchronize with a local folder on the computer (yes I know - crude) and then getting the iPod to synchronize with that folder. </p>

<p>As you can see the problem involves tricking iTunes into recognizing something as an iPod which is NOT technically an iPod. </p>

<p>Anyway, enjoy this release and your new portable wi-fi disk </p>

<p>Upon request, I have modified the utility to provide an option for installing the awesome &quot;MobileFinder&quot; on the iPhone/iPod. Shell script commands are slightly more efficient now, and the execution is slightly more verbose, indicating to the user that an error has occurred and why it has occurred. </p>

<p>Note: You must put the included Finder.app file on your desktop for the installation to succeed. A workaround for this issue involving an installation package is in the works, but it should work fine for now if you simply place Finder.app on the desktop yourself. </p>

<p>The following instructions are also provided with the app: </p>

<p>Make sure you have installed the BSD Subsystem and OpenSSH on your jailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch from Installer. Fill in the required fields.  </p>

<p>Your iPhone/iPod Touch MUST be powered on and unlocked, with Wi-Fi connected to the same network as your Mac, otherwise the utility will fail. If the above conditions are met but the utility still fails, please ensure that your router allows connections on port 22. </p>

<p>When you press OK, the application window will be replaced by a terminal screen. You will get a few prompts as the script enables ssh_authkey authentication from your iPod/iPhone to your Mac. The whole process is extremely streamlined, and will take no longer than 2 minutes! Now fill up your Mac&#39;s sync dir with stuff and you&#39;re set to go! </p>

<p>Planned features: </p>

<p>1. Synchronize iTunes library over Wi-Fi </p>

<p>2. Synchronize Photos over Wi-Fi </p>

<p>3. Synchronize Bookmarks, Contacts etc over Wi-Fi </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for developers with experience using shell scripts and ssh and especially iTunes library access to help out with the development of this little app. Wireless iTunes synchronization is something many of us iPhone/iPod Touch users want badly, and since nobody else has decided to do anything about it until now, this would be a good place to start. </p>

<p>Icons for iSync are from the awesome CrystalXP.net iPhone icon pack</p>
 title : The kareha Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kareha is a message board script. It is more loosely modelled after the sort of message board scripts used on 2ch and many other similar sites. It tries to use modern structured XHTML and CSS layout. It does not need a database backend.</p>

<p>Wakaba and Kareha are my attempts at implementing from scratch image and message boards of a type popular in Japan (used on sites such as 2ch and Futaba). This kind of board software is built around anonymous posting and no requirements for registration, to make the boards more suited for casual uses, and more fun overall. They are written in Perl, and are designed to be more efficient and cleanly written than the original scripts that are available, while preserving the same kind of functionality. Both scripts are in use at iichan, an English-language site built along the same lines as the Japanese 2chan, and also 4-ch, an English-language discussion BBS.</p>
 title : The logic-puzzle-toolkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Logic Puzzle Toolkit provides an extensible framework to play and create logic puzzles. These puzzles are of the style found Nikoli magazine, Otto Janko&#39;s Raetsel site, and in the works of Zotmeister and GLMathGrant. This project aims to an easy way to create and test new types of puzzles, and create more puzzles of existing types. It accomplishes this through a modular solver and puzzle generator framework, which is easily extensible with python classes implementing new game types. </p>

<p>Currently the project has a working solver, which is puzzle-type agnostic. It uses a novel search technique, where it uses python generator functions to control the flow of the search in a manner similar to breadth first search, but modified for the domain of logic puzzles. </p>

<p>There are 6 puzzle types, on 3 types of grids, with more on the way. GUI is functional, but bare bones, and is not yet integrated with the solver. Puzzle creation tools have not been started.</p>

<p>What is sirlame?Sirlame is an open source messaging system that can be described as a hybrid between a forum system and a chat system. It is written in php and mysql. It can also be described as the greatest web application ever made, you know cows never lie, right? </p>

<p>recent updatessirlame 0.1.3 releasedWe realize that there is still a lot to do before we make it to .3 (alot of issues yet to be fixed that we want gone by .3), so be on the look out for .2.2 in the near future. This release fixes a bunch of bugs and is recommended for everyone to upgrade to. </p>

<p>sirlame 0.1.2 releasedHooray! After almost a month of developing, adding, deleting, fixing, and winning, sirlame 0.1.2 is released and ready for your greedy paws. Here are some of the new features: </p>

<p>A plugins system which allows both installation and uninstallation of plugins An infinate amount of boards Admin function such as delete and edit Enjoy this new release, and please submit all bugs to the issue tracker. Also, since sirlame is currently in a pre-release stage, there isn&#39;t an updater at this time (also because there are 0 downloads for sirlame 0.1) </p>

<p>plugins systemAs of this revision, sirlame now has basic support for plugins. If you&#39;re a developer and you&#39;re interested in creating a plugin, feel free to follow the guide in includes/plugins/sample.plugin.php and this wiki entry. When we complete this plugins system, we will work for a week or so on bugs, then we will try to release sirlame 0.2 codenamed &quot;this one doesn&#39;t suck, we promise&quot; </p>

<p>sirlame 0.1.1 -  releasedafter the last failure with sirlame 0.1, we&#39;ve gotten our acts together and now have a relatively stable version here. Some new features are: </p>

<p>AJAX loading of replies instead of loading a new page Admin posts that are colored differently to stick out An installer that does pretty much everything to get you setup without having to modify any code As always, we hope you enjoy sirlame, but please help us out by reporting any bugs to the issue tracker, seriously, we love eliminating bugs and adding features for you. This release also comes with a change in licensing, sirlame is now under the Creative Commons 3.0 BY license. We feel that this is a fair and suitable license for the project.  </p>

<p>source released - 11/05/08Sirlame is now open source. We will be coming out with an official release sometime this weekend, but until then, you can use the repo to get your hands on a copy, just be aware that the installer is not functioning at the moment, so you&#39;ll need to edit the config file manually. If you do decide to test the system, please report all bugs to the bug tracker so we can try to get rid of them. If you have any feature requests, comments, etc. go ahead and post them on the discussion group.</p>

<br/>tmlinux includes a standard linux kernel (based on linux-2.6.14 and applied with some celinux patches), a uclibc and a busybox. All of them are well tested using uclibc testsuite and LTP testsuite. You can get uclibc, busybox and toolchain from this project&#39;s SVN repository, and you can get linux kernel source tree from github.com using the following command: </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/camelguo/linux-2.6-trimedia.git </p>

<p>Newstmlinux passed LTP project on PNX1005 simulator. tmlinux passed LTP project on MBE1500 board. And now it is available for application developers to develop their applications on it. We are trying to port tmlinux on  MBE-1500 board. It is sponsored by NXP. We have released an SDK for application developers based on tmlinux of PNX1005. Application developers can build and run tmlinux pnx1005 applications on ttisim using this SDK. We will release the complete source code after complete testing. We are trying to port tmlinux onto pnx1005 (strictly speaking only tm3282 -- the core to PNX1005) and have done most development jobs. We are trying our best to release it as soon as possible.

 title : The application-retirement Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Applications that are candidates for retirement consume computing resources, storage, and manpower to maintain yet provide very little business benefit to the organization. Often, applications that support hundreds of users at rollout are later used by very few.  While the majority of IT budgets support existing applications, very little attention is typically paid to the total cost of maintaining an application. </p>

<p>Application retirement is a viable strategy for eliminating redundant legacy applications, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.  By reducing the number of applications within the IT infrastructure, DBAs can concentrate on maintaining critical business applications with the highest value to the organization instead of compiling data from disparate sources.</p>
 title : The argot-hub Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>argot-hub is the home of a collection of vocabularies or word-bundles (an argot), that can be used to describe data. The range of argots is wide, and they can either be used on their own, or with others. </p>

<p>This flexibility is possible because the core technology on which an argot is built is RDF. </p>

<p>Unlike traditional argots, our argots aim to make information available to everyone. </p>

<p>Discussion about any of the vocabularies here, takes place on the Argot Hub Google Group. </p>

<p>ApproachBundlesWhilst it might often appear that we need a specific set of terms that are applicable to one particular task, when it comes to organising these terms it is much more useful to create small bundles that can be reused in many places. </p>

<p>For example, to describe a job vacancy we will often need to describe an organisation that will be the employer. But when it comes to creating terms for a consultation we also need to indicate an organisation. It obviously makes sense for the terminology to be consistent, so that any vocabulary that needs to refer to organisations can use the same terms. And for this reason we create an organisation &#39;bundle&#39; that can be reused inside other &#39;bundles&#39;. </p>

<p>ReuseAs far as possible the terms used in a bundle should come from existing vocabularies. For example, if we need to indicate the start and end dates for a consultation, we use the appropriate Dublin Core terms. Similarly the title of a consultation or job vacancy description can be provided by the Dublin Core title property. </p>

<p>An argot is therefore a collection of terms for a particular use, but those terms could be drawn from a variety of vocabularies. </p>

<p>Current bundlesThe current list of bundles is </p>

 summary : <p>A text mode console application for controlling the WowWee Rovio mobile webcam robot. Video feed is converted to ASCII, and drive commands are issued from the keyboard. </p>

<p>Rovio works just fine with Linux because it&#39;s controls are browser based. I did think it would be quite amusing though to have a special console interface to the Rovio, naturally text based and running in a terminal. Since the idea of it amused me so, I went ahead and made one. Because I like free software I&#39;ll provide it here to the world.  </p>

 title : The dividere Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DividereAvailable in English and German! Verfügbar in Englisch und Deutsch! </p>

<p>Why should I use Dividere? </p>

<p>It is Open Source. It is completely free. It is compatible to HJSplit. It is operating system independent. Use it everywhere on every machine. It is fast! It fully supports multiple processors. </p>

<p>DescriptionThis small application allows splitting and joining files. Sometimes large files can be very unhandy to use. For example, you have a file with a size of several Gigabyte and you want to store on CDs. Dividere helps you to split the file into the right size. If you need the original file, just join it with Dividere. It is that easy! </p>

<p>The focus of Dividere is simplicity. A lean and clear user interface is the result. The program is written in Java, therefore, it can be used on all operating systems. Dividere uses the Java Web Start technology to run on your computer. This means that you will always have the latest version installed and you will automatically benefit from all future updates. </p>

<p>Download and InstallJust click on the install-and-launch-link: Install and launch _Dividere_! </p>

<p>Note: Dividere requires the Java version 6 or higher. If you need Java, go to www.java.com and install the latest version. When Dividere is installed, you are asked if you trust the program. This is a security mechanism from the Java Web Start technology. Dividere needs this permission, so it can write on your hard disk. </p>

<p>Thank you for using Dividere! </p>

<p>BeschreibungDieses kleine Programm erlaubt es Dateien in beliebig große Teile zu teilen und sie wieder zusammenzufügen. Große Dateien können oftmals unpraktisch sein, z.B. wenn man eine Datei mit mehreren Gigabyte auf CD-ROMs sichern will. Genau hier kommt Dividere ins Spiel. Das Programm erlaubt dir aus einer Datei mehrere kleine Dateien zu erzeugen. Wenn man die Original-Datei wiederherstellen will, muss man einfach nur die Teile mittels Dividere zusammenfügen. Ganz einfach! </p>

<p>Das Hauptaugenmerk bei Dividere ist Einfachheit. Eine schlanke und verständliche Benutzungsschnittstelle ist das Resultat. Das Programm ist in Java geschrieben. Dies hat den Vorteil, dass es plattformunabhängig ist und auf praktisch jedem Betriebssystem verwendet werden kann. Dividere benutzt dabei die Java Web Start Technologie. Mittels dieser Technologie wird das Programm immer auf den aktuellsten Stand gehalten und du profitierst von allen zukünftigen Aktualisierungen. </p>

<p>Herunterladen und InstallierenEinfach auf den Herunterladen-und-Installieren-Link klicken: Herunterladen und Installieren _Dividere_! </p>

<p>Beachte: Dividere benötigt Java in der Version 6 oder höher. Solltest du noch kein Java installiert haben, dann besuche einfach www.java.com. Beim Installationsvorgang wirst du gefragt, ob du Dividere vertraust. Dies ist eine Sicherheitsmaßnahme von Java Web Start. Dividere braucht diese Freigabe um Dateien erstellen zu können. </p>

<p>Vielen Dank! </p>

User can exclude some pages from size calculations in auto mode Automatic exclusion of pages from size calculations in auto mode based on statistical analysis. User can confirm each page exclusion separately as well as confirm all exclusions at once. This mode can be mixed with manual page exclusion.    </p>

<p>NewAuto2 mode - pdfcrop will try to fit page content by moving crop box before resizing it. This should result in bit smaller output dimensions (while still content fits in). In this mode additional option is supported to set page corner to which crop box should be aligned. TODOCode optimization/rewriting - move from patch to application.

 title : The squarejelly Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Status:PRE-ALPHA </p>

<p>Last status change: 2007.12.09 </p>

<p>Squarejelly is still under initial development and is only intended for developers at this time. </p>

<p>Introduction:An extensible web application framework for rapid development of Object based data objects that are accessible via AJAX. </p>

<p>So what is this all about anyway?SquareJelly is a self-contained foundation for any website where database driven functionality is desired. </p>

<p>Database driven content may include a guestbook, inventory listing, to-do lists, etc. </p>

<p>The key to SquareJelly is that you tell it what you want to store in the database and it automatically creates the user interfaces to manage the content and server connections using modern web 2.0 technologies such as Rich DHTML interfaces ( Dojo-Toolkit ), AJAX and JSON. </p>

 title : The storjsdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Webアプリケーションの表現力が広がり、世界中の人がWebでつながるようになった。一方で、サービスを広く継続的に運用するためには、依然として多くの難しい問題が残っている。サービスを運用するためには、サーバ運用管理のノウハウと、利用状況の事前予測に基づいた設備投資が必要となる。 </p>

<p>本プロジェクトは、オンラインストレージを利用するJavaScript用データベースシステム（StorJsDB：online STORage based JavaScript DataBase system）を開発する。StorJsDBは、JavaScriptライブラリとしてデータベース操作機能を提供する。StorJsDBに格納されたデータは、オンラインストレージ上に置かれる。これまでサービス提供者のサーバを通して行われていた多くの処理は、StorJsDBを利用することで、クライアントとオンラインストレージの間で直接行われるようになる。これにより、サーバ運用管理にコストをかけずに大規模なサービスをリリースすることが可能となる。 </p>

 title : The tabbedimages Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A very simple IronPython application. IronPython is an implementation of Python for the dotnet platform. </p>

<p>The Tabbed Image Viewer can view multiple images, in tabpages, and save images in different formats. It can copy images to the clipboard, and paste images from the clipboard into a new tab. It also supports drag and drop and has a clipboard viewer (will auto-paste images from the clipboard into a new tab - useful for screenshots). All in 500 lines of IronPython code. </p>

<p>Created as a simple demo of IronPython and Windows Forms, for PyCon 2007. </p>

<p>It is tested on Windows, and although it works on Mono there are minor issues. </p>

<p>There is a package available for download, including all the source files, and a Windows executable. (The .NET framework 2.0 redistributable must be installed.) </p>

<p>Alternatively, the whole project can be obtained with Subversion. </p>

<p>There is a sample Visual Studio project (C#) which is a simple example of embedding the IronPython engine (for IronPython 1) to create a custom executable, plus an example of extending IronPython with a C# class. </p>

 title : The timetablepublisher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The TimeTablePublisher  is a single system that allows a transit agency to examine, modify, and transform raw scheduling data into easy-to-read timetables for customer information purposes.  The application simplifies and accelerates the production of printed on-street schedules and web schedules, which is often a very time-consuming and manual process for most agencies.  This results in more accurate, current, and consistent schedule information for the customer. </p>

<p>The TimeTablePublisher is designed to use data directly in the Google Transit Feed Spec (GTFS) format, so it can be very easy for an agency to implement.  In addition, it can connect to, and read from, other sources of data including a database, a comma separated text file, and XML.  An easy-to-use interface, as well as a tool that compares the changes between two service dates, makes it easy to format and edit the data. </p>

<p>As an open sources application, TimeTablePublisher is available for free so that other transit agencies can use it and even contribute enhancements to it.  There&#39;s always room for improvement; and with your help, TimeTablePublisher will improve. </p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS: </p>

<p>1. Use the war file (look right).  Just drop it into your TOMCAT/webapps directory.  It will unpack itself, and you should see a TOMCAT/webapps/ttpub directory (assuming tomcat is running). </p>

<p>2. Use the test GTFS data (again, look right).  This data-set very is small, and thus provides a good sanity check that TimeTablePublisher (TTPUB) is properly configured on your machine. </p>

<p>3. It&#39;s been reported that 512 megs is just not enough memory to run TTPUB with real schedule data.  GTFS data is really big, and TTPUB is really bad at memory management.  The minimum memory on your system should be 1.5 GB -- you&#39;re recommended to be dedicating 1G (eg: JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xmx1024m&quot;) of memory to TTPUB.</p>

 title : The adp-rocket-analysis-tool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RAT has been accepted into the Apache Incubator. This project is being retained only for history purposes. Please see Apache RAT for current developments. </p>

<p>RAT helps with release auditing for open source projects.  </p>

<p>Auditing a release is a slow and tedious business. RAT aims to automate and speed this process. </p>

<p>This is based on an Apache Incubator itch: lots of projects new to Apache which want to create releases compliant with Apache policy. Auditing these to check that all appropriate source files have license headers, that required documents are in the right places and that there are no incompatible licenses is tedious and time consuming. </p>

<p>RAT is coded in Java to easily allow a cross-platform UI to be added but its auditing is not restricted to a particular language.</p>

 title : The m-fit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Na área de Editoração de Vídeos, uma das maiores demandas é a detecção de transição de  tomadas, que é basicamente o corte de uma tomada e o inicio de outra, o que é útil para  diversas aplicações, como indexação, recuperação, análise e edição de vídeos. Estas  transições podem ocorrer de diversas formas, tais como: zooms, cortes, fades, dissolves.  Este trabalho apresenta o M-FIT Motion Finder Integration, um framework que possibilitará o  reconhecimento automático das transições de tomadas de cenas a partir de uma determinada  amostragem de imagens (frames de um filme) através do uso de técnicas de Ritmo Visual e  Morfologia Matemática, permitindo que o ponto exato da transição seja obtido de uma maneira  mais prática e rápida. O M-FIT é uma ferramenta desenvolvida em linguagem C, com utilização  de OpenCV (biblioteca para computação visual). Sua interface é feita com a utilização da  ferramenta QT, tornando o M-FIT um sistema com uma interface simples e de fácil  entendimento, a qual terá diversos atalhos para outras funcionalidades do sistema. </p>

<p>Este projeto foi feito na FEI e ganhou 2 prêmios: </p>

 title : The poka-yoke Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Poka-yoke is a static analysis tool that uses regular expressions to find defects. </p>

<p>The idea behind poka-yoke is similar to the philosophy that underpins the Japanese management strategy of the same name. </p>

<p>Humans make mistakes and programmers are human beings. The trick to making mistakes is to never repeat them. Poka-yoke allows you to write regular expressions that capture the essence of that kind of error and once written you can check every file in your code-base for defects of that type. </p>

<p>Poka-yoke is design to pick up &quot;stupid&quot; defects rather than be an advanced static analysis tool.  </p>

<p>The project is broken in to two phases. The first is to build a command line application that can be put in to NANT scripts and CruiseControl. This allows you to prevent defects slipping in to your code-base undetected. </p>

<p>The second phase is to write a Visual Studio plug-in that detects the error the moment it is written.</p>

 title : The clipboard-image-publisher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What: Clipboard Image Publisher is software program written in Java that enables the user to publish print screen images quickly. </p>

<p>Why: I send emails with print screen images all the time in my current email client Mozilla Thunderbird. It is really easy. Hit the Print Screen button and hit Control-V into the email body. I am using Gmail more and Thunderbird less. To insert a screen print in Gmail you paste it from the clipboard into to an image program like MS Paint or Gimp, save it to a file and add it to your Gmail message as an attachement. Or, you can publish the screen print image to a public web site, pull up that image in your browser and then drag it to your Gmail message. I prefer the later. </p>

<p>How: The user holds down the Alt key and hits the print screen key. The operating system sends an image of the current window to the system clipboard. When the user presses the Publish button in Clipboard Image Publisher it saves the image to the local hard drive in a temporary file. It then sends that file to a servlet hosted at my website patrickarchibald.com. The program then launches the default web browser to display the published image. The user can drag and drop the link into a Gmail message. There is also an Edit button. Click this to edit the image prior to publishing it. The program will launch whatever program you have assigned to .png files. I have Gimp assigned on my system. To change what program is assigned to .png files edit File Types in Windows Explorer. </p>

<p>Requirements: The program is written Java. You will need Java 1.4 or better to install and run it. It has been tested on Windows XP Professional and Windows Media Center Edition. It will not run properly on non-Windows systems. Other operating systems handle the clipboard differently and launching programs differently. </p>

<p>Limitations: Each screen shot must be 500,000 bytes or less. No more than 10 images published per IP address per day are allowed. Depending on my disk usage the images may be deleted after 7 days.</p>
 summary : <p>In MASTER FIRST YEAR in Montpellier-II university, </p>

<p>we must programe a image compressor, we don&#39;t decided tu use JPEG or GIF, we created the .grol format. </p>

<p>the algorithm is simple: detect rectangles in Y, Cr or Cb masks. (Y U V) </p>

<p>and we store there rectangles in a binary file. </p>

<p>we can open this binary file to open and read the images. </p>

<p>today this project sent to our responsibles, </p>

<p>the user interface is the principal goal. because with this, we can, like photoshpo or the gimp, activate the interactive mode, and display all the masks, and the statistics of the compressor. </p>

<p>write in JAVA 5.0,  this software is designed to the research. </p>

<p>if you want to continue thisproject, send us a mail, and we will give you the password for upload (if you are interessed). </p>

<p>this software contains some bugs, in the file-open operation. but operations of compression and visualisation is 100% operational. </p>

 summary : <p>Provide an erlang mapping to the image magick library. This will give erlang users access to an advanced imaging library and in particular web developers using yaws will be able to add graphic manipulation.</p>
 title : The every-image-generator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Infiniti machine is an art project that involves the manipulation of very large integers to generate images. Once the image is generated, it can be manipulated by increasing or decreasing the integer it is based upon. Ideally a person interacting with the piece would be able to change the value of the integer in any direction and see the results displayed as a 640x480 bitmap. Additionally the user will be able to zoom in and out on the number-image, flip and rotate it, and even generate a song based on the binary output of the integer.</p>

 title : The fpga-image-registration Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Image registration (the process of finding the mathematical relationship between pixels in one image to pixels in another) is an essential task in many computer vision applications; however, the problem is under-constrained and potentially unsolvable.  The goal is to perform image registration on an FPGA in real-time, using as few resources as possible, and producing accurate frame-to-frame registration transformations between images.  As embedded projects are almost never hardware independent, our goal is to clearly separate the vendor specific modules as to allow for relatively straight-forward porting to other platforms.  Due to license restrictions, anything created with a vendor&#39;s wizard will not be able to be included in this project, and instructions/non-encumbered project files will be provided to allow legal creation of these files.  It is not  currently a goal of the project to be able to simulate everything intended for synthesis; however, this may change if there is a need for it.  There will also be a high-level language version of the code available in C/C++ or Matlab (depending on the direction the project takes) that will produce results that will be compared to the hardware version for verification of each component.</p>

 summary : <p>A desktop program that lets you choose as many images as you want from your file system and then upload them all to a image hosting site that does not provide a way to upload many files at once (like the Facebook interface, for example) </p>

<p>Whishlist:Add more services: http://flickr.com, http://mekusharim.co.il, http://showme.co.il Add a GUI to album creation. Add panel for the images that will uploaded. Add tab for viewing the online album Add Drag &amp; Drop feature between the two tabs. Add De/Select All with key binding to the images panel. Installation:Download and extract the jar file and the lib folder in same directory, then double click the jar file or type this command from the shell: </p>

<p>cd path/to/image-batch-uploader/folder
<br/>java -jar &quot;ImageUploader.jar&quot;Requirements:Java 1.6 Internet Connectivity ;) How to Use:type username and password choose the web hosting service you want to upload to. wait until the albums combo box filled (the box after the services combobox) choose an album from the combobox choose folder from your file system mark files to upload click on &quot;Upload&quot; button and wait until the progress bar finish. Enter your web album with the browser and share your friens :).</p>
 title : The image-boxmodel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a perl module for image manipulation. It internally uses some sort of a box model - known from css - to avoid conflicts between elements. An element can be &quot;everything&quot;: text, images, charts.. </p>

<p>The module has different backends to ensure same user code whatever image library is used (GD / Image-Magick ..). There will be more backends in the future. </p>

<p>The object oriented approach should make it easy to write backends and to write wrappers which use basic functionality of the module and offer an easier use for common tasks.</p>

 title : The image-directory-smurfer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>28 July 2006:  This code is hardly finished, but I just wanna try Google&#39;s code hosting.  That said,</p>

<p>This is a set of perl scripts that will let me make a useable interface for people to view pictures on my site.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have accumulated a pile of images stored in various directories on my site.  I&#39;m not willing to move any of the existing pictures to fit the directory structures needed by other photo album tools.  No 404s for me, thank you!</p>

<p>You should *not* use this code if you are starting a new album.  Use any of the well-coded, well-tested, well-supported albums out there.  Gallery, Coppermine, etc etc.</p>

<p>In fact, do not use this code at all; it&#39;s not finished.</p>

<p>Design requirements:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Nothing in my current, chaotic image directory has to change.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Handle unlimited directories, unlimited filename lengths, etc.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Automagically create tables in database</p>

 summary : <p>The main idea was to straighten rectangular images after scanning them to maintain the precision as close to ideal as possible. I&#39;ll try to use this for maps. As this software evolves I intend it to be able to correct any sort of distortions to images. </p>

<p>ExampleLet&#39;s say you have an image distorted like this: </p>

<p>(note that the bounding line that should appear in the resulting image as a rectangle is marked using numbered points and it is not inside the image itself) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The result will look like this: </p>

 title : The jquery-image-hover Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jQuery ImgHoverOverviewImgHover is a simple way to use hovering image on your site. </p>

<p>You can use fade effect to switch hovering images as well. </p>

<p>UsageIf you want to provide hovering behaviour to all the images, you can write simply like below; </p>

<p>$(document).ready(function(){
<br/>  $(&#39;img&#39;).imghover();
<br/>});When mouse-over this image, file &quot;/your/path/original_o.gif&quot; shows on the element. </p>

<p>Bulk SettingYou can call this method on the elements other than images as well. </p>

<p>$(document).ready(function(){
<br/>  $(&#39;div.image-container&#39;).imghover();
<br/>});In this case, ImgHover provides the function to the images under &#39;image-container&#39; element. </p>

<p>OptionsprefixCreate hovered image by original image name and prefix. </p>

<p>$(&#39;img&#39;).imghover({prefix: &#39;hover/&#39;});In this case, &quot;/your/path/hover/image1.gif&quot; will be provided as hovered image. </p>

<p>Default value is null. </p>

<p>suffixCreate hovered image by original image name and suffix. </p>

<p>$(&#39;img&#39;).imghover({suffix: &#39;-hovered&#39;});In this case, &quot;/your/path/image1-hovered.gif&quot; will be provided as hovered image. </p>

<p>Default value is &#39;o&#39;. # for my colleagues ;-p </p>

<p>srcSpecify hovered image. </p>

<p>Defautl value is null. </p>

<p>btnOnlyWhen ImgHover was called to container element(s), the function find only </p>

<p> or  with anchor link. This option is useful to avoid empty gif, site logo and so on. </p>

<p>Default value is true. </p>

<p>fadeYou can use fade effect to switch images. </p>

<p>Default value is false. </p>

<p>fadeSpeedThe speed of fade effect. </p>

<p>Default value is 500.</p>
 title : The jquery-rotate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis library is an extension for jQuery to rotate images directly within JavaScript. Good in situations where you want to organize your thumbnails without the lag of synchronous image operations via the web server. </p>

<p>ImplementationTwo JavaScript image handling implementations are supported: </p>

<p>using DXImageTransform filter for Microsoft Internet Explorer using Canvas object for other browsers </p>

<p>The library has been tested with: </p>

<p>Mozilla FireFox 2.0.0.2 Internet Explorer 7.0 Opera 9.1 (note Opera 8 is not supported) </p>

<p>Functions.rotate(angle,[whence=relative])</p>

<p>.rotateLeft([angle=90])</p>

<p>.rotateRight([angle=90])GuideThe library should be loaded after the jquery.js. Once the library is loaded, you can rotate images by calling rotateLeft([angle=90]) or rotateRight([angle=90]) on the jQuery object, like this: </p>

<p>$(&#39;#theimage&#39;).rotateLeft();From version 1.1, this library also supports arbitrary angles, in degrees: </p>

<p>$(&#39;#theimage&#39;).rotateRight(45);NotesSafari is not yet supported, but according to the specs it should work. Any help on this would be appreciated. As the old image gets replaced with each rotation, none of its onXXX events are copied either. Internet Explorer also rotates the border around an image, the other browsers don&#39;t</p>

 title : The mercurius Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionMercurius is an on-going project to assist fitness training. </p>

<p>The goals of this project is to have an online social and fitness educational community where users can upload and track information pertaining to exercise (e.g. time, activity, heart rate data, calories, etc.), measurements (e.g. weight, fat percentage, resting pulse, etc.), and diet (calories, fat, carbs, protein, vitamins and minerals, etc.).  Since education and online social is the focus of this project, it has been built on top of Moodle and can be easily installed onto existing Moodle installations. </p>

<p>Another goal of this project is to assist in automating much of these points by predicting data, use caching, and automatic importing from external devices (e.g. Timex HR &amp; GPS data). </p>

<p>Also, to share information with other users (e.g. trails you have run) and to view your information from multiple locations (e.g. iGoogle Gadget, Dash Express GPS, mobile phones, etc.). </p>

<p>Current StatusAt the moment the project&#39;s status is alpha and on-going development is still in progress.

 summary : <p>Movable Type — лучший инструмент для блогингаMovable Type — это бесплатная платформа для блогинга, отличающаяся мощностью, гибкостью и удобством работы. Движок разрабатывается профессионалами, постоянно добавляются новые функции, а текущие совершенствуются. 
<br/>Мы называем этот движок лучшим не просто так. Многое из того, что появляется в Movable Type, впоследствии вы можете увидеть и в других движках. Инновационный подход и экспериментальный дух разработчиков, а также компания, хорошо зарекомендовавшая себя в мире блогинга — это три составляющих, благодаря которым каждый пользователь MT остаётся доволен своим выбором. 
<br/>А кое-кто даже сравнивает Movable Type с продукцией компании Apple — такой же удобной, простой и красивой.  
<br/>ДемоВы можете испытать Movable Type в действии, не устанавливая платформу на свой сервер. Специально для этого создан сайт www.movabletype4.org, где можно протестировать последнюю версию MT (на английском языке). 
<br/>Скачать Movable TypeСкачайте локализованную версию Movable Type, в которой уже есть русский язык, а также произведены некоторые изменения, способствующие более лучшей работе с русским языком. 
<br/>Полный список измений доступен на специальной странице. 
<br/>Скачать Movable Type 4.23, русская версия
<br/>Основные функции Movable TypeПоддержка неограниченного количества блогов на одной инсталляции Независимо от того, что для вас блогинг — просто увлечение или профессиональное дело — в MT вы можете создать столько блогов, сколько захотите. Они могут распологаться не только в подпапках, но и на отдельных доменах. 
<br/>Статическая и динамическая публикация По умолчанию Movable Type генерирует статические файлы, это положительно сказывается на производительности сервера. 
<br/>Удобное управление медиа файлами В Movable Type встроен удобный менеджер файлов, с помощью которого можно управлять изображениями, видео, аудио или любыми другими файлами. 
<br/>Мощная система шаблонов С помощью шаблонов вы можете легко настроить, как внешний вид вашего блога, так и формат публикуемых файлов. Например, можно публиковать файлы с уже привычным расширением .html, а можно использовать и другие расширения (php, asp, txt, css, js, pdf, doc, и т.д.). 
<br/>Пользовательские роли В Movable Type по умолчанию уже имеется несколько стандартных ролей (администраторы, редакторы, комментаторы, авторы, дизайнеры), с помощью которых можно чётко разделить уровни доступа для различных пользователей. Также в любой момент вы можете создать собственные роли. 
<br/>Собственный язык шаблонов Вам не придётся изучать ни один язык программирования, чтобы изменить дизайн блога. Теги шаблонов MT просты, как и обычный HTML. 
<br/>Фиды активности В MT можно отслеживать практически любые события с помощью фидов. Это могут быть последние записи, комментарии, активность в системе и другая полезная информация. 
<br/>Надёжная защита от спама В Movable Type уже есть современные средства для защиты от спама, что повзолит вам не беспокоиться об этой проблеме. 
<br/>Категории, подкатегории, теги Упорядочте контент так, как удобно именно вам. Теги могут быть добавлены не только к записям, но и к любым медиа объектам. А при поиске по тегу, посетитель сможет подписаться на новые сообщения, содержащие его. 
<br/>Встроенная библиотека стилей В Movable Type встроен инструмент, который позволяет сменить дизайн в два клика. Библиотека уже содержит более 40 профессионально выполненных дизайнов, список которых постоянно пополняется. 
<br/>Виджеты Управляйте блоками вашего сайта простым перетаскиванием элементов в панели управления.

<br/> 
<br/>Что можно сделать на MTПерсональный блог Коллективный блог Новостной сайт Медиа-ресурс Фотогалерею (необходим плагин) Сборник статей Информационный справочник Это не полный список сайтов, которые можно создать, используя Movable Type. Хотя MT и разрабатывается как платформа для блогинга, движок очень гибок и позволяет управлять различным контентом, используя встроенные средства. 
<br/>Кроме того, это мультиблоговый движок, а значит — на одной инсталляции может работать и блог, и фотогаллерея, и сборник статей, и ещё что-нибудь. 
<br/>Полезные ссылкиБлог MT.ru — новости, советы, хаки, руководства. Русскоязычный форум — поддержка пользователей. Группа в Google для обсуждений.</p>

 summary : <p>Easy tool for resizing an image or group of images at once. </p>

<p>This is a little console application. The aim of the program is to be useful and easy at simple tasks such as shrinking a image in order to keep it fit (or to reduce amount of disk space). </p>

<p>The application can operate with one simple image as well as with a directory containing several images. </p>

<p>In the near future I&#39;m going to build a GUI for this tool.</p>

 title : The polarrose-jmx-rest-bridge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JMX/REST BridgeSimple Java Web Application that exposes JMX servers through HTTP. This was written so that external tools can easily query JMX attributes of Java applications. More specifically, this was written to allow Cacti to generate fancy graphs of ActiveMQ instances. </p>

<p>Right now this web application exposes just one controller /retrieveAttribute that takes a service, object and attribute parameter. These are equivalent to JMXServiceURL, ObjectName and AttributeName in the JMX world. </p>

<p>The plan is to extend this web app to support a real REST like interface to make it easy to query whole sets of attributes or objects as a whole. That will come later. </p>

<p>Example: Querying a remote JVMYou can call it like this to retrieve the VmName attribute of the java.lang:type=Runtime object running on a remote machine: </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080/retrieveAttribute
<br/>   ?service=service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.0.3.1:1099/jmxrmi
<br/>   &amp;object=java.lang:type=Runtime
<br/>   &amp;attribute=VmNameWhich will return a simple text/plain response containing just the attribute value. In this case something like Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM. </p>

<p>Example: Querying the number of items in an ActiveMQ QueueThe following requests returns the number of messages in the queue named MyQueue on the broker named MyBroker. </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080/retrieveAttribute
<br/>   ?service=service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.10.10.10:1099/jmxrmi
<br/>   &amp;object=org.apache.activemq:Type=Queue,Destination=MyQueue,BrokerName=MyBroker

 title : The rest-fixture Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The RestFixture is a FitNesse fixture that allows developers and/or product owners to write test fixtures for REST API with simplicity in mind. The idea is to write tests that are self documenting and easy to write and read, without the need to write Java code. </p>

<p>The fixture allows test writers to express tests as actions (any of the allowed HTTP methods) to operate on resource URIs and express expectations on the content of the return code, headers and body. All without writing one single line of Java code. </p>

<p>And it also works as a living documentation of the API. </p>

This library also manages user&#39;s roster information. For furhter versions message message threads and logs support is planned.  This library differs from other php jabber libraries because every stanza request and response is a different class object. This makes extending current library very easy by adding new classes.</p>

 title : The objectivepq Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project started as a bit of fun to write a decent database admin tool for PostgreSQL (mainly to lean Objective-C) and after some exploration, a proper wrapper needed to be built to cater for the wealth of methods in libPQ. </p>

 title : The ocpgdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ocpgdb is a Python DB-API 2 (aka pep-0249) adapter for PostgreSQL. The code is simple, modular and extensible, with most of the intelligence implemented in Python with only a small C wrapper around libpq. The module is used in several production systems, and while there is little documentation at this stage, most things work as described in pep-0249.  </p>

<p>Unlike most Python PG adapters, this module uses the newer binary PG protocol 3 - in many cases this protocol is faster and safer, although the protocol is less forgiving of implicit type-casting. As an example, other adapters will accept: </p>

<p>curs.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah &gt; %s&#39;, &#39;2006-1-1&#39;)whereas protocol 3 requires: </p>

<p>curs.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah &gt; %s&#39;, datetime.datetime(2006,1,1))or an explicit cast: </p>

<p>curs.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bah &gt; %s::timestamp&#39;, &#39;2006-1-1&#39;)The module requires Python 2.3 or newer, and PostgreSQL 8.1 or newer. If mx.DateTime is available, use_mx_datetime=True can be passed to the connect() function to enable support. To install, unpack the tar file, and as root run: </p>

 summary : <p>PostgreSQL UUID Extension </p>

<p>Stefan Arentz, 2007-07-28 </p>

<p>This module implements a UUID extension for PostgreSQL 8.x. It has been tested on PostgreSQL 8.2.x on OS X 10.4 and Ubuntu 6.06/LTS. </p>

<p>AdvantagesDatabase Size - Using a native UUID type on a table that also has an index on the uuid column saves 47% space. This is good because there is less data on disk and in memory. Which really matters if you have potentially hundred of millions of records. The native UUID type uses 16 bytes of storage whereas a ascii uuid column uses 38 bytes. </p>

<p>Consistency - The native UUID type only accepts UUIDs that are well formatted. Of course you can also do this with a constraint check, but having a native type with a fixed format is more elegant in my opinion. </p>

<p>Transparent - Nobody is going to notice the difference. Because of the implicit typecasting you can use UUIDs as if they are ascii values. </p>

<p>InstallingInstallation is done like this: </p>

<p> % svn co http://polarrose-postgresql-uuid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk polarrose-postgresql-uuid
<br/> % cd polarrose-postgresql-uuid
<br/> % sudo make installActivation like this: </p>

<p> % createdb mydatabase
<br/> % psql mydatabase -f uuid.sqlUsingYou can then use the &#39;uuid&#39; type like this: </p>

<p> create table foo (
<br/>   id uuid not null
<br/> );And generate uuids through the uuid() function. </p>

<p> insert into foo (id) values (uuid());Cast operators have been provided so that the uuid type can be parsed to and from it&#39;s textual representation: </p>

<p> insert into foo (id) values (&#39;36db183f-b1a1-4237-aea4-bc95b5a3bfd8&#39;);And the other way around: </p>

<p> select id::text from foo;Enjoy.</p>

 title : The postgres-kit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The PostgresKit set of frameworks is &quot;yet another&quot; way to interface your Objective-C applications (Cocoa- or Foundation- based) to the wildly popular and extraordinary PostgreSQL database. </p>

<p>This project compiles to two frameworks and some example applications: </p>

<p>PostgresServerKit provides an emdedded PostgreSQL database which runs locally. You can start and stop the database programatically, edit access control and perform data backups of the database. PostgresClientKit provides an embedded client library, which is simply an interface to the normal postgres &quot;libpq&quot; library. Most of the in-build postgres types and mechanisms are supported, especially the &quot;bytea&quot; (binary large objects) type. in development - no bindings yet, some data types TBD PostgresDataKit provides sets of classes for persistent object storage and retrieval (similar to ActiveRecord or CoreData I guess). in development PostgresPrefPane is an example Preference Pane with embedded PostgreSQL server. It includes facilities for installing the server, access control and data backup. EmbeddedServer is an example console-like Cocoa application which embeds a server within an application. It works a but like psql, but in a GUI window, and has data backup integrated, for testing purposes. These binaries compile to Intel 64-bit for Snow Lepoard, so you will need 10.6 and XCode 3.2. </p>

<p>This project is currently in alpha development state, which means that features are still being added </p>

<p>Summary of basic usage1. dbDriver(drv, ...) instantiates the driver object. Eg.  </p>

<p>drv 2.dbConnect(drv,...) creates and opens a connection to the database implemented by the driver drv. Connection string should be specified with parameters like user, password, dbname, host, port, tty and options. For more details refer to the documentation. Eg. </p>

<p>con 3.dbListConnection(drv, ...) provides List of connections handled by the driver Eg. </p>

<p>dbListConnections(drv)4.dbGetInfo(dbObject, ...) and summary(dbObject) returns information about the dbObject (driver, connection or resultSet).  Eg. </p>

<p>dbGetInfo(drv)
<br/>summary(con)5.dbSendQuery(con, statement, ...) submits one statement to the database.  Eg.  </p>

<p>rs 6.fetch(rs,n, ...) fetches the next n elements from the result set.  Eg.  </p>

<p>fetch(rs,n=-1) ## return all elements
<br/>fetch(rs,n=2) ##returns last 2 elements in record set.7. dbGetQuery(con,statement, ...) submits, execute, and extract output in one operation. Eg. </p>

<p>dbGetQuery(con,&quot;select * from TableName&quot;)8. dbGetException(con, ...) returns the status of the last DBMS statement sent over the connection.  Eg.  </p>

<p>dbGetException(con)9. dbListResults(con, ...) returns the resultsets active on the given connection. Please note that the current RPostgreSQL package can handle only one resultset per connection (which may change in the future). Eg.  </p>

<p>dbListResults(con)10. dbListTables(con, ...) returns the list of tables available on the connection.  Eg.  </p>

<p>dbListTables(con)11. dbExistsTable(con, TableName, ...) checks whether a particular table exists on the given connection. Returns a logical. Eg.  </p>

<p>Description for technicians:This project is the combination of J2EE staff (spring, hibernate etc) with google web tools as GUI. It&#39;s intention is to provide base for building business automation projects. It&#39;s main goal to let business application developers to concentrate on business logic, without spending much time for technologies integration and technical issues. For those who are familiar with Appfuse.org, this project can be considered as appfuse with GWT as GUI. The format of project can be described as &quot;kick start j2ee application&quot;. It means it works out of box. You may deploy it, start it and then extend it with your functionality. </p>

<p>Description for managers:The goal of this project is to provide a base for business application web-development. The project itself is the integration of cutting edge J2EE technologies with GWT - the toolset from Google, which allows building rich user interface (AJAX-based) directly in web-browser. This project tries to be as small as possible. It does not try to invent wheel, but rather it tries to be required minimum which lets the best things to smoothly work with each other. This project should let developers to focus on business logic and not spend their time for technical issues. This project focuses only on building rich client-server application, it is not suitable for creating web-sites. This project already have been used as a base for rel-life commercial products.

 summary : <p>AjaxGUI is  a &#39;web application framework&#39; to develop ajax applications in Java. It depends on the &#39;javascript gui framework&#39; qooxdoo.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- No Javascript coding, 100% Java
<br/>- No HTML knowledge needed
<br/>- Develop GUIs the same easy way as with Swing, SWT or System.Windows.Forms
<br/>- Behaves like a desktop application (e.g. a modal window stops the current programm
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;flow until the window is closed), not like a web application
<br/>- Includes singleton support
<br/>- Java like layout managers support
<br/>- Runs in &#39;every&#39; servlet container like Tomcat 5.5</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- At the moment there is only one developer (me) active :-)
<br/>- Still in development (no stable API etc.)
<br/>- Needs a lot of testing (and bug fixing?)
<br/>- No GUI designer as eclipse plugin available :-)</p>

 summary : <p>AboutThis project is a proof of concept for runtime and manageable filters  (javax.servlet.filter) and chains within a J2EE servlet container and, more specifically, the GX WebManager Component Framework. </p>

<p>atoom-dynfilter-core </p>

<p>Core package implementing core filter logic for dynamically managed filters. It provides sample manager en resolver implemenations and has no other depedncies that the Servlet API. </p>

<p>atoom-dynfilter-managerwcb </p>

<p>Sample usage of Atoom DynFilter in the GX WebManager Component Framework that delegates management of the dynamic chains to a service component. More information about GX WebManager at http://www.gxdeveloperweb.com. </p>

<p>StatusJust a PoC at the moment... future enhancements: </p>

<p>Replacing dummy implementation of the manager wcb with a real interface for dynamically adding/removing filters Adding a management panel that allows administrators to configure filters and mappings. </p>

<p>ConfigureAdd both atoom-dynfilter-core and atoom-dynfilter-managerwcb to the /WEB-INF/lib of the servlet container. </p>

<p>Configure and map the DynFilterChainFilter? in the web.xml </p>

 summary : <p>Baseliner is a project intended to develop a full server and web application in Perl to manage the release management process of checkout, build and deployment of applications.  </p>

<p>It will cover the lifecycle from the code repository (ie. SVN, CVS, Git, Perforce, Harvest, Clearcase, Team Foundation) to the execution server (ie. Websphere, IIS...).  </p>

<p>It should cover the following technologies and applications: Ant, Nant, make, Maven, CruiseControl, Eclipse, Tomcat, Websphere, Weblogic, Oracle PL/SQL, Notes, and more! </p>

<p>Right now, the Perl modules are not structured enough as to move it to CPAN, so it will me managed here until we have something solid enough to justify polluting the CPAN namespace.  </p>

<p>Most of the functionality published here is being used in production servers in real life corporations. </p>

<p>DescriptionRight now Baseliner only handles creating an Ant build.xml for JAR, WAR and EAR projects, so you can compile it with ant.  </p>

<p>SummaryBest to see how to use it in your perl script. Let&#39;s suppose you know something changed in  </p>

<p>use Baseliner;
<br/>my $EW = Baseliner::Parse::Eclipse::J2EE-&gt;parse( &#39;c:\dir\to\eclipse\workspace&#39; );

<p>$buildxml-&gt;save( &#39;mybuild.xml&#39;);  ## save the file </p>

<p>print Baseliner::Build::Ant::build(xml=&gt; $buildxml-&gt;data(), print=&gt;0 );  ## run ant
<br/>Or you can run Ant by yourself: </p>

<p>ant -f mybuild.xml clean build packageThe code has been divided in 3 blocks.  </p>

<p>DependenciesTo run the parse you&#39;re going to need: </p>

 title : The Java EE Cache Filter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Java EE Cache Filter provides a collection of common Servlet filters for Java web applications allowing you to transparently set HTTP cache headers in order to enable browser caching.</p>

<p>Why does cache matter?</p>

<p>Web page designs are getting richer and richer, which means more scripts, stylesheets, images, and Flash in the page. A first-time visitor to your page may have to make several HTTP requests, but by using the Expires header you make those components cacheable. This avoids unnecessary HTTP requests on subsequent page views.
<br/>Browsers (and proxies) use a cache to reduce the number and size of HTTP requests, making web pages load faster.</p>

 title : The cokemi-utils-mvc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A very lightweight and useful utility for J2EE MVC coding;There are some useful classes in the utility.1, A TemplateDAO based on Commons.dbutils or Spring JdbcTemplate;sample code: </p>

<p>DataSource ds = new TestDataSource();
<br/>QueryRunnerAdapter queryRunner = new QueryRunnerAdapter(ds);
<br/>JdbcTemplateAdapter jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplateAdapter(ds);
<br/>TemplateDAO dao = new TemplateDAO(queryRunner);
<br/>// for JdbcTemplate, like this:
<br/>// dao = new TemplateDAO(jdbcTemplate); / dao.setJdbcAdapter(jdbcTemplate);
<br/>SampleBean bean = (SampleBean)dao.queryForBean(SampleBean.class,&quot;id=1&quot;);
<br/>List list = dao.queryForBeanList(SampleBean.class);
<br/>// do update for bean 
<br/>// dao.updateForBean() / dao.insertForBean() / dao.deleteForBean() 	Of course, you can implement another JdbcAdapter for the TemplateDAO. </p>

<p>2,  Fill the value of properties of the POJO bean；sample code: </p>

<p>SampleBean dest = new SampleBean()
<br/>Object src = ....;
<br/>ModelValueUtils.setValues(dest, src);Actually, this class is an extension from the commons.beanutils; The type of the source object can be Map / ResultSet / HttpServletRequest / String(in &quot;key=value&quot; format), or an another JavaBean; You can also set alias name for every property of the dest bean. Therefore, the value of properties in the source object can be flexibly bound into the dest bean; 3, Generate the common sql from the POJO bean;sample code: </p>

<p>SampleBean dest = new SampleBean()
<br/>Object src = ....;
<br/>ModelValueUtils.setValues(dest, src);
<br/>String sql = ModelToSQLUtils.generateInsertSql(dest);
<br/>// .....other sql generating;However, it&#39;s just for the simple sql generating. And, you should set some DB signatures for the bean by using Annotation, such as tableName/keyFieldName/...etc </p>

<p>4, A mini TemplateAction and ActionDispatcher;Struts is pretty good, but i just don&#39;t like the XML config, so... </p>

 title : The commons-filters Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Commons Filters - SiteThe Commons Filters site is located at http://ludovic.bert.free.fr/projects/commons-filters. </p>

<p>PresentationCommons filters is a suite of commonly used servlets filters which may be usefull for your web applications (such as PdfFilter, GZipFilter, XsltFilter, LogFilter, HttpHeaderFilter, ...). </p>

<p>LogFilter: The log filter is a servlet filter used to log client requests, it is usefull for debugging purpose. XsltFilter: The XSLT filter is a servlet filter used to perform an XSLT transformation. It is usefull to generate dynamic presentation. PdfFilter: The PDF filter is a servlet filter used to perform an XSL-FO transformation. It is usefull to generate inline PDF. GZipFilter: The GZIP filter is a servlet filter which looks in the HTTP headers if the client support the GZIP format, in this case the servlet filter compress the HTTP response. It is usefull for performance optimizations. HttpHeaderFilter: The HTTP header filter is a servlet filter which is able to set and/or change HTTP responses header values. A typical usage is for performance optimizations.</p>

 title : The custom-keymatch-onebox Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This OneBox module mimics the Google Search Appliance&#39;s built-in KeyMatch functionality.  By using this instead of the built-in KeyMatch  feature, you can customize the Java Servlet implementation to provide alternative behavior that better suites your needs. </p>

<p>See the README link on the right for more details.  The latest source is available through the Source tab or the Download link on the right.  Key matches are available through the Source tab, contact Michah to receive key matches for your data set.  Matches can be weighted or weightless. </p>

<p>The code also handles probability scores as weighted keymatches.  Simple precede a key match with #0.dddd (or #1.0) to assign a probability  to the key match.  Multiple scores are efficiently aggregated by this matcher. </p>

<p>For detailed performance and implementation information, see keymatcher. </p>

<p>Dowry is based on the idea that the server-side already knows all sorts of useful metadata.  It knows the structure of our entities, what their datatypes are, what is required, how long values can be, etc.  These is likely some canonical representation of this metadata within the application (for instance, a Hibernate mapping).  Dowry was designed to reuse this information that already exists on the server-side, to make Ajax coding simpler.</p>

 summary : <p>Web applications can access the local file system through this resource connector. The datasource is configured with a directory that acts as a &quot;chroot&quot; for the web app. FSFile objects mimic java.io.File objects so they should seem familiar and be comfortable to use. Transactions are not supported yet. Local Transaction and XA Transaction support will be added as soon as possible (which might take awhile, sorry). </p>

<p>File system Inflow (scan directories for new files) is not supported yet. This functionality will probably be the 2.0 release. </p>

<p>Random access files have also been considered. This is not a big priority so it might be a 3.0 release, we&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>

 summary : <p>This project help building GWT application with complex UI based on descriptive XML file. </p>

<p>All work is done during compile-time using GWT Generators. </p>

<p>Some features that is currently implemented: </p>

<p>Fully descriptive XML-driven user inteface building. Easy access to generated objects. Simple state changing (just one call of method) &quot;Lazy&quot; widget creation: widgets are created only when it becomes visible State inheritance: any state can have parent state. So you can write some general state with basic UI, and then derive some state with only changes. In-line visual attributes of containers (like &quot;align=&#39;right&#39; width=&#39;100%&#39; style=&#39;bar&#39;&quot;) State-aware widgets: If widget implements UIStateListener interface and added to UI, it will be notified about state change.  Here is example of XML file for gwt-ui: </p>

 title : The hibernate-generic-dao Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hibernate Generic D.A.O. FrameworkThe motivation behind the frameworkWe had worked on a project where we hand-coded all of our DAOs. This produced four irksome difficulties: (1) Method names and implementations were not altogether consistent. (2) It was a pain to make additional columns sortable or filterable, and as a result, a lot of pages lacked good sorting and filtering. (3) Making additional DAOs was tedious and took a fair amount of time. (4) Writing tests for DAOs is tricky and tedious, so no one really did.  </p>

<p>This framework aims to ease our troubles. </p>

<p>Why might you consider looking into this framework?Generic DAO:  With the sweetness of Java generics, the concept of generic DAOs is not new, and it’s not difficult. However, we’ve put a lot of work into making these easy to use an</p>

 title : The hpcwl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the source code for a website I created for a non-profit program aimed at helping the homeless in a practical, safe, and meaningful way. In 2007, the project was run in 4 cities (including New York and Chicago), had national media coverage, and helped collect 1700 gifts from 450 donors that were distributed to almost 1000 homeless individuals. In 2008, the number of participating cities is already set to double, with BIG plans to grow further in the future. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have VERY limited time to work on it anymore, and am actively looking for volunteers to help improve and support the website. It is built with Java/J2EE/GWT, has a MySQL backend, hosted on Linux with a tomcat server. If that sounds like something you&#39;d like to get involved in, please do! There is lots of room to do cool and interesting things with it still (could even use a rewrite if starting fresh appeals to you). </p>

 title : The jarq Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to JArq, a J2EE software development frameworkInitially, this site will provide you all the English documentation, but you can visit our Spanish site just pointing your browser to http://jarq-req-tool.appspot.com  </p>

<p>This projects will try to give you an entire scaffold for your web applications, but, it will not try to avoid the code development, just reduce it to only the necessary. This project is the evolution of many years of professional development and the generalization of the most commons problems is every applications and some more sophisticated that have been found interesting through all the projects were JArq was incubated. </p>

<p>Some of the features of JArq are the following ones: </p>

<p>AutenticationEvery petition that was made to the server will be intercep by our controller and check for a valid user. A configurable page is allow of course, but as many other autentication frameworks doesn´t have, just can add to the session objet as many information an objects you want. JArq will handle this objects automatically. </p>

<p>AutorisationEvery facade´s method can be autorized throw a simple configuration file (we are working on annotation feature that will be ready soon). JArq will check in every execution if the user logged is autorized to do this bussines operation. </p>

<p>Automatically listingFor every Hibernate entity that implements a simple interface, you can automatically list it with a paginated list in our DisplayTag only with a little configuration in the IoC container. </p>

<p>Automatically updates/creates/deletesLike the paginated lists, for every update, create or delete page you need you can implement them all in one just with a XML definition in the IoC. </p>

<p>JASON RPC callsJArq provides a easy interface to do AJAX calls through Jasorb project, only with a simple configuracion of a bridge an defining the method you want to publish for every facade. </p>

<p>Compile and packageThe simple the best. In the initial zip of the application you will find an Ant script to deploy you entire app if you follow the initial schema of directories. We don´t want to complicate it so much so its very easy the IDE configuration, of course, you can integrate it easily with Maven of your own Ant scripts by your own. </p>

<p>Excel moduleNowadays so many applications needs to generate Excels reports or just put in a workbook some information. The problem is that this task gets complicated when you have to introduce formulas and complicated date. This JArq module mades you life easy, as automatically recalculates formulas if some other data moves, and works easy with regions. That´s will make the maintain of the code so much easy and clear. </p>

<p>ConfigurationJArq underlying configuration is handle by commons-configuration. But we will provide you a cached configuration from properties and a database table (with have preference to fetch properties) and a JMX bean to control the load of propeties on the fly. All prepared to large load of petitions and clusters configurations. </p>

<p>Memcache AdviceThis component could be used standalone, as it doesn&#39;t have any dependecies with the Core. This aspect allows you to increase the performance of your application using the memcache daemon transparently. Just configure the package, or classes you want to be cached (should be at DAO level) and the advice will use an existing daemon of Memcache to store it and intercept it. </p>

<p>JArq doesn´t try to reinvent the wheel. It´s just a tier over Spring, Hibernate, commons, and some other Open Source projects. But it doesn&#39;t close any functionality, so you just use it, and if you don´t like some feature, just implement it by your own or ignore it!</p>

 title : The jsserv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JsServ contains a set of spring components that allow running the scripts in a website on the server side in case a user has no support for JavaScript or has disabled it. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The DOMInterceptor intercepts the HTML output of other controller and initializes a dom state with it. The document itself is parsed into a DOM tree and the referenced scripts are loaded and executed. Additional patch scripts can be defined to alter the behaviour of other scripts. </p>

<p>The current version adds  </p>

<p>... 
<br/>Links around every element for which a onclick handler is registered. The links point to a DOMEvent Controller that triggers updates in the user&#39;s DOM State. </p>

<p>A little example scripts implements a collapsable tree that changes the style classes of nested unordered lists. With the JsServ DOM Manipulation this works with JavaScript as well as without JavaScript on the client side. </p>

<p>While this code is only a rough sketch it promises a lot in terms of vastly reducing the amount of work for sites that must use JavaScript to get an optimal user experience but who cannot or want not to have a java-script only site. Although the link-as-click event method is rather limited, it is good enough to make a lot of DOM manipulations possible. Expressed only once in JavaScript. Running in it&#39;s deluxe form for people with client-side JavaScript and in a basic form for people with the help of using server-side JavaScript. All is seamlessly integratable into all kinds of Controllers.  </p>

<p>HowToGetStarted</p>
 title : The jtilecache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is now called GeoWebCache, and has moved to http://geowebcache.org.Using GeoServer to serve geographic image tiles directly to a web client (such as OpenLayers) requires substantial computational effort on the server side. Yet, the redundant and largely static nature of the problem makes it an ideal candidate for a cache. Existing naive HTTP caches are often employed, but are not well tailored to the specific needs of WMS image tile requests. One existing WMS-C (Web Mapping Service Caching server) exists: MetaCarta&#39;s TileCache. TileCache provides a significant performance improvement for serving map tiles. However, TileCache is typically run using mod_python, an environment that requires much considerable setup in addition to a J2EE deployment of GeoServer. In response to these needs, JTileCache will implement a WMS-C server modeled after TileCache, but written in pure Java. JTileCache will be deployed as standalone web application, allowing it to cache local or remote GeoServer instances. By relying on existing distributed cache frameworks, JTileCache would ease the deployment of multiple caching servers (useful to increase the number of concurrent browser connections), and allow the cache to exist in local memory, on disk, in a database, or distributed across the network. </p>

<p>( My work on this project is sponsored by Google Summer of Code in affliation with the GeoServer project. )</p>

 title : The kaigou-online Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Your task is to continue with the development of an online meeting scheduler system. This has been running for the last two years. Last year, the groups ported the J2EE 1.4 version of the prototype to Java EE 5. The customer has selected a prototype system from one of last year&#39;s two groups for continued development by your group. </p>

<p>Borth University requires a system that will allow its staff to manage meetings. Meeting venues are lecture theatres, and other meeting rooms, depending on what is required: e.g. a large conference or a small department meeting. Many of these venues are managed centrally by university timetabling staff. Other venues are managed by specific departments allowing members of the department to book those venues. </p>

<p>Such a system needs to deal with both short meetings and conferences spanning several days. </p>

<p>The system should also support the initiation of meeting participants to a potential meeting asking for potential participant date and time constraints: e.g dates they cannot attend. The goal here is for the system to ascertain the optimal date and venue for the meeting so that the majority of potential participants can attend. Active participants must also be asked about other special equipment requirements on meeting venue. </p>

<p>Integration with a participant calendar/diary desktop tool is important so that the participants can be kept up-to-date with the meetings they wish to participate in, their venues and their dates/times, and especially if this information changes dynamically. Separate, web access to functionality is also required since an end user is not always able to access her desktop/laptop calendar tool. </p>

<p>Detailed functional and non-functional requirements will be expressed using XP stories and acceptance tests. These will initially be tentative and will be refined during the course of the project. </p>

<p>There are two major non-functional requirements. First, XP, or agreed adaptations, must be used as the development methodology. Second, the programming language must be Java, using the J2SE and Java EE 5 platforms.</p>

<p>The code migration path is available in several step-by-step projects. Starting with the initial setup, upto the fully migrated version to Spring and Hibernate. </p>

<p>The project used is the 1.0.5 version of the J2EE Adventure Builder, which we will convert to Spring using the Spring Framework. For all the other components we will use as much of Spring (and related projects) as possible. </p>

<p> The architecture is described here. It describes the highlevel architecture of the Adventure Builder project. For this migration we are going to focus on the web application and Order Processing System, those are the 2 systems we have control over. The other 4 systems are external systems which are  exposed as a web service.  </p>

<p>SituationFor the migration we are going to pretend that we are the development team responsible for building the Adventure Builder web application and Order Processing system, those 2 systems are own in house build applications. For this migration we have a few things that we have to bare in mind: </p>

<p>lightweight architecture preferably no EJB&#39;s use of standard frameworks (deprecate/remove WAF) runtime restricted to JDK 1.4, tests can be written with JDK 1.5 </p>

<p>VersionsThe actual project version is 1.0.5. For this endavour the version is increased to 1.0.6. In different steps we will try to reach our final 1.0.6 version. </p>

 summary : <p>The Sun Petstore Reference Application began as a way to demonstrate design patterns to Java developers. Over the years, the Petstore application has been recoded for a variety of frameworks, toolkits, and platforms, including Apple&#39;s Web Objects, Macromedia&#39;s Flash and Cold Fusion, Microsoft&#39;s ASP.NET, and Google Web ToolKit. Today, there are at least twenty Petstore implementations, and probably many more. </p>

<p>Petstore from Square One site features a standard set of requirements and use cases for the Petstore application. The purpose of the site is to help contrast and compare the various Petstore implementations, and to host new and improved versions Petstore, so as to help developers learn from one another. </p>

 title : The struts2ajaxpartstaglibplugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The AjaxParts Taglib (APT) is a component of the Java Web Parts (JWP) project (http://javawebparts.sourceforge.net) that allows for 100% declarative (read: no Javascript coding required!) AJAX functionality within a Java-based webapp.  It is especially a great solution for situations where you have an existing application that you need to add some AJAX to (but it&#39;s very good for new development too of course!) </p>

<p>This project is a plugin for Struts2 that allows quick and easy usage of APT with Struts2 in a typical plugin form. </p>

<p>To use it, simply drop this JAR into your Struts2 project and create an ajax-config.xml file (as detailed in the readme.html file container within the JAR). Then, add the single needed context parameter entry to web.xml pointing to your config file and you are ready to rock and roll. </p>

<p>You can also find a very simple Struts2 example app here to show you all of this in action.  In general though, that readme file should contain all the details you need.</p>

It is licensed as free, open-source software under the Apache 2.0 license agreement. It has been tested to run on GlassFish V2, and it is being used currently by GrapevineIM. It is built on top of the Smack XMPP API from Jive Software. </p>

<p>BinariesYou can download the binaries below, but I highly recommend that you read the installation instructions first. You will need to change the USERNAME/PASSWORD fields in the &#39;sun-ejb-jar.xml&#39; file for the inbound message-driven bean used as part of the test app (.ear file). You&#39;ll also need to configure other things on your GlassFish server (like message queues and JNDI names). </p>

 title : The xsiterevolution Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A ideia do projeto é apenas treinar, e aplicar o uso de J2EE e possivelmente de outras tecnologias que serão adcionadas no projeto ao longo do tempo. </p>

<p>A ideia do projeto, é criar um banco de dados de obras culturais, ou algo assim. É permitido o upload de qualquer tipo de obra cultural, sendo que este arquivo será armazenado em um banco de dados. E a ideia é que sejam arquivos pequenos, de fácil acesso, como clipes, fotos, pinturas, livros, musicas e etc. Então a ideia não é criar um site de relacionamento, nem de compartilhamento, pois já existem vários, e não vale a pena perder tempo com isso. A ideia é criar um banco de dados. </p>

<p>O projeto tende a ser bem livre, podendo ser criado módulos a vontade, porém é importante se ater a ideia central do projeto. </p>

 title : The common-script-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CSE (Common Script Engine) is a program language with variety of functions, which is easy to learn and use. On the basis of a group of highly abstract data structure, CSE is simple but effective Object-Oriented program language. CSE combines the script language and compiled language in one. In this way, it obtains the advantages of the two. Users can find that it has the flexibility of dynamic language, and high effectiveness of compiled code.  </p>

<p>CSE language serves throughout the whole procedure of product research and development. In the early stage of product research and development, CSE works as a rapid prototyping language. In the middle stage, CSE support rapid development and debug in the script form. In the later stage, script module can be packaged and compiled to executive code and support market release in binary form.  </p>

<p>CSE is a highly abstract language system, whose script feature is similar to Python. It is fast in application development thanks to its elegant syntax, dynamic data type and interpretive execution. CSE is highly flexible and can realize mapping among all kinds of program language (including C/C++, Delphi, JAVA, Python etc.) under simple rules. CSE can be easily built in all kinds of program language. And other language module can be built in the separate CSE application system as well.  </p>

<p>CSE（Common Script Engine）是一种易学易用、功能强大的编程语言，她基于一组高度抽象的数据结构，简单并不失高效的实现面向对象编程。CSE将脚本语言与编译语言揉为一体，兼具两者各自优点，用户既享受脚本化动态语言的灵活性，也同时拥有编译代码的执行高效率。 </p>

<p>CSE语言服务于产品研发全过程，在产品研发前期，CSE作为快速原型语言，产品中期，CSE以脚本形态支持快速开发与调测，在产品后期，脚本模块可打包编译成执行代码，以二进制形态支持市场发布。 </p>

<p>CSE是一种高度抽象的语言系统，其脚本特性可与Python相比拟，优雅的语法、动态数据类型、解释执行等，具备快速应用开发的各种特点。CSE还具有强烈的可伸缩特性，以简单的规则在各类编程语言（包括C/C++、Delphi、JAVA、Python等）实现映射，很容易将CSE系统内嵌于各种编程环境，同时，也可同样方便的将其它语言模块嵌入到独立的CSE应用体系中。</p>

 summary : <p>What is Force.com for Google App Engine? </p>

<p>Force.com for Google App Engine is a Python library and test harness that lets you access the Force.com Web services API from within Google App Engine applications. Once it is installed in your Google App Engine application, that application can start to seamless make callouts to the Force.com Web services API. This API lets you query and manipulate data in your Force.com environment - effectively letting you tap into the Force.com platform from within the application. </p>

<p>Currently, the toolkit supports many of the key Force.com Web Services APIs, allowing Google App Engine developers to create apps with direct access access to powerful Force.com functions. Some of the methods covered by the toolkit include Create , Update, Query, describeGlobal, and more. </p>

<p>For example, the following piece of Python code shows how easy it is to create a new Account record on Force.com from within an App Engine application: </p>

<p>sobjects = [] 
<br/>new_acc = { &#39;type&#39;: &#39;Account&#39;, &#39;name&#39; : &#39;My New Account&#39; } 
<br/>sobjects.append(new_acc) 
<br/>results = client.create(sobjects)To get started, simply install the toolkit and then check out the User Guide (see Links)</p>

<p>So let me elaborate: Lets say i release a very simple Space Invaders clone but you hate the graphics, well with this engine you can snap in a new module with better graphics, or sound, or level designs. You can also snap in extra graphics that let you add powerups or extra moves, converting Space Invaders to Galaga, then add to Galaga changing it into R-Type and beyond. </p>

<p>All ideas, discussions and questions are welcome.</p>

 title : The typist Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Typist began as a prototype and mental exercise that is inspired by the template engines from in MT and TypePad.</p>

<p>I spend most of my development time working with Movable Type and to a lessor extent. The vast majority of my Perl code is for Movable Type and when its not its creating an open source module for CPAN that works like something in MT.</p>

<p>When I do have to develop something outside of Movable Type I reach for CGI::Application and Data::ObjectDriver which are quite similar to what MT provides. The one thing I miss the though is MT&#39;s template engine.</p>

<p>Even MT&#39;s application screen are generated using HTML::Template. HTML::Template is fast, lightweight and separates logic and layout. The problem is the separation of logic from layout is done to the point where templates are almost brain dead. Almost everything but the most basic logic must be done before processing a template in the application code. Want to list 5 instead of 10 items here? You have to go back to your coder. Want to change the sort order. Back to your code. Want to pre-select a pulldown menu item? Each option needs to be wrapped in an TMPL_IF statement. To me this makes development tedious and difficult. It also makes reuse of template layouts difficult if not impossible.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at other Perl template engines too. My problem with template engines such as Mason and Template Toolkit is that it requires the template designer to know Perl or something similar to it. It also makes writing crap code (a technical term) too easy. (Broaden the scope a moment PHP suffers from this same issues.)</p>

<p>To me the MT style of template engine is a great balance of flexibility, power and ease of use. It keeps application logic and layout neatly separated and can be (and has been) used by many coding neophytes without knowing a line of Perl code. With a bit of Perl code it can be extended using easy to re-distribute plugins. The whole implementation of a tag used throughout many templates can be easily swapped out and a template developer wouldn&#39;t even know it.</p>

<p>Granted I&#39;m biased by my background, but I think this style of template engine provides and an option that is currently missing from Perl programmer&#39;s toolkit.</p>

 summary : <p>Vivvo Template Engine is a light-weight yet powerful template engine written in PHP and completely PREG based. The system is currently v0.9, beta release.</p>

<p>It consists of only one highly-optimized object-oriented class, using basic, widely used tags like {if}, {foreach}, {literal}, {include}, {variable}. Its power comes from full support for objects, method calls, arrays and recursive templates.</p>

<p>Example usage: Basic template (index.tpl) using recursive inclusion of list.tpl template.</p>

 summary : <p>backuptab is a bash script that parses fstab to find file systems on a Linux machine and then attempts to intelligently backup those partitions.  If the partition is identified as a logical volume it uses LVM tools to create a snapshot of the volume for backup.  If the partition is identified as containing a guest machine (VMWare Server), it uses VMWare tools to suspend the guest machine while the snapshot, or dump, is created. </p>

<p>Backup can be done to a local disk (file) or over the network using pre-shared keys and ssh. </p>

 title : The bisturi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>El Kit permite realizar instalaciones de linux sobre dispositivos de bajo perfil pudiendo utilizar hardware reducido o equipos obsoletos (arquitectura x86). </p>

<p>Este proyecto se inicio en el 2002 por el Servicio de Informatica de la Universitat Jaume I con el objetivo de generar una herramienta tanto para uso interno como para uso de la comunidad Open Source. </p>

<p>El equipo de personas que participo en su diseño y programacion, estaba formado por personal del servicio de informatica: Juan Padilla (jtpadilla@gmail.com) y David Rubert (david.rubert@gmail.com). Ademas se contrato durante varios meses (945 horas) a Antonio Perez (aperez@aditel.org) como personal externo para realizar los trabajos de programacion. </p>

<p>Esta herramienta estaba diseñada para los siguientes usos: </p>

<p>Permitir el reciclado de equipamiento informatico en desuso, convirtiendo PC no aptos para su uso en aulas y en la administracion, en thin client para su utilizacion como terminales de red (terminal server o telnet), kioscos, etc. Generar equipos para el control de instalaciones, como sistemas incrustados sobre hardware especializado (en su momento se utilizaron PCs en formato industrial). Cualquier imagen bootable en CD o lapiz USB a medida para cualquier otra cosa que se nos pueda ocurrir (terminal videoconferencia, puesto remoto de trabajo, terminal educativo, material para asignaturas, sistemas multimedia, etc). El proyecto quedo practicamente terminado siendo capaz de generar todos los imagenes que nos propusimos y quedaba pendiente generar la documentacion para el desarrollador, hacerlo disponible en la Web y lanzar su correspondiente anuncio. </p>

<p>Debido desgraciadamente a la saturacion de trabajo del servicio y al establecimiento de nuevas prioridades en el area relacionada, el proyecto fue cancelado. </p>

<p>Recientemente, despues de pedir permiso a la direccion del servicio, hemos decidido publicar el proyecto en un repositorio publico para favorecer la posibilidad de que sea continuado con la ayuda de otras personas; parte del equipo original esta disponible para continuar con el proyecto. </p>

<p>En el documento Intro, hay una breve explicacion de los diversos aspectos del kit de desarrollo.   </p>

<p>Una vez leidos los documentos anteriores, incluidos todos aquellos que aparecen enlazados en sus niveles inferiores podemos pasar al estudio de las distintas Estrategias que se han previsto tanto en lo referente a la composicion de la imagen del target como al proceso diseñado para el boot del target y su configuracion. </p>

<p>En el documento ModificacionesNecesarias, se indican cuales son los cambios necesarios para actualizar el proyecto, ya que debido a algunas decisiones de diseño, era demasiado dependiente del sistema host sobre el cual se instalaba. </p>

<p>Si tienes interes en colaborar, no dudes en contactar conmigo (jtpadilla@gmail.com) , aunque deberias leer toda la documentacion relacionada con el proyecto para tener una completa vision sobre el estado del proyecto y sobre cuales son los tipos de conocimientos necesarios para participar.</p>

 summary : <p>Cauldron Project </p>

<p>Give that a stir, would ya? </p>

<p>AboutThe Cauldron Project (formally bsd-appliance) is derived from work done at Collaborative Fusion, Inc. with the goal of developing a scalable and manageable enterprise-class BSD-based appliance platform.  Much of the work was originally based on Gray Watson &#39;s  Soekris on OpenBSD Diskless Project . The work was the topic for a paper and associated presentation at  EuroBSDCon 2006 and  NYCBSDCon 2006. </p>

<p>The current framework is ideal for bona-fide network appliances: Routers, Firewalls (Policy Routers), Set Top Boxes, Console Servers, RAS Terminal Concentrators, Wireless Access Points (APs), Load Balancers / Application Switches, IDS Sensors, Network Cameras, Environmental Sensors , as well as other heavyweight appliances NAS Storage, Proxy Servers, E-mail SPAM Filters, DNS Slaves.  </p>

<p>ISVs, Small-Medium size businesses, OEMs, and Individuals alike will also find the system useful for systems such as Set Top Boxes, Point of Sale (POS) Terminals,  </p>

<p>In theory the framework could also be used in embedded applications such as micro-firmware for Printers, Scientific Instruments, Phones and other mobile communications and multimedia devices.  </p>

<p>Supported Platforms:</p>

<p>Vendor  Branch  Status    NetBSD  3  Full   NetBSD  4  Full   OpenBSD  4.4  Testing   FreeBSD  7  Testing   DragonFly    Untested  </p>

<p>Status / News11/09/2008: Chris Maverick provided us with a new logo; playful and whimsical, like the world we live in. 10/15/2008: There&#39;s a great article in BSDMag about loading NetBSD onto the Linksys NSLU2 using the EVBArm port.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not really a practical cauldron application because the OS appears to install directly onto the underlying RAID partition! 10/13/2008: A new snapshot for the Soekris 5501 is available.  Details soon, as well as potential automated daily/weekly builds. 10/11/2008: Preliminary FreeBSD support development has begun  Notes 10/01/2008: Project has been renamed to &#39;Cauldron&#39;; a logo is imminent.  04/25/2007: Revision 81 reflects much of the work accomplished on OpenBSD.  I encourage everyone to check out a snapshot via a VMWare Image I&#39;ve released. 04/20/2007: Revision 78 reflects significan work on issue #1, #3, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9 03/28/2007: I opened &#39;Issue #7&#39;.  I&#39;ll probably start working on it this afternoon.  Sorry for the delay all; I&#39;ve been busy with some regional non-profit work and submitting   and trying to stir up support a Google SoC application. 03/11/2007: Added info on the Axiomtek NA-1041 featured at NYCBSDCon and EuroBSDCon `06 .  Also updated and resampled the images properly on on the ARInfotek Teak3011 03/06/2007: Adding some info about the ARInfotek Teak 3011.  Need to thumbnail the images. 03/05/2007: I&#39;ve added some info about the ARInfotek Teak3011 03/04/2007: I&#39;ve started working on a Tutorial / Walk-Through for using the Framework.  Use revision 48 of trunk/. Old New Archive Project &amp; GoalsThe project is composed of: </p>

<p>A Framework for adapting and optimizing BSD for use on network appliances and embedded environments. Resources (Tools and Docs) for Profiling BSD systems. A centralized location for coordinating development efforts for improving the embedded viability of BSD distributions. A clearinghouse for BSD-compatible appliances and other hardware as well as BSD-friendly OEM vendors Development for a NAND/NOR Flash MTD style file system for BSD (a la, JFFS2) Adaptation of true serial console BIOS solutions for SBCs (a la, ComBIOS (Soekris) or BIOSBoot (Routerboard) ) </p>

 title : The cryptomfs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cryptomfs is a MacFUSE implementation of cryptofs by Christoph Hohmann. </p>

<p>Cryptomfs will use a directory to store encrypted files. The mountpoint will provide access to the unencrypted data, but no data is ever written to the harddisk without encryption. </p>

<p>Update 23 Feb 2010New version available: 1.1.  If you have any previous versions of Cryptomfs installed please move them to the trash before installing. </p>

<p>Changes from version 1.0: </p>

<p>Default mount location is now /mount. Added application preference to terminate application after filesystem has mounted. Added command line utilities mkcryptomfs and mount_cryptomfs.  Symlinks are created in /usr/bin/ during install. Passwords can now be specified on the command line. Note When attempting to mount a Cryptomfs 1.0 filesystem, you will be asked to type a &#39;new&#39; password. You should type the password you used when creating the filesystem. If you make a mistake in the password entry follow the steps on the wiki page FixMistypedPassword.  See RemoveKeychainEntries to clean up any old/mistyped passwords. </p>

<p>RequirementsRequires Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). Must have MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse) installed. FeaturesFilesystems are packages so they behave like disk images in Finder (e.g., Double  clicking on the .cryptofs package will mount the filesystem.) Passwords are entered using a dialog. Keychain support. Custom volume names for mounted filesystems. Custom icon support for mounted filesystems. Easy creation of new filesystems. Filesystem configuration is saved in a plist file. Filesystems can be mounted using cryptofs and fuse in other operating systems.  Good for sharing encrypted data on a dual boot system.</p>
 title : The dhtfs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Most file systems organize files in a directory hierarchy. A file is stored in a particular directory. When it is needed to store a file, a decision has to be made about the most suitable directory for the file. This can be tough.  </p>

<p>IMO, when presented with data, a human being generally associates a set of attributes to data rather than looking at various attributes and selecting the best fit. i.e. On seeing a Lion, a human brain would attach attributes like ferocious, wild, huge, carnivorous, etc. It would be tough, if ten different attributes are given and the one most fitting attribute needs to be assigned. </p>

<p>View User Guide </p>

<p>Similiarly, on observing some file, attributes like, music, favorite, needs_backup, work, picture etc could spring up in mind. But while storing the file it can only be stored in a single directory. Some workaround would be done like storing a favourite picture in directory &#39;pics/favorite&#39;. The problem here is the hierarchy between &#39;pics&#39; and &#39;favorite&#39; is unchangable. Browsing through all favorites from &#39;music&#39;, &#39;pics&#39;, &#39;poems&#39; etc is quite cumbersome. </p>

<p>Tagging is a more intutive way of organizing data. All the attributes of a file can be stored as tags to the file. Browsing through files by the tags associated with them is easy. </p>

<p>The problem is that traditional file systems do not support a tagging structure. </p>

<p>This project aims at making the benefits of tagging available through a traditional filesystem framework like VFS. </p>

<p>The aims of this project are as follows: </p>

<p>Integrate tagging with traditional filesystem (VFS) The directory hierarchies should be dynamically generated depending on the users browsing pattern The filesystem would be implemented using FUSE and fuse-python bindings. </p>

<p>The packages are available for download from the download link. </p>

 title : The icptools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>As networked filesystems become more prevalent, especially in large organizations, users are becoming less and less capable of intelligently/efficiently doing simple operations like copying files. It is not for lack of trying. The fact is that they simply are not equipped with the network/filesystem layout information that is necessary. And neither should they be. This is one of the things administrators are for. </p>

<p>The standard copy tools either treat all filesystems as local (cp) or require the user to choose source and destination hosts (rcp, scp). </p>

<p>icp is different. Based on network/filesystem layout information, icp is able to make intelligent choices about the systems to use in order to perform efficient copy operations--without burdening the user.</p>

 summary : <p>Several features within software used to organize digital content such as photos or music have been key factors to their widespread use, but these functions are mostly absent in traditional file systems, which mostly rely on directory organization and search indexing for file system management. The object of this project is to design and implement a file system that incorporates two functions from these software - chronological view and file tagging - in order to demonstrate the benefits incurred by the precense of these utilities within a traditional file system.</p>

<p>Useful desktop widgets that integrate your commonly available Apple applications with your telephony experience (e.g Click to dial, Call monitoring, Forwarding, Hold, etc) Provide an extendable application that allow you to integrate telephony features to your existing applications using AppleScript Provide a complete Cocoa interface to the Asterisk Manager Interface suitable for corporate use A System Preference pane for ease configuration of the software The Business CaseNearly every office desk that has a computer has a phone next to it. Most corporate Private Branch Exchanges (PBXes) are proprietary solutions limiting an organisation&#39;s telephony experience to the imagination of the PBX manufacturer. Typically these PBXes can&#39;t interact with other information systems available on your corporate network. </p>

<p>Asterisk is a fully feautred Hybrid software PBX that can run a variety of Linux and Unix flavours (including OS X). Being software based it can also make available interfaces for other software products to work with the Asterisk based telephony system. </p>

<p>Resources on your desktop could make your telephony experience a lot smoother e.g Click to dial on your address book, or Caller ID display on screen when your phone rings, or how about your music player pauses when you pick up the phone and resumes playing when you get off the phone. Or simply be able to use desktop style widgets to control your phone and not have to worry about learning how to use a new phone. </p>

<p>Asterisk Tools for OS X, aims to tightly integrate your corporate PBX to your desktop. It will allow your Macintosh to be the control panel for your corporate telephone &amp; greatly increasing its usability making telephony hassle free. </p>

<p>FeaturesNon intrusive user interface Click to dial from the Apple Address Book Hailing appropriate applications (e.g iTunes, etc) to suspend on call Call Console to easily forward, hold and show caller id Call lists (missed, dialed, answered) Add caller to address book if its a new number Sticky notes per phone call Easy configuration using a Preference Pane interface Integration with LDAP directories through Apple Address Book Keychain integration</p>

 title : The drine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Dr.i.n.e. - Drine Is Not Emulator (following up on the idea of http://www.winehq.org/) </p>

<p>Drine is built around concept of UI-Bridging: Android&#39;s  java API+xml is what the user (your) code compiles against,  while each implementation of particular UI-bridge &quot;emulates&quot;  the Android API on particular platform.  Drine currently features two bridges: </p>

<p>1) Drine-SWT - intended to run Android activities on Linux/Windows </p>

<p>as normal desktop apps. Implements Android&#39;s APIs using SWT 
<br/>(Standard Windowing Toolkit from Eclipse) </p>

<p>2) Drine-A.W.Tk - nicked as &quot;Android Web Toolkit&quot; (no pun intended), </p>

<p>as the name implies, it lets android apps run 
<br/>as web apps (Activities Web Server + Browser with Ajax/DHTML) </p>

<p>For more info and some screenshots, check out Drine&#39;s Technical Overview </p>

 title : The locationevent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The software will ask for GPS location information and then you can set a proximity in which to activate an event. </p>

<p>Event can be used to / Actions which will be createdautomatic profile change, phone will change the profile when you arrive to gps location, for example: you arrive to home and the mode will be &quot;silent&quot; an audio alarm on-screen notification automatic sms message automatic instant message automatic voice call automatic timestamp to calendar, so that you can see when you arrive to work and when you leave from work ;) Possible UsagesLocation Aware Profiles Proximity alert to a container Automatic workhour reporting Audio and Visual Notification when navigating Maybe it could be a part of a geocaching software also :) Or when you are going to the summer cottage, your mobile can automatically inform your friends to warm up the sauna ;9 Security Company utility, A security guard will get the location where he should be from security center and the security center will get a notice when guard has arrived to location and also a notice when the guard has left the location. Could be used to see if a door/gate has to opened for a guard, that the mobile which guard is carrying will send an automated message when at the door/gate. Utter DescriptionWhyI think the Location Aware Profiles is the one feature which I miss from my own mobile phone. In my opinion the extra work to remember to switch the profile of the phone isn&#39;t needed when this software is ready. When this software is combined to pseudosatellites then it can be used inside the office building to switch the profile when you enter to the meeting room. The other thing is that I want a software which will collect the information when I arrive to work and when I leave from work. </p>

<p>WhenI will make the first draft samples at the weekend. So be tuned ;) </p>

<p>To Whom? What?The main focus is to give tools to the application developers. The secondary focus is the working application set. </p>

<p>Questions?If you have any questions at all, visit the discussion group and ask. </p>

<p>P.SI will provide all samples which I will create to the svn. So that you can see the code and make things a bit better than me. ;p</p>

<p>Get the codeThere are several ways you can get the code. </p>

<p>1. Use Subversion to get the latest code from the repositoryThe repository is organized on a per chapter code sample basis (the typical Google Code hosting trunk does not have the projects, intentionally).  </p>

<p>To get the code (using svn) for a particular chapter:  svn co http://unlocking-android.googlecode.com/svn/chapterX/trunk/ 
<br/> (Where &quot;chapterX&quot; is replaced by the chapter you want to checkout.) </p>

<p>To get the code (using svn) for all the chapters at once you can use a small script that loops all the chapters.  
<br/> An example of this is shown in the user forum </p>

 title : The writelab Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Based upon a relatively new cross-platform rich client technology code-named Apollo (http://labs.adobe.com/apollo) - now AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime), in this tool the users can: (1) search and browse the Internet; (2) collect, tag and share bookmarks and references; (3) collect, read, tag and annotate PDF files; (4) write and organize notes; (5) chat with other users; (6) write and annotate structured texts; and (7) write hypertexts.  </p>

<p>The rich client works both in online and offline mode. The synching of the data in collaborative writing mode is done via a server, which acts as an access proxy to the relevant data storages (mediaWiki for hypertext, Jabber for chatting, Connotea for bookmarks and references). Depending on the experiences with the users, other interaction modes will be implemented within the client if the users report to use outside tools to communicate with other users (e.g. IP telephony, video chat).  </p>

<p>The backend is written in Rails and glues together the different backends. Still no final decision on the backend (e.g. del.icio.us in addition to Connotea etc.). </p>

<p>The application is also available in a special version for researchers who want to study  collaborative text transformation. </p>

<p>--- News 14.04.2007 A first version of the client will be made  available later this year.. </p>

<p>News 12.05.2007 Another way to describe writeLab would be to call it a Personal Learning Environment (PLE), more about the features for this in a later post. In other news, the backend will be running with Juggernaut to enable server pushing of edits. </p>

<p>News 11.06.2007 Adobe just released Air beta (aka Apollo) and Flex 3 - lot of stuff to digest, but I like the direction. I am currently testing different Wikis as backbones, slowly settling on mediaWiki database structure.</p>

 title : The crmlive Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Nombre del proyecto: CRMOS </p>

<p>El objetivo de este proyecto es desarrollar una herramienta software (CRM) que permita registrar las actividades relacionadas con la atención de clientes de múltiples empresas. Y permita gestionar los contactos que tienen los clientes con su empresa tales como reclamos, solicitud de información, compras, hacer uso de garantías, etc. El registro de esta información le permitirá a la empresa descubrir nuevas oportunidades de negocio, definir estrategias para mejorar la atención al cliente, conocer cuáles son los clientes más rentables y aquellos que no lo son, entre otras cosas. </p>

<p>Por otro lado, la particularidad de este proyecto es que pretende llenar un vacío que existe dentro de la plataforma Microsoft de software Open Source del tipo CRM, por lo que se buscó una licencia con las más amplias libertades (BSD) para que muchos desarrolladores participen y lo implementen en la mayor cantidad de empresas, no habiendo ninguna limitación para la venta, el cobro por implementar, capacitar o desarrollar otros software a partir de este. La única clausula que se pretende aplicar es siempre se debe conservar el nombre origen del código fuente. </p>

<p>La arquitectura de la aplicación debe permitir con solo indicarlo en algún medio de configuración el uso de distintos motores de datos (SQL/MySQL/Oracle/Firebird/etc). Y también de distintos escritorios de modo que la aplicación pueda ser usada no importando si es desde un PC o un dispositivo móvil, o una maquina con pocos recursos. La idea es que quienes implementen este software no tengan que hacer cambios en su plataforma tecnológica, agregando algún otro motor de datos, sino adaptándose a lo que ya existe.  </p>

<p>Debe ser posible implementar este software como ASP por eso es que debe ser multi-empresa. Otro aspecto que se debe considerar es que este software sea ampliable en base a módulos, por ejemplo que dentro de un mismo Framework se pueda agregar un modulo ERP o Groupware, entre otros. </p>

 summary : <p>NEW: updated for WRFV3 on April 30, 2009 </p>

<p>A new home for f90tohtmlf90tohtml has been around for a decade, but, as of 10 July 2008, is new here at code.google.com.  The author of this page is also new to code.google.com, and is uncertain what to expect, and uncertain how to manage this new venue. Hopefully this venue will make f90tohtml more useful to its users.  Perhaps this project can become a community project.  Apologies for letting the old site become outdated.  New project owners and project members are welcome. </p>

<p>By the way, the tip about https at Getting Started with Google Code Hosting  was very helpful.  I had to manually enter https just to upload a new download!  (but no problems in 2009) </p>

<p>Here are some public code browsers, that you can make with f90tohtml: </p>

<p>wrfbrowser, WRF version 3 crmbrowser, CRM version 2.1.2  d2psbrowser </p>

<p>Here are the legacy installation instructions: </p>

<p>What is f90tohtml?f90tohtml is a PERL script that converts FORTRAN source code into HTML.  All the subprogram calls are linked, both forward and backwards.  A clickable calling tree is constructed. A subject index can be made from a user-supplied hash. A search engine, based on regular expressions, searches the code. f90tohtml was developed for the purpose of browsing large numerical weather prediction codes, the University of Oklahoma&#39;s ARPS model, the PSU/UCAR MM5, the NCEP Regional Spectral Model, the Navy&#39;s COAMPS model, and the new community WRF model. f90tohtml is most effective when used on your code; browsing from your own disk is much quicker than over the net. But you may view an online WRF Browser.  The WRF model is v1.3, downloaded from http://www.wrf-model.org on March 30, 2003. The files and scripts that will help you apply f90tohtml to your source of WRF, ARPS5.0 and COAMPS2.0 are bundled with the distribution. How to install f90tohtmlDownload f90tohtml.tar.gz (meaning the latest version). Then gunzip f90tohtml.tar.gz, then tar xvf f90tohtml.tar cd f90tohtml. Then vi f90tohtml and edit the line #!/usr/bin/perl to your path to perl, if need be. The path is usually either /usr/local/bin/perl or /usr/bin/perl.  Also change the path to your f90tohtml directory in the statement $path_f90tohtml=&quot;/home/bfiedler/f90tohtml/&quot;; Then chmod u+x f90tohtml Add f90tohtml to your path in your .cshrc or .bashrc file.  Then cd examples Do the appropriate editing within the first few lines of d2ps_prepare.pl and crm_prepare.pl. In d2ps.f2h change $dir_html in $dir_html=&quot;~/d2psbrowser/&quot;; so that it contains a valid path to where f90tohtml will create a directory d2psbrowser. Do not create the directory d2psbrowser yourself. Such browser directories can always be later moved to your public html directory, or the browser directory can be made there directly.  The search feature will not work until the browser directory is in a directory where cgi works.  Type d2ps_prepare.pl. A directory d2ps_ls and a file src.ls within that directory will be made. Actually,  a d2ps_ls directory comes with the bundle. But within the .ls files, the filepath will be to a certain bfiedler, which, of course, will not work on your code. Now type f90tohtml d2ps.f2h If successful, f90tohtml will tell you where to open your html-ized code with firefox, or a similar browser. If you want use the search engine, move the browser to your public directory. Move grepper.cgi to your personal cgi-bin. The browser is coded to find the cgi-bin at the same level as the browser directory. Make sure you have permissions and the path to perl set correctly. Try making a browser for the NCAR Column Radiation Model; first run crm_prepare.pl, make the appropriate changes within crm.f2h, then f90tohtml crm.f2h. How to use a browserAll the little gif images you see in the browser are not decorations; they all have a purpose. </p>

<p>The green balls open trees.  Links in trees open the calling statement. The cyan balls at call statements open the calling program; the underlined link opens the subroutine being called. The default is for code to open in the bottom window. The colored bars duplicate the bottom window into the top window, which is where you will probably do most of the browsing and clicking.  The duplication feature is very useful for browsing up or down the calling tree. Help for WRF, COAMPS, MM5 and ARPS:Configuration files for WRF, COAMPS, MM5 and ARPS are found within the nwp_codes directory.  Since the source codes are not provided, you will obviously need to obtain a source code before you make a browser. In the &quot;prepare&quot; files (e.g., wrf_prepare.pl), you will need to set $the_path to your source code.  </p>

<p>Repair the first few lines of the Perl script wrf_prepare.pl. Then run it to prepare the appropriate .ls files. Change $dir_html in wrf.f2h . Then type f90tohtml wrf.f2h.  You should be directed to your wrfbrowser.</p>

<p>Agile -- we don&#39;t keep very long iteration to work, all are small sprints Pair programming -- we get up early morning, talk in skype and share our editors to get onto writing code, it is always fun. Early Release -- we believe in release often methodology. Testability -- we write tests first, then the code implementation and also make sure that every code can be tested in unit level. Simplicity -- we want to keep things simple and those that are looks very obvious but the same time easily usable </p>

 summary : <p>vtiger CRM project provides SMBs an easy to install, industrial-strength, business-ready open source CRM. It enables small and medium size businesses to automate Marketing, Sales, and Support functions. vtiger CRM is the leading open source CRM product that is 100% open source. Its browser based client provides user-friendly navigation by applying new web technologies. </p>

<p>From creating marketing campaigns, to tracking leads through sales process, to a self-service portal for supporting customers, vtiger does it all. vtiger is being used every day by hundreds of thousands of SMEs through out the world, and in workgroups in large enterprises.</p>
 summary : <p>Translation of vtigercrm release 5.3 to the Turkish Language </p>

<p>vtiger CRM is 100% Open Source Customer Relationship Management solution built over LAMP/WAMP stack and other third-party open source packages. </p>

<p>vtiger CRM software can be installed in Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 and different types Unix/Linux-based distributions, such as RedHat 7.2/8.0/9.0, Debian 3.0, SuSe 9.0, Fedora Core 3.0, Mandrake 10.0, Mac OS, and FreeBSD. </p>

<p>Please visit Online Demo for more details. </p>

<p>How is vtiger CRM different from other CRM software? </p>

<p>The vtiger CRM software installation is hassle free, as we have bundled well-tested third-party software, such as Apache, MySQL, and PHP along with CRM-specific source code. Most of the other open source CRM software providers offer only the application and ask users either to install all other LAMP/WAMP third-party software or approach them for installation. </p>

<p>The vtiger CRM software provides enterprise quality business enhancement utilities, such as vtiger Outlook Plug-in for Microsoft® Outlook® users, vtiger Thunderbird Extension for Thunderbird/Mozilla users, and vtiger Office Plug-in for Microsoft® Office® users. These utilities are part of the vtiger CRM Open Source project in SourceForge.net. </p>

<p>Currently most of the other Open Source CRM projects are not providing add-ons for Thunderbird Extension and Microsoft® Office® and you have to buy the Microsoft® Outlook® plug-in separately.</p>

 summary : <p>Culturally situated design tools (CSDT&#39;s for short) are a set of interactive web applications created under the leadership of Professor Ron Eglash designed to teach students standard-based mathematics using artifacts from culture based on these and other mathematical principles. Students interact with the web applications, learn the mathematical principles behind the cultural artifacts and develop artwork . These CSDT&#39;s exist and have been a rousing success with teachers across the world (http://www.csdt.rpi.edu). </p>

<p>While the CSDT&#39;s themselves exists, there exists no platform to share creations from these CSDT artworks with people around the world. The goal this summer is to create a working community page for these design tools. This community page will allow groups of individuals (presumably a classroom) to organize and publish their materials in private as well as allowing individuals to publish their CSDT artwork in a &quot;public group&quot;. Interaction between the CSDTs and the community should be as seamless as possible and content posted to this community should be dealt with a context aware manner (i.e.- if a file associated with some particular CSDT is posted, that CSDT should open to display the content).  </p>

<p>This community would be created using Drupal (utilizing a MYSQL database) with contributed code being the modules and module changes needed to utilize these ideas as well as any code needed to help seemlessly interact with the CSDT&#39;s themselves.</p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to the Google Highly Open Participation Contest, Apache Software Foundation section! </p>

<p>What&#39;s this?Google is holding a contest for pre-university students (high school and secondary school students) to encourage younger individuals (from age 13) to participate in open source. </p>

<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), which develops open-source software, is participating in this contest.  The ASF will work with students to complete various tasks.  To learn more about the ASF, please check out http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html. </p>

<p>See also: Contest FAQs and Official Rules.  ASF members and invited guests can also join the internal discussion group. </p>

<p>To be usable by projects of the Apache Software Foundation, all works will have to be licensed under the Apache License, see http://www.apache.org/licenses/ . </p>

<p>How to Get StartedTo get started, see the list of tasks in this project&#39;s issue tracker (that&#39;s the issues tab on top of this page). </p>

<p>How to Get HelpThe ASF being a federation of projects, there is no unique address to ask about the ASF-specific aspects of this program. Each task (in the issue tracker) includes the email address of a project mailing list, specific to the project in question, where you can get help. </p>

<p>Do not use any ASF-wide mailing lists for questions - this will only annoy people and you most probably won&#39;t get help. </p>

<p>How do we coordinate inside the ASFIf you&#39;re an ASF committer (if you have to ask what this is you&#39;re certainly not one), use the asf_ghop discussion group, and/or see the messages that were sent to you PMC recently about this program. You can also suggest tasks via the Tasks page, and project admins will move them to the issue tracker if accepted.</p>

With that in mind I want to explain the system in a way that people outside the systems software research community can understand. I&#39;d also like it to encourage open development and experimentation like Caerwyn&#39;s Inferno Programmer&#39;s Notebook. Eventually I want it to be a common source for Inferno folks to keep an unstable tree with common signers and ndb/locals. That way people can see, upload and look at what everyone is working on. I&#39;m also going to add a set of scripts to allow the quick bringup of a variety of different types of inferno installs(i.e. starting with fs, auth and cpu and moving towards something more buzzwordy like a &quot;cloud&quot; system).  </p>

 summary : <p>The JavaScript Standard Library poses as a proposal for a universal standard toolset for the JavaScript language. </p>

<p>As of its 1.5 version, JavaScript is a powerful and robust language, but it lacks, on top of its neat design, some control structures and paradigms that may help to build concrete applications, and some restrictions and structural specifications to guide the horde of developers on the path to Great Code. </p>

<p>The JS-SL tries to fill this gap by providing a load of tools and object-oriented libraries to be used as a higher code layer to the core JavaScript language. </p>

<p>Of course, JS-SL is cross-browser compliant (well, as far as we know, of course), and intends to keep on track with future JavaScript evolutions, like for instance the upcoming Mozilla draft for JavaScript_ 2.0. </p>

<p>Digital Alien Software Systems is the editor of the JS-SL, under the terms of the MIT OpenSource License. </p>

 title : The khojo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Khojo is technology demostrative project, initiated as weekend project. Most of time we end up getting irrelevant result after googling. Suppose we want to search papers thermodynamics   as a topic of physics, but we end up getting lots of un-rqeuired things and lost in sea of information. End result is frustration. </p>

<p>Can we do something like, we get only relevant results related to particular topic? Can we interact with person who is expert in this field? Can we share the documents, with people  having common interest ? Can we get faster and relevant results ?  </p>

<p>Social search is step in that direction. It is a process of collaborative harvesting, directory-community building, tagging, Question &amp; Answers services, Shared bookmarks and Web pages and local files and documents. 
<br/>The purpose of this project is to enable one person to search the files &amp; folder, archives in his filesystem plus those available in other community members system and those on internet. </p>

<p>User can also search within other dedicated social communities. For that, he need to join those communities. Everything shared can be searched and downloaded on will. </p>

<p>We often find that we have lost something very important code, document, file etc somewhere or it may be case you have given it to some of your friends.The basic purpose is to archieve everything in easily readable format for future use.

 summary : <p>This project is in a pre Alpha dev stage! A lot of the documentation will refere to features yet to be coded. </p>

<p>The idea is fairly simple. Make a python web proxy (transcoder - call it what you will) which allows users to browse the web through any popular modern web browser, but also to use, create and possibly even vote on global, and site specific mods to those sites they visit. These mods would result in layered (mashed) services being dynamically layed on top of, or even replacing the original service/site. Think server-side, browser agnostic GreaseMonkey </p>

<p>Modding agenda categories could be community based, and, if you really want, be referred to as &#39;nations&#39;. </p>

<p>Where possible the APIs offered by &#39;target service&#39; will be used to improve robustness.</p>

 title : The midi2kb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Registration description of Midi2Kb</p>

<p>Dear Open Source Community,</p>

<p>Midi2Kb is currently built on the KeyKit7.4c - interpreter as offered by Tim Thompson on http://nosuch.com/keykit/. In his email-list and by personal email communication he encouraged me to realize Midi2Kb. On my suggestion, he even extended his system to allow to send raw key-messages to other programs, what is extremely useful in combination with free community supported macro-systems.
<br/>KeyKit itself is an object-oriented C-dialect interpreter with a big open user-extendable library, for which Midi2Kb adds the necessary functions to communicate with the community-supported AutoHotKey macro-environment. In the AutoHotKey community there was the wish to enhance AutoHotKey by Midi-input/output.(http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/search.php?
<br/>mode=results&amp;sid=3c35ecd1102826372af082e591e66edd) So I had put there my (already functional) Midi2Kb 0.1 source there (http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic11910.html).
<br/>As finding the optimal keyboard layout and adapting to other user-needs can be accomplished better in a wide open community, the author thinks that this project qualifies as an OpenSource project. To make the program userfriendly, some rewriting and streamlining appears to be necessary. Since programmers for such open projects are a rare resource, a donation based approach (like in SourceForge.net or Bounty Source) could give some additional incentive to find collaboration peers.</p>

<p>All the best to all of us

 summary : <p>My Gallery is the free online community of hundreds of artists from around the world. Join up now http://mygallery.ning.com</p>
 summary : <p>I. Aims</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Build smart multi-linguistic community-developed dictionary
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.1. All languages will be connected together through intermediate languages. For example, you add the word &#39;smart&#39; in Vietnamese-&gt;English and Russian-&gt;English. A connection VietnameseRussian will be added automatically.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.2. Dictionary will assign words with the same synonyms and antonyms to be synonyms and antonyms (if they have the same scope). For example, you add 2 words &#39;smart&#39; &amp; &#39;intelligent&#39; that have antonym &#39;stupid&#39;. Then &#39;smart&#39; &amp; &#39;intelligent&#39; will be synonyms.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.3. Sentences, proverbs, idioms, songs, sayings, excerpts will be connected with words and structures when matches are found. For example, you add the word &#39;love&#39; and someone adds English proverb &#39;A poor beauty finds more lovers than husbands. Then, they will be connected. This feature will create great learning base for all people.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Build personalized dictionary
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dictionaries may not cover everything, hence there should be room for people to share their definitions and understanding about situations and concepts. Some of definitions may become famous quotes. For example, George Bernard Shaw defined democracy in that way: &#39;Democracy is a form of government that substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few&#39;. Another example by Doug Horton: &#39;The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity&#39;.</p>

<p>II. Technical issues
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Programming language
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.1. PHP will be used to develop this web application. CakePHP framework will be used to develop.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.2. C/C++ will be used to develop desktop clients. wxWidgets will be used.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Database
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.1. MySQL will be used for development and production environments.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.2. Data can be exported and imported under XML, SQL, CSV, XLS and ODS formats.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.3. PostgreSQL may be used for better performance.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3. Misc
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Javascript &amp; Ajax will be used to enhance performance and user-friendliness.</p>

 summary : <p>Sometimes you find yourself needing to replace tables on production servers.  While the ideal solution is to take the server out of rotation and replace the table properly, that&#39;s not always feasible. </p>

<p>By default, this app replaces the table layout (.frm file), the data (.MYD file), and indexes (.MYI file).  But the simplicity of Python allows you to customize it to meet your needs.  MySQL is all about freedom and flexibility.  This little app lets you make the most of it.</p>

 summary : <p>iPlayer Gadget </p>

<p>People commonly use computers outside the convenience of their homes and are therefore unable to access their favorite music features. The &quot;iPlayer&quot; gadget will enable users to build and store a personal playlist (or multiple number of playlists) in their iGoogle page. The goal of this gadget is to try and make users feel more at home, whilst away from home, by allowing them to listen to their music from any computer.  </p>

<p>This goal is achieved by giving the users the opportunity to keep their own playlists of songs from YouTube, in a simple and easy-to-use fashion. In order to fit the constraints of using a gadget we will create a separate play list feature and not use the one currently available in YouTube. All the playlist will be saved on the servers. </p>

<p>The main data source for the gadget will be YouTube, which will allow users to import songs to their playlist, and play them on demand. YouTube seems like a good choice seeing as it has an extremely large variety of (free) songs, accessible to anyone from anywhere. </p>

<p>Many extra features are planned to be added, like:  </p>

<p>Sharing you playlists and favorite songs over an &quot;OpenSocial&quot; based community  Showing statistics on the favorite songs among the friends/community Displaying the played song&#39;s lyrics  Fetching a whole album to you&#39;re playlist according to the disc&#39;s name or Artist&#39;s/band&#39;s name  EXT... </p>

 summary : <p>About AppCoreLibUseful classes for building scalable Flex RIA&#39;s. </p>

<p>AppCoreLib is a collection of useful classes that facilitate easy RIA development with regards to XML based data being pulled in.  The general approach is that an application needs to load various content/setting files prior to loading the UI.  Through a series of simple checks, an application can then load the UI once those dependencies have been loaded or alert the user if they have not. </p>

<p>AppCoreLib provides simple XMLDataBroker classes with convenience methods that allows easy traversal of the XML data using simple IDs. </p>

<p>News/Updates2008.05.12Added a tutorial using AppCoreLib&#39;s XMLDataBroker, mock XML data and a Cairngorm command.  Check it out here </p>

<p>2008.04.30Added a much needed property for the XMLLoadEvent.  Now when an XMLLoadEvent.XML_LOAD_SUCCESS occurs, the event will have the actual XML attached via the xml and data (redundant and deprecated) properties. </p>

<p>2008.04.23There has been considerable dev efforts in getting the ClassUtil methods standardized.  As such I decided to start taking snapshots of the source so you can build from previous version if you want. </p>

<p>v1.0.20080214 svn url - link 2008.03.26Added asdocs finally.  Expect further development on ClassUtil as there are some missing conversion functions that need to be implemented. </p>

<p>2008.02.20Added a new class: ClassUtil.  ClassUtil contains methods to translate generic objects to specific class types.  Hopefully not too many folks have been using ObjectUtil just yet so this should affect very few of you.  If so, you can still continue to use ObjectUtil for awhile until I can finally remove it.    </p>

<p>deprecated ObjectUtil (use ClassUtil instead) added ClassUtil </p>

<p>2007.12.28I am currently having issues with my asdoc compiler.  So right now there are no docs.  I am working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.  All the source code has asdoc comments in it.  I will also be uploading an example file.</p>

<p>For example, if you were to write software for writing novels, you might have 3 workspaces: one for character biographies, one for notes, and one for the actual story.  The workspace for character biographies would have an activity that lists characters where you could add, edit, or delete characters.

 title : The dytos Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In a better world, entity beans would have been the perfect solution for RIAs remote data access needs . In a universe where phisics laws didn&#39;t matter (or at least if java object marshalling/unmarshalling and network access overhead were negligible), entity beans could have remote access to timely data, solving at the same time important things (for us architects) like locking, caching, etc. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, fine grained remote access per attribute cost is too high (that&#39;s one of the reasons why early J2EE apps performance sucked). The now &quot;classic&quot; service facade architecture with dtos came to solve this problem. DTOs are transferred between the business logic and presentation tiers. All data access in the presentation layers results in a coarse grained remote call to get the DTO and lots of fine grained local calls to access the individual attributes. </p>

<p>DTO based webapps can transfer data according to presentation layer specific needs for a screen/page/use case. This has the advantage of being very efficient in terms of remote access but also extremely rigid because of its tight couplig to the view, limiting the effective reuse of these services. Actually, the resulting coupling (and the reuse potential of the services) is not very different than putting business logic directly in the web controller (ok, I&#39;m exaggerating a bit but I think my point is reasonably clear) </p>

<p>To avoid this coupling we can build services with interfaces that are completely oblivious to the fact that they are going to be used by certain controllers / web views and wrap them by &quot;frontier&quot; services that are in charge of translating between the DTO and business logic worlds / languages, etc, building the specific DTOs. Depending of the presentation layer needs, we may arrive to a situation where we can have several &quot;presentation&quot; services accessing the same business logic service. </p>

<p>In a classic webapp, this phisical separation between presentation and business logic in different tiers (processes) is rarely needed. If we colocate both layers we can avoid all these remote calls that complicated our nice little webapp and we can use all of our ORM niceties like lazy references and paged collections. </p>

<p>But in a RIA we don&#39;t have the luxury of running all our clients in the same server. So, what gives? Should we all run and come back to our dreaded DTOs asking for forgiveness? What we all really want (in this context, no sexual references here) is a remote hibernate session. </p>

<p>We are trying to solve exactly this. Dynamic Transfer Object strive to be a generic DTO service that can wrap almost any kind of business logic / data access service and allows us (client apps) to efficiently navigate arbitrary object graphs transparently accessing remote data when necessary. DyTOs represent a &quot;view&quot; of domain objects, allowing us to project only the required information and transparently retrieving remote data from the server. DyTOs are updatable, can have &quot;local&quot; methods and invoke remote logic (on the &quot;reflected&quot; remote entities.) Updates are logically transferred to the server in a change log to be applied to the remote entities.</p>

 summary : <p>Application retirement is a viable strategy for eliminating redundant legacy applications, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.  By reducing the number of applications within the IT infrastructure, DBAs can concentrate on maintaining critical business applications with the highest value to the organization, instead of compiling data from disparate sources. Enterprise data management application provides companies with a centralized solution to manage the test data management process for clone creation, productivity and data security. </p>

<p>With e-Business suite archiving organizations can create and deploy effective and consistent policies for managing, securing and storing data from a single console. The result is improved application performance and availability through smaller production database sizes, shorter backup and recovery times, reduced labor costs to maintain the production system and lower storage costs.</p>

<p>Scope of this project </p>

<p>Includes a faithful implementation of the RETE/UL algorithm as described by Robert B. Doorenbos. Uses the SharpDevelop IDE and the Boo programming language for rule authoring and compilation. Includes AlphaNode evaluators (Equals, notEquals, lessThan, etc.) to eliminate unnecessary alpha matches up-front. Full range of builtin functions, including list functions. Conflict Resolution strategies Mutual Exclusion (mutex) definition and evaluation. Overrides - where one rule can disable another based on priority. Aggregate functions (sum, average, etc.) Assert Business Objects as facts, and SET properties and/or INVOKE methods on them. Special support for the Neo ORM solution, creating fact enabled business objects without using reflection. High-level features </p>

<p>Extremely fast. Written in C#, not ported from some other language. Simple, but powerful rule authoring syntax. Assumptions </p>

<p>.net and mono compatible. Commercial support available. Related resources </p>

<p>Here are a few alternatives for comparison... </p>

<p>NxBRE is the first open-source rule engine for the .NET platform and a lightweight Business Rules Engine (aka Rule-Based Engine) SRE (Simple Rule Engine) is a lightweight forward chaining inference rule engine for .NET. Its &#39;simple&#39; because of the simplicity in writing and understanding the rules written in XML, but this &#39;simple&#39; engine can solve complex problems. Drools.NET is a Business Rules Engine (BRE) based on Charles Forgy&#39;s Rete algorithm. Developers can now exploit a powerful Rule Engine through a completely managed .NET code base! Drools.NET is based on Jboss Rules, and comes with all the features of that Rules Engine.</p>

 summary : <p>Gerbil wants to move ERP into the cloud.Gerbil under development here. </p>

<p>The world of production makes use of an assortment of open and closed source solutions to facilitate the organization, management, and analysis of business process workflows.  Most modern ERP systems attempt to provide software for the main processes involved, namely:  Data organization, analysis, and management.  Most real world systems that are employed by production facilities are a hodgepodge of a document editor suite (plain,spreadsheet,Gantt,diagram and presentation), a meeting/planning scheduling system (calendar), a database to warehouse transactional data, and a visualization system meant to help analyze the processes of the system.  Google Docs is easily interfaced with Google Gadgets.  Both are systems that run on the Google cloud, and are readily available to any internet connection, provided a suitable browser is used.  When coupling these systems through an encrypted channel, business can be fully distributed and requires no investment in terms of physical hardware, save the channel in which the system is accessed through.  Further more, this base software suite is constantly being maintained by the able hand of Google&#39;s own development staff, thereby providing a solid infrastructure in which to grow the scale of production as a business expands. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Initially, this project will be aimed at Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, which have the most benefit of a cloud based system.</p>

 title : The gmuair Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The project is to implement an on-line travel reservation application with a web front-end for both the travelers and the reservation manager. The customer should be able to register him/herself with the reservation site, enter personal profile information (name, address, email, and credit card information), prepare for itineraries, and book flights. The reservation manager should be able to publish and update flight information, and generate inventory report. </p>

<p>The project uses Apache Tomcat Server version 6.0 and Java SE version 5.x. </p>

<p>RequirementsThe following functionalities are provided for the reservation manager or administrator: A web page for the manager to log in with username and password. One or more web pages for the user to add/cancel/list flights with the following information: airline code/name, flight number, departure location, departure day of the week/time, arrival location, arrival day of the week/time, cost of business class and cost of economy class ticket. The flight number is a 3-digit number, prefixed with 0’s if less the actual number is less than 100. For simplicity reasons, it is predefined that there are 10 seats of business class and 30 seats of economy class seats in each flight. The airline code is a two-letter code defined in http://www.tvlon.com/resources/airlinecodes.htm. The airport location is one of airport with a three-letter code defined in http://www.orbitz.com/App/global/airportCodes.jsp. When a flight is canceled in the application, then all itineraries that are reserved and booked will become canceled as well.The inventory report will contain a summary of all fights in the reservation system that still have any unsold seats, the total number of unsold seats of business class and economy class. The user is able to log out at any stage during his/her session. The following functionalities are provided for on-line consumers: A web page for a traveler to register him/herself with name, address, username and password, email address, as well as credit card information (optional), including a 16-digit card number and a 4-digit expiration date. As a convenience for this project, a valid combination of credit card number and expiration date is defined in such a way that the 4-digit expiration date is defined with a valid mmdd format, and as an integer is a denominator of the 16-digit card number. A web page for a traveler to log in with username and password. Once a traveler is logged in, he/she will be shown with a list of travel itineraries along with the status of each itinerary (reserved, booked, or canceled). A travel itinerary is a travel arrangement with one or more flights. It has the status reserved when it is created by a traveler, booked when it is paid, and canceled when it is deleted by the traveler from his/her itinerary list, or one of the flights in the itinerary becomes canceled by the reservation manager, or payment not received after 2 minutes (simulating the 24 hours holding period in the real world). A web page that allows the user to view airport information on Google map. A traveler is able to create and book an travel itinerary by going through the following steps: Search for flight information by providing departure/arrival date/time and location, number of passengers, one-way or round trip, and the max number of legs. A list of available itinerary options will be shown to the on-line traveler, with departure/arrival and cost information. The departure time will be plus or minus hours within the specified departure time. It is possible that one itinerary contains one or more flights from one or more different airlines. Once the traveler selected an itinerary from the list, he or she has the option to reserve it. Before the traveler can reserve the selected itinerary, he or she must be logged in. Once the traveler reserved an itinerary, he or she has the option to book it by providing payment information via credit card. If the credit card information is not on-file for the traveler, he or she will be prompt to enter the credit card information (number and expiration date). The credit card information has to be validated first before booking. The validation is done via a validation service, which will be provided by the instructor. Once the credit card is validated, the traveler will be shown with the actual ticket information. The ticket number is automatically generated by the application in the format of XX-FFF-YYYYYY-ZZZ, where XX is the airline code, FF is the 3-digit flight number, YYYYYY is the traveler’s login name, and ZZZ is a 3-digit sequence number generated by the application. The sequence number is unique for each traveler. If the credit card number is invalid, a web page with an error message will be displayed to the user and ask the user to re-enter the credit card information. A traveler is able to cancel an itinerary from his/her itinerary list if it has not been paid. Cancellation after payment is not permitted. The traveler should be log out at any stage during his/her session. If the traveler is logged out during the preparation of an itinerary without completing the purchase, all itinerary information will be lost. The next time when the traveler is logged in, he or she will have to start a new selection process. The application is developed in a multi-tier architecture with each tier implemented using the technologies and free software defined as follows: The presentation tier is a web application consisting of a combination of HTML/JavaScripts/GoogleMaps and JSP components. The JSPs may contain JavaScripts functions for validating input fields with predefined string and/or number format (e.g. credit card number and expiration date). The business tier of the application contains the business logic and processes with connections to the backend database via JDBC, implemented using Java Servlets. The database tier of the application is a database server used to store all relevant data of the application. The HyperSonic database (HSQL, version 1.8), a lightweight database written in Java, should be used to support the application. The software is freely downloadable from http://hsqldb.org. The in-process mode of HSQL should be used for the application. The database files shall be located in a designated location in the Web Archive (war) hierarchy and the application should not hard-wired to specific data file location. It shall find the location of the data files dynamically. In addition to the database, the backend of the application also contains a credit card validation server (provided by the instructor). The validation server application is implemented as a Servlet application and provided by the instructor. Detailed usage and access APIs will be given during the class. A Web service is implemented to provide flight inventory information via standard Web Service interfaces that supports two query operations. One is to get the total number of seats for both business class and economic class for a given date; the other is to get the total number of seats of both business and economic class for a date range from the current date.</p>

<p>Organizations rarely have the capacity to design, build and deploy technology to manage grants. While money may not be a problem, time most definitely is at a premium. Many organizations need to deploy a solution quickly in order to modernize their grantmaking processes. While grant processes appear to be unique to every grantmaker, this project attempts to define a generic end-to-end grant process that can be used by any organization. This is called the GrantMaker LogicModel. A presentation on the business case behind open source grants.</p>

 title : The idisc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims at the development of an Object-Oriented Application Framework that helps the application developers develop small business applications (applications between 300 to 700 Function Points) with minimum effort. It attempts to provide a system that takes up most of the development responsibilities of the user in a software project and assists him throughout the system development life cycle. The idea is quite simple. The developer specifies the system in the form of business objects, business rules, and business processes and system generates deploy able java applications from these specifications.  </p>

<p>The major expected outcome of the system is a working application framework that reduces the recurrent tasks performed by the developers during the development of similar business applications. </p>

 summary : <p>This project is an effort to describe a modern IT architecture with focus on structuring a service for small and large corporations using open source technologies. </p>

<p>The objective is to identify service and technology directions to leverage the Internet, cloud computing and conventional computing facilities, to define, optimize and deliver IT services for an organization. </p>

<p>Key subject topics include: </p>

<p>Mission Statement Business architecture IT requirement IT governance process IT services Application architecture Information architecture Infrastructure architecture Glossary Project operation is supported by an identified IT architecture, e.g. chosen service/technology for this project to function. </p>

<p>DefinitionsThis project will develop and present a service-centric approach to define IT services, organize such services using open source technologies configured to meet identified characteristics for service delivery in-hose and/or hosted externally. </p>

<p>The audience is anyone from a one-person small business to a medium size operation, to a large enterprise, profit or non-profit organization looking for input, ideas and reference material in defining the structure, components, properties and resources needed for IT in support of an operation, a business or function.  </p>

<p>In some instances, IT may be seen as a cost item. In others, IT is a strategic vehicle through which the primary business is expanded and IT services are available to partners or even competitors. In other enterprises, IT is the business.  </p>

<p>Information technology architecture must be defined in context of an enterprise, small or large, public or private, need to define and manage operations, processes, applications, information, technology, automation and associated services in support of the corresponding business or function of said enterprise; IT is part of an enterprise architecture. </p>

<p>The following definitions are proposed. </p>

<p>Enterprise architectureEnterprise architecture is defined as the organization&#39;s structure, associated processes, personnel and organizational units, sub-units, partners, culture, behaviour, target audience, target services and information systems, aligned with core goals and strategic direction. The associated components of an enterprise architecture are generally agreed to include the following </p>

<p>Business architecture. Business architecture defines and guides the strategy, goals, corporate policies and business processes of an organization. Application architecture. The application architecture component defines and guides the development, deployment and ongoing management of applications supporting the business. Information architecture. The information architecture component defines and guides the management of corporate information, associated metadata, taxonomy, usability, source, tracking, history, context, confidentiality, archiving and retention policies. Infrastructure architecture. The infrastructure architecture defines and guides the management of computing facilities, topology, network, security model, storage, servers, server and application hosting, email, service desk, service continuity, disaster recovery and general technology, mobility and automation services.  Thus the definition of IT architecture is proposed as follows </p>

<p>IT ArchitectureIT architecture defines and guides the technology based services and technology strategy in support of an enterprise as documented by component application, information and infrastructure architectures.  </p>

<p>The areas developed here will be grouped in the subjects listed above as pragmatic components, the minimum set of reference points for technology in support of an enterprise and hence used as table of content for the site.</p>

 title : The nvalidate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Design goalsAbility to handle real-world complexity. Validate objects and object graphs, not just value types. Switch validation rules in defined contexts. Separation. Keep validation code out of your classes. Centralize it. Use it on classes from external libraries. Centralization. Allow validation to be centrally configured. Or allow configurations from different sources to be merged. At runtime, access your whole application&#39;s validation ruleset in one place. Usability. Make invalid objects discoverable and investigable. Don&#39;t discover invalid objects by catching exceptions. Configurability. Make validation easy to set up. It shouldn&#39;t be overkill to use NValidate on small projects. There will be no dependencies on external assemblies (other than the core .NET or Mono assemblies.) But it must also scale up for enterprise systems and highly complex configuration requirements. BackgroundNValidate has grown out of the development of an enterprise commerce system built to support multiple retail and wholesale outlets, each with its own business rules, in a single database. We needed validation rules that could be implemented once, managed enterprise-wide, and varied for a given domain model for different contexts: localized web sites, business partners having variations on core business rules, and so on. The validation rules had to function identically across tiers: in the UI, in the business logic, and in the data access layer. Validation results in one tier had to be available up and down the stack rather than forcing each tier to revalidate the same data. </p>

<p>There are libraries to validate web page input. There are libraries to validate function parameters. There are libraries to validate database input. </p>

<p>We couldn&#39;t find a validation library to address all of those needs, so we started work on NValidate. </p>

<p>Different kinds of validationConsider the phone number &quot;888-FON-NMBR.&quot; </p>

<p>Is it translatable into valid a phone number in the U.S.? How about in Nepal? Does the phone number exist? Can a local-only phone account call it? Here&#39;s a trickier one. Imagine a ContactInfo object. Is &quot;888-FON-NMBR&quot; valid for theContactInfo.PhoneNumber property if theContactInfo.Country equals &quot;United States&quot;? What if thetheContactInfo.Country equals &quot;Nepal&quot;? </p>

<p>What is valid is different in each of these contexts. NValidate allows you to define contexts with different validation rules. Contexts can overlap. Rules can be inclusive or exclusive. We&#39;re seeking to add flexible semantics to the question, &quot;Is this valid?&quot; and yet provide a programming tool that allows for clear delineation of those semantics.</p>

 title : The peoplepress Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PeoplePress is a lightweight business directory application.  Need a clean, simple way to host a database of people and businesses on your site?  This is the tool for you. </p>

<p>A Brief HistoryPeoplePress grew out of the needs of BendTech.com, a loose affiliation of technical professionals in Central Oregon.  One of the goals of BendTech is to help organize the grassroots efforts by individuals and businesses in the area who are trying to grow the local technology industry, many of whom said the biggest problem they had was knowing what resources were available. </p>

<p>In order to address this problem, BendTech decided to (quickly) build a simple, easy-to-use, member-maintained business directory.  Hence, PeoplePress. </p>

<p>Why mention this?  Well, you&#39;ll notice that PeoplePress is currently heavily BendTech branded.  This isn&#39;t that hard to change, but does require tweaking some PHP and CSS.  We&#39;ll address this in future releases. </p>

<p>FeaturesPeoplePress has the following features: </p>

<p>Simple UI - Users should just &quot;get it&quot;, with little if any instruction required User Maintained - Users can create, edit, and delete entries w/ no moderation or intervention required by the site administrators. Spam Detection - Includes Akismet spam filtering support - just provide your WordPress API key to enable! Lite Authentication - Users are not required to register or login, which makes participation in the directory trivially easy. Password Protected Entries - Users password protect their entries to prevent unauthorized changes. Google Maps Integration - Provides a google map of all entries in the database with a valid address. Easy Administration - A master password allows site administrators to edit and remove any entry if needed. </p>

<p>Not a feature, but worth calling out: </p>

<p>&quot;Secure-ish&quot; - Passwords are stored MD5 encoded in the database, but they are sent as cleartext over HTTP.  Which means this isn&#39;t this most secure product in the world... but you get what you pay for.  Anyone interested in fixing this is welcome to submit code patches.</p>

<p>(For a quick introduction to rule engines see: InfoQ: Real-World Rule Engines) </p>

<p>To build professional business applications the business processes must be represented in the application. </p>

<p>These can of course be hard-coded or based on different coded modules. </p>

<p>Business needs are different though. Businesses need to adopt fast to new circumstances and the business people that have the knowledge about processes most of the times are not skilled programmers. </p>

<p>The java-world knows many Rule Engines, for example JBoss Rules to just mention one. </p>

 summary : <p>UNDER CONSTRUCTIONRelease 0.1 scheduled for March 31, 2008While Business Works can ultimately make a huge increase in developer productivity, the learning curve for producing production quality services is very high.  Your typical 3GL Developer (C, C++, C#, Java, etc...) will not have experience with a 100% graphical development tool and can become frustrated with the coding and debugging life cycle that makes up a large portion of any software development effort. </p>

<p>To ease the learning curve and ensure a successful first experience, one approach is to leverage the work of experienced Business Works developers.  The TTB project is a tool for implementing this approach as it provides an open source framework and libraries for TIBCO&#39;s Business Works. </p>

 title : The dead-simple-command-lookups Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>One of the little tricks (I want to stay away from the word &quot;hack&quot;) that I like to use for utility programs is to drive them from a command file. I won&#39;t dignify the syntax of these various command files with the word &quot;language&quot; (as in Domain Specific Language), but I find that it makes development much faster for me. I always use a very simple syntax. I don&#39;t use XML (why? that&#39;s for another day), but rather a very simple character delimited syntax where each command is on its own line, and the first character of each line is the delimiter. I picked up this last idea from sed, where you can start the search-and-replace pattern with any character in case you need to use the standard delimiter (the forward-slash) within your text patterns. This also makes it easy to tokenize the command and parameters with operators like &quot;split.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;ve wanted to learn how directly drive a program from the various commands without using if/then or case statements. I&#39;ve been able to figure this out for the languages I use most (C++, Java, Python and Shell script). I&#39;m not too concerned with performance here, but I do like to be able to reduce the repetition in my code. In scripting-to-compiled-language order, here are the ways that I have implemented this lookup. </p>

<p>The code repository contains one sample program in each language (that I&#39;ve implemented so far...) and one file of test data that drives all sample programs. </p>

<p>Shell </p>

<p>This is the simplest, and &quot;palm-to-the-forehead&quot; obvious once I figured it out. I create a shell function with the name of each command, and call each function directly. </p>

<p>Python </p>

<p>Here I put each parameter into an array and pass the array. I use a class that has methods that are named the same as the commands. </p>

<p>Java </p>

<p>Here, like Python, I use a class with methods that have the same name as the commands, and use reflection to look up the methods. </p>

<p>C++ </p>

<p>No built-in language help here, so I use an array that gets turned into a map for quicker lookup. I know I said above that I wasn&#39;t interested in performance. I have, however, developed a distinct distaste for linear algorithms when coding in C++ (it only takes one performance problem to make it obvious) so I tend towards algorithms with better O-numbers (like trees or hashes) whenever possible. </p>

<p>CSharp </p>

<p>Use reflection (similar to Java). </p>

<p>Visual Basic </p>

<p>Use reflection like C# </p>

 title : The hfcserrataparser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A small project hacked together to parse, merge, sort, and display the errata for the excellent Head First C# book. </p>

<p>To use, just download the zip file from the Featured Download link to the right, unzip it, and click the executable file. There&#39;s no need to install the program -- it will work right from the .exe file. Once you start it up, you should find that the program is quite easy to use. Just filter out the types of errors you don&#39;t want to bother with or the ones not included in your edition of the book, and optionally choose a range of pages to look at, and click Display Matching Errata. Once your errata have been displayed, you can either view them right in the program (personally, I just keep it up and running while reading the book) or you can save them to a text file or copy them to your clipboard using the buttons at the bottom right.</p>

 title : The jimp-imp-meta-parser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JIMP (JIMP IMP Meta Parser)JIMP was created in the Fall of 2006 by Matt and Justin Hawkins as a final project for their Programming Language Theory class taught by Professor Aaron D. Stump of Washington University.  And has been convereted into an open source project to benefit the community. </p>

<p>Whats JIMP?JIMP is a parser and interpreter for IMP programs which have been defined in its syntax.  It takes in a file on the command line and provides the output of that IMP program to the  user.  If any run-time errors are found in the IMP program; a corresponding error message will be provided. </p>

<p>Whats IMP?Since you have made it far enough to actually discover an IMP parser and interpreter, you undoubtedly know something about IMP already.  If not; you must be here by mistake.  However, you are still interested in finding more information on IMP, please visit the the IMP language wiki page:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMP_programming_language. </p>

<p>JIMP Syntax Rules:The syntax of JIMP is defined by a number if different token characters.  Each token requires a space between it and the next in order for JIMP to successfully parse every piece.  We realize this can be a bear on the one writing the application; but lets face it; a little extra spacing never hurt anyone.  It also forces your program to be readable. </p>

<p>Category      SyntaxA (aexpr)    : *number* | car L | A + A | A - A | A * A  </p>

<p>B (bexpr)    : { true | false | !B | A &gt;= A | A  A | A &lt; A | A == A | A != A | A lequal A | A gequal A | A less A | A greater A | B || B | B &amp;&amp; B | car L } </p>

<p>C (comm)   : &lt;&lt; skip | while B C | let int|bool|list varname A|B|L | print  varname | varname := A|B|L | ? B : C C | C &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; </p>

<p>L (list)          : ( nil | cons A L | cons B L | cdr L ) </p>

<p>Comments : /  Put comments here, embedding comments in comments does not work ( Don&#39;t feel bad; c++ doesn&#39;t like this / / / / either ). / </p>

<p>Examples:/* list reversal */</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; let list X := ( cons [ 1 ] ( cons [ 2 ] ( cons [ 3 ] ( nil ) ) ) ) &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; let list Y := ( nil ) &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; while { ! { isnil X } }</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>   &lt;&lt; Y := ( cons [ car X ] Y ) &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>   &lt;&lt; X := ( cdr X ) &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; print Y &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>/* exponentiation */</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; let int X := [ 2 ] &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; let int Y := [ 5 ] &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; let int Z := [ 1 ] &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; while { [ Y ] &gt;= [ 1 ] }</p>

<p>   &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>      &lt;&lt; Z := [ [ Z ] * [ X ] ] &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>      &lt;&lt; Y := [ [ Y ] - [ 1 ] ] &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>   &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; print Z &gt;&gt;More Info:A web based version of JIMP (Known as JIMPplet) exists.  JIMPplet can be found at http://cec.wustl.edu/~jth5/cs535/bin/ .  Also there, you can find several example JIMP programs to get you started.</p>

 title : The lemon-parser-generator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Lemon is a LALR parser generator for C, C++ and D languages. It does the same job as GNU bison and yacc; however, Lemon is not another bison or yacc clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a parsing engine that is both reentrant and thread-safe. </p>

<p>Original version of Lemon was written by Dr. Richard Hipp and resides in the public domain. It is maintained as part of the SQLite project. This version was forked from sqlite-3.5.6 and put under GPL license.</p>

 title : The moxl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Java/XML technology landscape seems to be very fragmented. It&#39;s great that every XML specification you can imagine has been implemented somehow somewhere by someone, but getting everything all integrated so you can actually use it is not an easy task. </p>

<p>I want an XML library that I can use in my Java programs. I want to constrain my XML documents by the &#39;best-of-breed&#39; XML schema technology out there: RelaxNG. But I don&#39;t care for DTDs, nor any of that other old SGML baggage. XPath is cool, I want that built-in! I don&#39;t care for support for ancient JDKs, I want generics! I don&#39;t need my API to be designed around other languages, good solid native support for Java only please. And finally, this may sound controversial but I really don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need to &#39;plug in&#39; other XML parsers. Just build one in that does the job and that will be fine. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any free software on the internet that does all this stuff, so I&#39;ve done it myself. It&#39;s not all complete (yet) but getting there. If you share my feelings about XML, don&#39;t be shy- get in touch: Just mail me at malcolm@congreve.com. </p>

 summary : <p>AtUnitAtUnit minimizes boilerplate code in unit tests and guides test development by enforcing good practices.   </p>

<p>mark exactly one field with @Unit to indicate the object under test. mark fields with @Mock or @Stub to obtain mock objects inject your tests, and your test subjects, using your favorite IoC container Mock Objects IntegrationAtUnit integrates with JMock or EasyMock to provide mock objects: </p>

<p>obtain a JMock context simply by declaring a field annotate fields with @Mock to obtain JMock or EasyMock mock objects annotate fields with @Stub to obtain a JMock or EasyMock stub object ... or you can use your own mock objects plug-in with two easy steps: </p>

<p>implement the MockFramework interface annotate your tests with @MockFrameworkClass(MyMockFramework.class) </p>

<p>Container IntegrationAtUnit integrates with Guice or Spring to take all of the work out of dependency-injected tests. </p>

<p>With Guice: </p>

<p>never see the Injector, never write bootstrapping boilerplate! @Inject test class fields without even defining a Module declaratively obtain mock objects with @Inject @Mock if you need more binding flexibility, simply have your test class implement Module </p>

<p>With Spring: </p>

<p>annotate fields with @Bean to get them from the Spring context fields annotated with @Bean which do not appear in your Spring context are added to it automatically!  (This includes @Mock and @Stub fields.) AtUnit looks for a Spring XML file with the same name as your test, or you can specify the location yourself with @Context(&quot;filename&quot;) Most of the time, you don&#39;t even need a Spring XML file! </p>

<p>You can easily plug in other containers in two steps: </p>

<p>implement the Container interface annotate your tests with @ContainerClass(MyContainer.class) </p>

<p>UnOfficial Japanese Language Pack for Trunk is Mozilla</p>
 summary : <p>This package helps ease the pain of exporting DocBook XML equations, figures, and tables from Mathematica. DocBook is a file format that can be transformed into PDF, HTML, and other formats. DocBook accepts many different formats for equations and figures. Among them are MathML, PNG, and PDF. Manually creating all these different versions of a figure or equation would be time consuming. Tables containing symbolic math considerably multiply the magnitude of the problem. This Mathematica package is designed to speed up the common cases of equation, figure and table exports. Also, it includes an Ant build file that can be used to make Mathematica export in batch mode and build documentation in PDF, HTML, and XHTML formats. This is a complete rewrite of the package for DocBook 5 Beta 8 or greater with DocBook XSL 1.71.0 or greater. The unsupported old version that exports against DocBook 4 is included as exDBML.m. </p>

<p>This project was base on the Wicket 1.4-SNAPSPHOT trunk to add some conventions over configuration, to quickly setup small projects.  </p>

<p>If you are interesting about some ideas, sources of this project, I recommend to take the sources directly in your projects and adapt them. Also, there are plenty of samples in the code base you can checkout to see samples of use. </p>

<p>I currently do not have a lot of time to work on this project (since working on other ones also). But when i will have some, the API could change and the project will incude some usfull wicket components among with other refactors. </p>

<p>Main ideas of this projets are: </p>

<p>Refactor of the reloadable classloader that uses a static configuration and thus limits one wicket aplication per web.xml Refactor of the Guice integration Refactor of the testing abilitis, to remove junit coulping What is wicket-contrib ?wicket-contrib is a library that enhances current Wicket Framework http://wicket.apache.org/ : </p>

<p>Better Guice integration : http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Better reloading features Better Test features RequirementWorks with wicket 1.4 on JDK 5 or more. This the the current development version of wicket, so there is at the moment not releases of wicket-contrib but just snapshots </p>

 title : The x2o Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>x2o Object Publishing System and xDrupal Systemx2o is an open source project established for the following goals: </p>

<p>Create a system to use XML schemas to generate XForms and related XML-based GUIs Build a customization layer into this process so that the generated forms can be tailored to specific needs and intents. Establish a data publishing layer to simplify the creation, modification, submission and  processing of XML designed to work with the GUIs. Establish a work flow management system for viewing and approving or rejecting records built via x2o. To do this, x2o works on top of two open source technologies - the eXist XML Database and the Mozilla Firefox XForms add-on, though implementations to other projects and vendors will be included in the near future. </p>

<p>2008-09-21 As mentioned about a month ago, this site is now being revised to reflect a number of significant changes to the architecture and direction for the x2o site. One of the most significant is an agreement by the site organizers to focus upon the use of an XRX (XQuery/REST/XML-Enabled Client) in order to build a content management system around the eXist database. </p>

<p>There are a large number of content management systems currently extant, with no few of them built around XML generated content. However, one of the realizations that several of us have made is that of all of the architectures currently in use, one of the most compelling is that employed by the Drupal CMS, which has been under development since 2000. Drupal incorporates a number of fantastic features, from an effective module system, to the use of database views as a mechanism for building web components in a systematic fashion, to the deployment of a logical and sensible arrangement for dealing with taxonomy and categorization. </p>

<p>We believe that many of these same features can work quite effectively if based upon an XQuery system such as that provided by the eXist database, and that there is a strong architectural similarity between the Drupal system and the x2o system as it has evolved (a similarity that was not completely accidental, as Drupal has been at least a subconscious model for a number of the developers for quite some time). </p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, these changes will be incorporated into the x2o system and existing content on the x2o site will be replaced with the (much more up-to-date) x2o/xDrupal documentation. </p>

 title : The data-lifecycle-management Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Information is a key asset to any organization. Organizational regulatory compliance covers data storage, archival, encryption, retrieval and security. It emphasizes the need to maintain data quality and integrity.? There are many regulatory acts that require the organization to show how data lifecycle management activities comply with them. ? </p>

<p>This has resulted in organizations investing in data management technologies to tackle compliance. Companies nowadays invest in highly secure network platforms that act as data centers, which can be leveraged in different environments. Along with these tools, regulatory compliance software is also deployed to manage compliance in today?s rapidly changing regulatory environment. This enables the organization to face audits, both internal and external, and provide reliable and secure information to demonstrate compliance with regulatory bodies.?</p>

 summary : <p>Frustrated by the document editors of his day, kidko set out to write something that does exactly what others don&#39;t: automatically manage chapters and sections with ease, track characters, motivation, and plot. All within the realm of Open Source Software. </p>

<p>Current Milestone: 0.3 </p>

<p>ProBookAn application tailored especially for book and story writers, ProBook is still in early (pre-alpha) development stages. Plans are in place to include a variety of functions, including strict control over the fonts used for chapter headings, the title page, and the body text itself. Control of a similar amount is available over the page size, ranging from US Letter, to half-letter (resulting in two pages per sheet of paper), and Size A paperback sheets. In addition to the PBOOK file format itself, which will hold all of your book&#39;s information, non-ProBook users can read your book when you export it to the common PDF format, or as a web-capable HTML document. And there are the specialized character management fields to track their motivation as both goals and likes/dislikes, and with notes for anything ProBook forgot. </p>

<p>Milestones0.0 Start Project 0.1 Dummy Interface 0.2 Chapter Editing/Retainment 0.2.5 Character Editing/Retainment 0.3 Saving 0.5 HTML export 0.7 Direct Printing 1.0 PDF export Note that only the Linux binaries are updated regularly (since kidko works under Xubuntu).

 title : The testbutler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TestButler is a Django-Based test case tracking and organizational tool.  </p>

<p>Rationale: In a normal software testing environment, test engineering teams have some amount of collateral (test specifications/plans, test cases, etc) they must generate as part of an over-arching testing strategy for a product. Sometimes they come in the form of test plans, but more often than not, the primary asset is a test case. </p>

<p>TestButler is aimed at making the inventory and tracking/outlines of all of this collateral (plans, specs, test  cases (both manual and automated)) seamless, unified and extensible. </p>

<p>For example, Test cases are the coin of the testing realm. Sometimes they are manual test cases, and other times they are automated test cases. Both manual and automated tests follow the same outline: </p>

<p>Name/ID Description Attributes (functional, smoke, regression) Procedure (an enumerated series of steps for execution)  Expected results If you think in terms of automated test cases, these map to: </p>

<p>suitename.testname testname.doc testname.attribute testname.procedure testname.assertions Fundamentally - there is no logical difference between an outline for a &quot;manual&quot; test case, and an automated one - both have steps to perform, and assertions to make. </p>

<p>In addition to test case management, TestButler will include sub-applications for the rest of the required parts of any good testing organization, including &quot;test run&quot; management, &quot;test plan&quot; outliners, etc. The overarching goal is to make a series of small applications compiled into a &quot;single site&quot; (following the Django Philosophy) to provide test engineering teams with the ability to store, track, organize and communicate all of the assets and knowledge for both automated and manual tests seamlessly. For more, see Philosophy. </p>

<p>Prototype! </p>

<p>Shout out: I have to thank my employer, Blackwave Inc for giving me the time to work on this, and release it to the public. Test Engineering FTW.</p>

 title : The cmediadrivers Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims at developing Windows drivers for C-Media 8738 / 8768 based soundcards, focusing on providing a compact, bloat- and bug-free alternative to the official drivers in order to squeeze the most out of the hardware. The driver is stable and it is successfully used in a large variety of environments. </p>

<p>An inexpensive PCI soundcard with a C-Media chip is required for running this driver. The driver is compatible to Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7. Due to arbitrary driver signing restrictions imposed by Microsoft, the 64 bit versions of Windows Vista and 7 are currently unsupported although there&#39;s a workaround for installing and running the driver. The 64 bit version of XP and the 32 bit versions of 2000, XP, Vista and 7 are however fully supported. </p>

<p>The latest release is 1.2.6 (July 13th 2009).One of the key features is the support for bitperfect lossless digital transmission through S/PDIF, meaning that there is no tampering with the signal whatsoever. This may sound trivial, but almost all consumer grade devices lack such capabilities. In this sense, the driver is specifically designed with audiophile users in mind. </p>

<p>The current version features support for Dolby Digital (AC3)/DTS passthrough, analog multi-channel audio, recording and full mixer control. It comes in both WaveRT (limited to Vista) and non-WaveRT (2000/XP/Vista) flavours. </p>

<p>The source code of the driver is distributed under the terms of the BSD license. If you want to compile the driver from the source code, you need a current version of the Windows Driver Development Kit. The WDK is, however, not required for running the driver. </p>

 title : The cmsmultisite Open Source Project on Open Hub

<p>I&#39;ve looked at a number of different systems (Radiant, Frog, Drupal, Silverstripe, CMS Made Simple, Django sites) but none of them really manage to pull this off (yet). I&#39;ve also had a look at Expression Engine, but although this system has a module for this feature, EE isn&#39;t suited to the applications I want to use it for. </p>

<p>livejournal is god example for it but it will be python (django) with more opportunity for automation </p>

<p>	 I also have a view in order to test how it can be used on several machines and on machines where no mod_python support (remote hosting) </p>

 title : The firefox-media-player Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FireFox Media Player and FireBox JukeboxProblemWhen you click on a link to an MP3 in your browser, it might do many things. It could open up a new page with the QuickTime player inside, it could open up windows media player, it could open VLC. Movies are even more complex. This project aims to merge VLC into FireFox such that every media file encountered would be opened within this extension. </p>

<p>SolutionNo more 3rd party media player applications. Instead, one extension to unify media playback inside of FireFox. Utilizing VLC (mainly) all media in firefox would be handled by the extension. Think of programs like Amarok, iTunes, or winAmp.. When you play media in those, another application does NOT pop open. Instead, they utilize the proper plugins inside of themselves, and play media seamlessly. </p>

<p>Note, this extension would not bother embedded media. Movies like youtube, last.fm, myspace, flash music, etc.. would all be left alone. They player would only be used when firefox tries to reach a URI of a media file directly. </p>

<p>Basic Features-All URIs opened with certain mimetypes or extensions would behave as follows: The page in firefox would remain the same and the extension would be invoked with the link as a parameter. Ability to list all links to media files on a page, much like songbird. One could easily listen too and download said links. Three different UI views: Toolbar, Bottom Bar, and InPage. While toolbar and bottom bar views are pretty intuitive, InPage is different. By inserting a floating iframe right above the link that was clicked (kindof like those rollover adds on blogs) The player would be attached to any given tab. Unile toolbar and bottom bar which are attached to any given windows. Forced and Passive mode. In forced, the firefox media player would play every media file encountered. In passive mode, only files linked to in specific ways would be played in the firefox media player. Maybe something like  For The FutureCreate an iTunes (or Amarok) like interface, all in xhtml/css/javascript, that could be loaded by firefox off of any server. Just like a normal webpage. This would be a fully functional jukebox application, running inside of Gecko. To take this to the next level, the firefox-media-player extension would actually play every file in the jukebox right inside of firefox. No more need for jukebox applications!</p>

 summary : <p>What is Media-Code? </p>

<p>Media-Code is an encrpt program which encrypt plain text to three basic media formats : text, picture, and music files. It is written in python and wxPython.  </p>

<p>Description </p>

<p>There are many powerful encrpyt programs and engines in public release. Even some of them cannot be decrypted by attackers because of their very powerful mathmatical alogorithm. However, they overlooked on essential thing; the best code is the code that doesn&#39;t look like a code at all. This is the basic concept of Media-Code. Encrypt the text into media files, so that people cannot even notice it is a actually a code.  </p>

<p>Object </p>

<p>To develop an ecrytion program which makes a code that does not look like a code. </p>

<p>Requirement </p>

<p>Python 2.5 or above wxPython 2.8 or above</p>

 title : The b1ackjack Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Short IntroductionThe content management system Blackjack was created after seeing so many other content management systems that were just too complicated. &#39;Why should I have this, this, and this in my software when all I need is this?&#39; we asked ourselves. And, just like that, Blackjack started. </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that this software isn&#39;t just for blogging- we plan on making this something you can use to manage your entire website, so flexible you will not once need to use FTP when managing Blackjack, but without all of the baggage that other CMSs may carry. </p>

<p>So what do you have in mind for this?Right now, we have a boxful of feature ideas, but all of these are going to be individually reviewed for practicality, usability, and &#39;Coolosity&#39;. </p>

<p>Any way I can help?Right now, our major focus is on squashing any bugs, which can be done through the issue tracker. Just open a new issue, and we&#39;ll take care of it as soon as we can. </p>

<p>You can also give (or get) help in our Discussion Group, or read the wiki a bit. </p>

<p>Note: The only reason our project name is &#39;b1ackjack&#39; is because the name &#39;blackjack&#39; was taken. No confusion intended. :)</p>
 title : The bearclaw Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThrough the course of my time online, I have found that many of the CMS (Content Management System)&#39;s to be lacking in one way or another. While a broad base of what truly describes a CMS is lacking, I move forward with yet another idea of what that could be. While my idea may be another strand in a big thread of ideas, I think another to get closer to the ideal is beneficial. </p>

<p>Today, we have a rise in blogging platforms, with popular software like Wordpress, Moveable Type, Textpattern and many others. While, they are specific to addressing a certain problem (i.e. Blogging) a comprehensive solution for managing content while maintaining aesthetics has not been implemented. Many homemade and hacked solutions have been done and completed to some degree, however; a program has not been planned out and put into action has not seen full fruition. Today, I hope to rectify this. </p>

<p>BearClaw is a BMS. A BMS (Blog Management System) is a twist on a traditional model. Since the rising the blogging the &#39;news&#39; scripts of the past have had to change and update, by simply using the power and features of a blog model, we can expand and combine with the features and functionality of a CMS to create something &#39;new&#39; and to some degree innovative. While, similar systems have been &#39;made&#39; nothing comprehensive has been mapped out and put together in a full public fashion. This is that effort. </p>

<p>FeaturesThis is simply a list of the basic functionality of the system. The idea however, is to limit it to necessary functions and weed out useless and &#39;flashy&#39; additions. </p>

<p>Blog - Pretty much self explainitory. o Tags - post descriptors, will be hierarchical. 
<br/>o Comments - self explainitory 
<br/>o Syndication - RSS, Atom 
<br/>Pages - The content will be stored on these, it will also be hierarchical with sub-pages. Pagelets - These partial pages will have content that can be used across multiple pages or it will just be a short script or something to be specific for a page. Templates - Custom layouts for pages. o CSS 
<br/>o XHTML 
<br/>o TAL - Tag Attribute Language () - this will be used in conjunction with the templates and even the pagelets to represent certain variables or values, for example in the preceding tag, you see &#39;&#39;, this self closing tag, represents the title of the current page. 
<br/>Plug-ins - used to expand system functionality by building on a current function or creating a new one.  - Feature might not be added or limited in scope. </p>

<p>Project will be coded in PHP5 and use MySQL 4.1+</p>

 summary : <p>This is the base / example client SDK for producers to the Clay Tablet Technologies Translation Platform. </p>

<p>Typical producer systems are content management systems. </p>

<p>Use this as a starting point when building a new producer system client. </p>

<p>See Architecture Overview </p>

<p>In order to properly test and use the client you first need to request an account. Please send account requests to mailto:rcoleman@clay-tablet.com. Please include your name, your company name, and that you require a producer account in the request. </p>

<p>The Client SDK API Documentation can be found in the downloads section. </p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the source and are beginning integration you will want to first drop the source.xml account file we send you into: /src/main/resources/account </p>

<p>The source code is organized similar to a typical Apache project. ./src/main/java/ contains the source for the main application, and ./src/test/java constain the source for the various test classes. Ant is used to compile, test, and can be use to launch the receiver and send some mock test events &amp; files to the platform for processing. </p>

<p>You can retrieve the source code using subversion. For details, please click on the &quot;Source&quot; tab above. </p>

<p>The following are the main points of interest for integration work: </p>

<p>1) Mock Cron - This runs a never ending loop that will call the receiver to check for new platform events and the poller to check for state changes in the connected system (CMS). </p>

<p>2) Mock Receiver - This checks the incoming message queue for new events from the platform and performs whatever work is necessary, like downloading attachments and calling the connection stub (interface to the CMS). </p>

<p>3) Mock State Poller - This checks the connected system via the connection stub for state changes in the CMS, and sends important update events and files to the platform queue. </p>

<p>4) Mock Stub - This is the interface to the connected system (CMS). </p>

<p>5) Mock Module - Guice DI configuration module. Same idea as a Spring applicationContext.xml. </p>

<p>If you need to build a custom client in a language other than Java please see: Building a Custom Client</p>

 title : The cmfit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cmfit(ContentManagement - Flatfile,Injection and Templatedriven)For editing, cmfit injects html forms into html files (templates) by replacing keywords(tags) in each template, and for viewing, the tags are replaced with the resulting content. Content and templates are stored in separate files.  </p>

<p>Design principlesHTML pages can be fully designed separately from cmfit, the content reference keywords should not break layout (content loops does at the moment, but will not later on). No database. As all files are stored as flat files generated on content changes, there is no dependeny on any database nor to cmfit itself for your site to be up. Migration - If you ever need to move the site, you have flat html-files that you can use, or you can parse the content files and insert it into your more fancy cms.</p>

 summary : <p>cmServletIntroductionThis is a context management service with Ajax and Servlet technology. The final product will very similar to friendster and facebook, but second hand shopping function will be added and will be in Chinese as base </p>

<p>DetailsA content management system (CMS) is computer software used to create, edit, manage, and publish content in a consistently-organized fashion. CMSs are frequently used for storing, controlling, versioning, and publishing industry-specific documentation such as news articles, operators&#39; manuals, technical manuals, sales guides, and marketing brochures. The content managed may include computer files, image media, audio files, electronic documents, and Web content. </p>

<p>A CMS may support the following features: </p>

<p>identification of all key users and their content management roles; the ability to assign roles and responsibilities to different content categories or types; definition of workflow tasks for collaborative creation, often coupled with event messaging so that content managers are alerted to changes in content (For example, a content creator submits a story, which is published only after the copy editor revises it and the editor-in-chief approves it.); the ability to track and manage multiple versions of a single instance of content; the ability to publish the content to a repository to support access to the content (Increasingly, the repository is an inherent part of the system, and incorporates enterprise search and retrieval.); separation of content&#39;s semantic layer from its layout  Initial idea of this CMS include:photo upload friend maker Blog Buy/Sell second hand stuff extendable After all function has finished, a Flex interface will used instead of html </p>

 title : The collegecms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>College CMS (for lack of a better idea for the name) will be a content management system targeted on colleges.  I have found that the colleges I&#39;ve been to lack a quality system as such.  SCMS should have have a top level consisting of departments and branch into courses and instructors.  What I&#39;m looking to create is something that feels similar to what Facebook has done with its user interface.  I&#39;ve started a similar project on my own that using .NET but I think I would rather have it written with an AJAX front end and maybe a MySQL database.  Something that can be easily installed by a school&#39;s IT department and easily managed by the school&#39;s administration, instructors, and students.  There are many features I&#39;d like to have in CCMS, but this description doesn&#39;t have nearly enough space for me to describe them all.  I will upload a document better outlining what I am looking for and anyone interested is welcome to help me.  This would be my first large project and I would love to have some experienced programmers on board to help me out.</p>

 title : The contentframework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal behind ContentFramework is to make it really easy add &amp; update content for websites created using Java &amp; Spring.</p>

<p>You initialize some beans in the Spring Configuration, load the tag lib declaration, and start dropping tags in your JSP files.  When a tag is encountered, the content referenced by the tag is pulled from a datasource (MySQL, flatfiles, whatever) and dropped into the webpage.  To edit the content, just log in as an administrator (often using a special admin login form which sets a session attribute) and click the &#39;edit&#39; button next to the content you want to modify.  Provided everything is configured correctly in Spring, a fancy edit window (using FCKEditor or a plain textarea box) opens which allows you to modify the site.</p>

<p>The project was created to make it easy for someone other than the developer to update site content for i18n sites without having to modify property files / message bundles.</p>

 title : The dicon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>dicon is a web based digital content management application that makes use of folksonomy to categorize its contents.</p>

<p>The project goal is above all else to take a minimalistic approach to the problem of storing and managing digital content.</p>

<p>To begin with, the project will focus on multimedia content, or more specifically, images. From there it will move on to widen its horizon, providing support for audio and video and perhaps other types of digital content.</p>

<p>dicon is not a web album, it&#39;s not a content management system either in the common sense of that term.</p>

<p>The main usability goals of dicon are:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Take a minimalistic approach. Strive to make things simple.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Use folksonomy for categorization.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Use &#39;virtual collections&#39; instead of the more traditional &#39;folder/directory structure&#39; approach.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Be cute!</p>

<p>The main design goals of dicon are:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Take a minimalistic approach. Less is more.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Be &#39;pluggable&#39;. Have the ability to add new digital content types by implementing plugins.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Automation. Categorize content as much as possible when it is imported. Sort by content type and extract metadata for sorting if possible.</p>

 title : The flatpackcms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionFlatPackCMS is a lightweight CMS designed for general purpose use. FlatPackCMS uses a unique modular coding system which allows huge flexibility and on-demand changes of the entire display engine. Want a blog? Just use a blog module. Need a snazzy business website? Just use one of our many templates to create a professional looking website in seconds, or build your own using FlatPackCMS&#39;s unique templating system that allows you to build your own templates in minutes! Are you a developer wanting to make your own CMS? Why not edit our well documented code to make you own without having to design the difficult back-end? The huge potential for code modifying does not make FlatPackCMS hard to use however, it can be run entirely with a zero-knowledge point and click installation right from your web browser! </p>

<p>RequirementsA web server such as Apache with PHP5 and MySQL4 installed. </p>

<p>InstallationWARNING - FlatPackCMS is currently not at a release stage so you are are advised to not install it on your web server unless you know what you are doing. We will take no responsibility to any damage that happens to your web server by you installing FlatPackCMS on it. </p>

<p>ManualDownload a database dump and use it to create the database required for FlatPackCMS. Download the source code and extract the contents of the compressed archive to a directory on your web server. Edit config.php to suit your needs, and change engine_db_mysql_base to the correct settings for your database. Finally point your web browser to the directory where you have installed FlatPackCMS. If all goes accordingly, then you should be presented with a page of example content. </p>

<p>About FlatPackCMSIn summer 2007, Henry Schwar noticed the lack of simple (to-the-point unbloated) content management systems available. He set about designing a CMS for personal use, with none of the bulky and useless bells and whistles of that of larger CMS&#39;s such as Druapl or Joomla. It was written to be a basic CMS; no gallery, no permission system, no syndication, no frameworks - just pure content management for website building. Ross Brown joined the project in mid April 08 with his work with the automatic installer(now abandoned due to continuous changes of code), and set about removing the source of flat-file content, and replacing it with database driven content. The project was open-sourced as a BETA product officially on the 25th April 08.</p>

<p>AboutThe Hotaru Project is a collection of plugins for Plume CMS.  </p>

<p>For a starter, what is Plume CMS ? </p>

<p>Plume CMS is a fully functional Content Management System in PHP on top of MySQL.  
<br/>Including articles, news, file management and all of the general functionalities of a CMS. 
<br/>It is completely accessible and very easy to use on a daily basis.  
<br/>- from the Plume CMS Project Homepage </p>

<p>Being the useful tool it is, Plume may lack some features ; but fear not ! The CMS is quite flexible and therefore can be easily extended. This is precisely the aim of Hotaru : grouping a bunch of plugins specifically adapted and/or developed for Plume. </p>

<p>OverviewAs I&#39;ve just begun this project, the collection is not that big. For the time being, you&#39;ll find : </p>

<p>featherBox, which is a port of one among many Lightbox script (created by Loresh Dhakar - licensed under CC-BY-v2.5 the last time I checked), Lightbox 2.3 plugin for Wordpress by Rupert Morris (licensed under the GNU/GPL). Therefore, it is dual-licensed under the CC-BY-v2.5 AND GNU/GPL. SimplePie, which is a port of the famous and eponymous PHP class that provides an easy way to read/include into your site syndication feeds. It is licensed under the LGPL. News and Updates2007-06-28, 12.37am :  It is the end of the unsettled time as I started to work on the featherBox. I&#39;ve finally decided to abandon the Lightbox basis for Thickbox, a JQuery based script. As far as I have played with it, this change is for the better : less files, less images, more features... I&#39;ll update the documentation and probably build a demo site before doing any release. However, the trunk has been updated with this 1.1-release to be. On another note, I&#39;ve read that SimplePie 1.0RC had been released a few days ago. I shall update the plugin soon then. FrançaisÀ ProposLe Projet Hotaru est une collection de plugins pour Plume CMS. </p>

<p>Mais, avant toute chose, qu&#39;est-ce que Plume CMS ? </p>

<p>Plume CMS est une Système de Gestion de Contenu (ndlr: ou Content Management System, ou CMS) tout à fait fonctionnel développé avec PHP/MySQL. 
<br/>Comprenant notamment la gestion d&#39;articles, de brèves et de fichiers, Plume CMS a toutes les fonctionnalités générales d&#39;un CMS. 
<br/>Il est entièrement accessible et est, de plus, très aisément utilisable au quotidien. 
<br/>- citation du site du projet Plume CMS, traduction par les soins de votre humble serviteur. </p>

<p>Etant cet outil bien utile, Plume CMS manque toutefois de quelques fonctions ; mais n&#39;ayons crainte ! Ce CMS fait preuve d&#39;une grande flexibilité et peut donc être facilement étendu. Et c&#39;est précisément l&#39;objectif de Hotaru : regrouper des plugins spécifiquement adapté et/ou développé pour Plume. </p>

<p>AperçuDans la mesure où je viens juste de mettre en route ce projet, dans de telles &quot;proportions&quot; ; la collection ne croule pas franchement sous la diversité. Pour le moment, vous pourrez trouver : </p>

<p>featherBox : C&#39;est un port d&#39;un script de Lightbox (créé par Loresh Dhakar - sous licence CC-BY-v2.5 la dernière fois que j&#39;ai vérifié), une version parmi tant d&#39;autres : celle de  Rupert Morris, Lightbox 2.3 plugin for Wordpress (sous licence GNU/GPL). Ainsi donc, ce plugin bénéficie de la double licence CC-BY-v2.5 ET GNU/GPL. SimplePie : C&#39;est un port de la fameuse, et éponyme, classe PHP permettant l&#39;intégration simple de flux de syndication à des sites. Ce plugin, tout comme sa source originale, bénéficie des bienfaits de la licence LGPL. Les dernières nouvelles2007-06-28, 12.37am :  C&#39;est la fin de la période d&#39;indécision dans la mesure où je recommence à travailler sur featherBox. Je me suis finalement décidée à abandonner la base de Lightbox au profit de Thickbox, un script basé sur JQuery. De ce que j&#39;ai pu constater après avoir jouer avec, c&#39;est que ce changement est clairement pour le meilleur : moins de fichiers, moins d&#39;images, plus de fonctionnalités... Je ferais une mise à jour de la documentation et probablement construirait un petit site de démonstration avant de sortir la nouvelle version. Néanmoins, le trunk a été mis à jour avec cette future v1.1. Sur un tout autre sujet, j&#39;ai lu que SimplePie 1.0RC était sortie il y a quelques jours. Je ferais bientôt la mise à jour qui s&#39;impose.</p>

 summary : <p>Project renamed..follow this project on https://code.google.com/p/joack/Ibento is a Content Management System (CMS) that is a computer software used to create, edit, manage, and publish content in a consistently organized fashion. IBento can be used for storing, controlling, versioning, and publishing industry-specific documentation such as news articles, operators&#39; manuals, technical manuals, sales guides, and marketing brochures. The content managed include computer files, image media, audio files, video files, electronic documents, and Web content. </p>

<p>IBento support the following features: </p>

<p>identification of all key users and their content management roles; the ability to assign roles and responsibilities to different content categories or types; definition of workflow tasks for collaborative creation, often coupled with event messaging so that content managers are alerted to changes in content (For example, a content creator submits a story, which is published only after the copy editor revises it and the editor-in-chief approves it.); the ability to track and manage multiple versions of a single instance of content; the ability to publish the content to a repository to support access to the content (Increasingly, the repository is an inherent part of the system, and incorporates enterprise search and retrieval.); separation of content&#39;s semantic layer from its layout (For example, the CMS may automatically set the color, fonts, or emphasis of text.); the ability to install plugins and extension modules; the ability to manage multiple layout templates and to switch them in every moment.

 title : The moreia-cbm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Moreia is meant to be used for programmers directly, not for end users. It provides the wheel at a state-of-art technology including PHPTAL, easiest workflow manager as possible (to be implemented), sqlite, multi-linguage featured as self content and frontend content. </p>

<p>Moreia uses PHPTAL itself but the programmer can implement another template engine, same with workflow. But the main idea it’s to offer the capability to create different backend tool, administration tools with different layout and designs, at the same time dispose objects that will be handy to create the frontends. This why Moreia must be simple and nothing too complex should be applied to the project, if so, we would create something like Moreia light and Professional as wish. </p>

<p>“Coral” will be the main example to how implement Moreia, but it is not meant to be used as base reference for any web page. This is like this…. Moreia lives inside the Corals, no problem actually; we could call each Moreia frontend as a Coral. </p>

<p>Moreia is based my experiences with Zope/Silva and Zope/Plone, with propose of simplicity and, I may say, with my limits as Programmer, I had this intention to create something easy to implement the very basic without taking of the programmer work. In other words, with Moreia and Coral everybody has the job, the designers with Coral and Programmers with Moreia and for sure, the target clients are small companies, small-medium home pages that need multi-language features. </p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated and at this moment it’s even necessary. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot! </p>

It boasts quick and simple setup, as it doesn&#39;t use any MySQL (or any other databases). Planet Mongo focuses on websites such as web fliers, personal home pages and weblogs, band pages, and other such websites for which large content managers would introduce more problems than they would solve. </p>

<p>Everything done automatically by Planet Mongo can be done (or undone) conveniently by hand. All configuration can be done by editing files. Themes are created using an easy template system. </p>

<p>The key to Planet Mongo&#39;s power lies in its ultra-versatile command system, in which the user can embed Planet Mongo modules anywhere, and thereby construct your website programmatic ally using large building blocks. </p>

 summary : <p>Content management systems such as Plone provide a rich set of services.  How much of that could be taken into an offline client for content management and design? </p>

<p>This project looks at using Firefox (specifically XULRunner) to create an offline client for one or more sites.  Also in scope is a &quot;studio&quot; type environment for defining content types and creating themes. As such, it is inspired by Notes and Groove. </p>

<p>Implicit in this is investigation into new ideas: bringing a WSGI/Paster approach to POW, looking at WebForms2, and changes on the server side.</p>

 title : The shoehorn Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>shoehornA very basic script management system that looks up URLs in a database then pulls in PHP scripts and other files based on what is found in the database.  The features will include expiration dates of scripts, release-dates, and the ability to manage permissions with a separate authentication class. </p>

<p>Created out of a need for a custom intranet, knowing that new scripts would need to be added on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Can be used for html content management, but is more ideal for php scripts. </p>

<p>For more details, check out our initial goals </p>

<p>Current StatusBase source is available! </p>

<p>Just the overall structure of the classes with a little bit of error handling and a TON of  Active Directory authentication stuff, including getting string SID and GUIDs for users and groups they are a member of, searching multiple base DNs! </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty stoked about that! </p>

<p>Now I just need to figure out how to make secure connections to my AD Domain Controller, but that has nothing to do with the shoehorn project, other than maybe the addition of a secure ldap authentication class.</p>

 title : The velocitycms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Velocity Content Management SystemAn open source CMS (content management system) written for .netVelocity is an open source Content Management System Base on the .net MVC framework. Velocity CMS travels light and relies on the concept of self governed components. Velocity CMS also provide a service layer that integrates with current websites that want to manage content more effectively. </p>

<p>Why VelocityThe concept of how velocity would work came about when evaluating several CMS systems. Although we feel there are many great CMS systems out there (wiki, drupal) several have fallen into massive web application pitfall. More so in the .net realm. The Domain for many of these systems become caught up in rendering for the GUI. Thus we have several massive systems that focus more on providing content that is GUI specific. Instead of doing what they were meant to at first, delivering flexible and manageable content. When looking for a system that was easily customizable for several requirements the Velocity CMS method became real.    </p>

<p>How Velocity WorksVelocity works from the stance that all content can be broken down into small digestible pieces. Those pieces have tight relationships but are still structured the same no matter what the content. The assembly of the content into a presentable format happens late. GUI components are responsible for the assembly and dis-assembly of the presentation format and fitting the content back into the original Domain. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Understanding the DomainAll of the content for Velocity is broken down into two main pieces.  </p>

<p>ContentGroups and ContentElements A ContentGroup contains many ContentElements and many ContentGroups A ContentElement contains data available for content. It also contains not related reference data for the purpose of many to may relationships. A ContentElement cannot exist without a ContentGroup  A ContentGroup can exist without a ContentElement   </p>

 summary : <p>Workspace@ Engine - New generation of intelligent content management systemW@E is new CMS system, built on my past work with other CMS systems. On this project I&#39;m working for now over 1 year. ( Documentation, design and rest of things take me over 9 months. ) With this system, I&#39;m trying to eliminate all things that I consider &quot;it can be better&quot; + with a few ( approx. 80 ) new things which I didn&#39;t saw on net for now ( or I&#39;m blind lol ). That 80 things you&#39;ll not be able to see until I finish this CMS.  </p>

<p>Notice - unfortunately :/Unfortunately, it&#39;s under development and my strong suggestion is to forget on downloading any svn revisions until you see that this description is different! Currently you can&#39;t see anything what&#39;s good or that it&#39;s working properly + it&#39;s working only on FF3. Safari as IE got some bugs and they will be fixed in next 10-15 (07/26/08) days. </p>

<p>If you see that kinda it&#39;s slow.... Well please go in pc store for some dual core... My suggestion Intel 3.0 Ghz... Just joking! It will be slower for users with bad pc. I can&#39;t  fix that. Sorry. </p>

<p>VersionCurrent version is: Alpha 0.1.2 </p>

<p>DeadlineI&#39;m setting up deadline for beta 1.0 to 11/01/2008. If anything goes wrong I&#39;ll change date and say why I did that. </p>

You can always send me mail but please if you re sending email for joining, say what you are, from where u re from, give me links to ur websites ( portfolio ).

 summary : <p>IntroductionBXMPP is an effort for making XMPP less verbose. Since everybody knows that XML is extremely inefficient in terms of bandwidth, the XSF has defined a new transport, named Binary XMPP, for tackling this critical problem by devising a highly compressible binary transport for XMPP. See the official XEP for a more detailed description. </p>

<p>InstallationNow you can finally try an efficient Binary XMPP client on your cell phone, just follow these instructions: </p>

<p>Download the installer for Lampiro BXMPP Edition and send it to your phone Checkout the BXMPP connection manager (Python and Twisted Matrix required) from the SVN repository Start the connection manager  python bxmpp_cm.py jabberhost  
<br/>Start the client on your cell phone, go to the advanced options and manually set the connection host to yourcmhost:10110 And finally enjoy the highly compressible binary stream made of </p>

<p> and  elements! </p>

<p>NotesPlease note the current version of Lampiro has compression turned off. The next release will be available in two versions, a free one with just the optimized Binary XMPP, and a pro version offering you all the advantages of a binary protocol and compression! </p>

<p>ExamplesHere is a partial stream dump. Our laboratories have demonstrated that the stream is compressible to less than 2% of the original size!</p>

 title : The jabberlife Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JabberLife allows you to control a Second Life avatar remotely by sending instant messages using the Jabber or XMPP protocol. </p>

<p>As the basis it uses the code of the TestClient from libsecondlife, which means most of the functionality of the TestClient is available. </p>

<p>JabberLife has 2 basic modes of operation. - The first is command mode. In this mode the message send to the bot cosists of a TestClient command. - The second mode is IM mode, which was the main purpose of this project. In this mode messages are treated as IM&#39;s to a predefined avatar. Switching avatars to talk to is also possible in this mode. </p>

<p>General chat is optionally possible but not recommended in areas with lots of avatars, especially when controling the bot with a jabber client on a mobile phone. ;-) </p>

 title : The pep-in-muc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PEP in MUC: An Openfire PluginOverviewOpenfire plugin allowing users local to the server to explicitly broadcast their Personal Eventing information to a Multi-User Chat room via a command sent to the MUC room. </p>

<p>For example, if local user VinniePaz is in a MUC room and wishes to share what he is listening to with the other occupants in the room, he can send a message to the room with body &quot;/tune&quot; which will cause the server to lookup his User Tune PEP node and share its payload with the other room occupants in an action format. </p>

<p>(eg. VinniePaz is listening to Jedi Mind Tricks - Blood Runs Cold - Violent By Design) </p>

<p>The plugin aims to support all known PEP data formats, triggered by their node names in the form of a command. So if the user wishes to broadcast his &#39;mood&#39; PEP node, he could send a message to the room with body &quot;/mood&quot;. </p>

<p>RequirementsYou need to be using a version of Openfire greater than 3.5.1 (so currently, from svn trunk). </p>

<p>However, if you do not want to build from trunk and you cannot wait for the next Openfire release, you can download a patched openfire.jar lib file for version 3.5.1 and copy it over your old openfire.jar in the openfire/lib/ directory. </p>

<p>InstallationCopy pepInMuc.jar into the plugins directory of your Openfire installation. The plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version, copy the new pepInMuc.jar file over the existing file. </p>

<p>Using the PluginAs a local user, join a MUC room. Send a message to the room with body &quot;/</p>

<p>&quot; where  is the name of a PEP node the plugin supports. </p>

<p>Currently, the plugin supports the following PEP node types: </p>

 title : The psi-jft Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The objective is to implement the File Transfer system as a media session for Jingle since the manner in which p2p connections are established (even with Firewalls and NAT devices  involved) is one of the main reasons for its success and also makes it relatively easy to implement any kind of media session.</p>

<p>Expecting to achieve an efficient file transfer system, mainly for users behind Firewall/NAT that currently transfer files through a server which causes low transfer rates.</p>

 title : The tunecore-announcer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Communicate with your servers and daemons using the XMPP (aka Jabber) protocol.  This is ideal for virtual instances where you have servers coming online based on workload.  A server or process can register with your XMPP server when it comes online and add you to it&#39;s roster.  You can then send it control messages using your favorite Jabber client (iChat, Adium, etc).  </p>

<p>A useful place to use this program is in an cloud environment where you have transient server instances starting and stopping based on workload.  At TuneCore we do a lot of media transcoding in the Amazon EC2 cloud and we need to keep track of our virtual instances.  We created the TunecoreAnnouncer to help us with that. </p>

<p>To install it: </p>

<p>sudo gem install tunecore-announcerTo run it: </p>

<p>announcer --jabber-server=jabber.yourdomain.com \
<br/>--name=worker \
<br/>--password=any_password \

O objetivo da pesquisa é refletir sobre questões metodológicas relativas aos estudos de processos de criação,  utilizando o desenho (representação gráfico-visual), mais especificamente, o diagrama como representação de  processos. Diagramas dinâmicos propostos são produtos da elaboração cognitiva assim como meio para engendrar  o acesso e a assimilação do conhecimento, o que Bonsiepe define como metabolismo cognoscitivo.  São linhas distintas as teorias articuladas para apoiar o desenvolvimento desta pesquisa, contudo a rede  tecida encontra-se num espaço comum, num ambiente onde teóricos concertam questões do signo e significação  em coerência com pensamento de Charles S. Peirce.  São três as linhas principais: a Teoria Geral dos Sistemas, como sistematizada por Bunge e Jorge Vieira, de  onde se ajusta conceitos e metodologias à segunda linha, a Crítica Genética, mais especificamente a Crítica de  Processo como denominada por Cecilia Salles e que tem interesse na busca por princípios gerais dos processos  de criação. A terceira insere-se no domínio da arquitetura da informação, ou seja, refere-se aos problemas  relacionados à sistematização de dados e informação, própria à comunicação e transmissão de conhecimento.  Autores como Lucrécia Ferrara, Gui Bonsiepe, Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, entre outros serão considerados como  fios constituidores desta última linha.  Justificados e ajustados ao pensamento do espaço enquanto campo de construção de significado,  engendrado por Ferrara, adota-se como objeto a ser conhecido o processo de constituição de um ‘tipo’ na  arquitetura.  Objeto próprio a uma cultura, o ‘tipo’ é entendido muito mais como princípios gerais de formação,  do que um modelo a ser seguido. Portanto um campo comum, um espaço ideal adequado à construção de  sentido. Com efeito, entender o movimento de formação e transformação do ‘tipo’ é domínio de estudos da  Crítica de Processo. O objeto escolhido, dado sua escala cultural e temporal, será analisado a partir de indivíduos  produzidos entre 1930 a 1975.  Ao fim, conclui-se o desenvolvimento de um sistema gerador de diagramas dinâmicos que opera com a  lógica evolutiva encontrada no objeto estudado. Desta forma, tem-se como resultado da pesquisa uma ferramenta  que auxilie os estudos em Crítica de Processo, assim como a possibilidade de especular sobre formação de  imagens futuras.</p>

 summary : <p>A Java desktop application (J2SE 5+Swing Application Framework) for automatic classification of documents against a given training set. It has been developed, and is packaged, as a Netbeans project. It uses the stemmers created with Snowball (http://snowball.tartarus.org, released under the BSD license) for text pre-processing, TF-IDF or the Bhattacharrya distance to rank the documents of the training set to the query document, and the K-NN algorithm to classify it. As of now, it only supports the classification of news from the ANSA website (http://www.ansa.it - The Italian main news agency), but the program has a modular architecture, that allows it to be extended by writing plugins for scraping the content of other websites, or other types of documents (PDF, DOC, ODT, etc...).</p>

 title : The dramatizer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Dramatizer produces a series of scripts that will be helpful to the director  and recordist  in making an audio dramatized version of a portion of the Bible. Dramatizer produces a master script for human use and also a master script for the computer to use. Dramatizer produces a script for each speaker (voice talent) with just his/her clips. Dramatizer links to Cool Edit or Audacity or Audition or your audio recording program  with the proper wave  file to record for a particular clip. Recordings can be done in sequence or out of sequence (by speaker number) or a combination of these. Dramatizer helps organize the hundreds or thousands of wave files created. The interface can be localized. French and Portuguese are currently available. Note: be sure to uninstall older versions of Dramatizer before installing a newer version. Your work will remain. Just the program and related files are uninstalled. </p>

<p>Be sure to email jim_albright@wycliffe.org that you are trying out Dramatizer. I want to know that it works or has problems. It is production ready now. The menus are able to be modified into other languages now. Please send me the modified localization.txt file. It is located where you installed Dramatizer in a folder called requiredFiles. I will include your language in the next distribution.  </p>

<p>Note: If novices are going to install the Dramatizer, it might be helpful if they understood that these steps are involved: </p>

<p>They will probably need to install .NET Framework.  When they try to install Dramatizer, Windows will ask if it is OK to install .NET Framework A page will come up with many choices. Choose: .NET Framework 3.5 Runtime (or later) You then have to click on the installation option again. Go to Start and run the program. </p>

<p>Please add any feature requests or bug notifications on the &quot;Issues&quot; page. </p>

<p>If you want to see how to localize Dramatizer you can import the localization.txt file into a spread sheet. </p>

<p>If the program freezes while processing your data, the first place to look is to make sure you have matching quote marks. Every open quote mark must have a matching close mark.  </p>

 title : The gibberizer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GibberizerGibberizer is a tool for creating familiar-sounding gibberish.  You enter some text, and Gibberizer generates gibberish that is lexically similar to the text you entered. </p>

<p>Gibberish means that the generated text will be, to some extent, weird.  Depending on your settings, the generated text will consist mostly of words and phrases that do not appear in your text. Similar means that the gibberish will be somewhat familiar-sounding, generally pronounceable, and perhaps nearly meaningful. You can adjust the degree of similarity or weirdness you want in the gibberish. UsesWhy would you want familiar-sounding gibberish? </p>

<p>To create names for fictional people, places, and things.  Many of the generated names will be unusual-but-plausible, and will seem to come more or less from the same culture as the given names. Come on, admit it: gibberish is fun!  Paste something you or a friend have written into the input box, set the familiarity to 7 or so, and glick the Gibberize button to create a weird variation.  Or enter 20 friends and family names, set the familiarity to 3 or 4, and Gibberize to invent similar names. DocumentationThe Gibberizer User Guide briefly describes the knobs and buttons you can tweak to bend Gibberizer to your will. The Gibberizer Wiki (a work in progress) describes some of the technical ideas behind Gibberizer. Ways to Play describes settings for a few specific uses of Gibberizer.

 title : The indostemmer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Indostemmer is C# Indonesian Stemming algorithm that use to transform a word into it basic form. In researches about Text Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge Data Discovery and about text in general, the task of processing derivative word into stem word is very important, because processing non-stem word can cause mistakes and deviations in the result. In this research, the stemming process is done by a stemmer made based on a rulested in the form of an XML (Extensible Markup Language) file in hope that the ruleset is easily customized. The stemmer itself is a parser using the FSA (Finite State Automata) principle, due to the fact that Indonesian language structure might contain double prefix or suffix. There are three evaluations done in this research. The first evaluation results in 84.33 % accuracy from 25269 words being tested. The second evaluation is an improvement from the first evaluation especially on the ruleset structures, resulting in 87.22% accuracy. The third evaluation is focused on adding information into the ruleset,resulting in 90.25% accuracy from 25269 words being tested.</p>

 title : The mm2notes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Does some XML foo to get meeting notes out of your MM file.  FreeMind is great for taking notes very quickly and is highly recommended.  I sometimes project FreeMind on the overhead projector so that everyone can see the notes I&#39;m taking.  The zoom feature (Alt-Down) is very handy so that it isn&#39;t too small. </p>

<p>After the meeting you might check-in the .mm file into a source control program (if you are into that kind of thing) and then clean up the notes so that it makes more sense and only the salient points are kept.  Then your run something like: </p>

<p>mm2notes WeeklyMeeting.mm -o WeeklyMeeting.htmlTo output the notes in HTML, which you can copy and paste to a variety of places. </p>

<p>Screen ShotsIn FreeMind your notes will look something like this: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After running mm2notes on your .mm file the HTML will look like like: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FeaturesAttendees can be just a list, at list with e-mails under the person&#39;s name (very handy) or a list of cities with the list of people in each city below. </p>

<p>Because FreeMind keeps track of all the times that nodes are created I used that time to organize the meeting minutes.  So even though you may freely jump around adding notes under different people or headings, it&#39;ll still organize it by time, so it still makes some sense. </p>

 title : The python-callbacks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A library for creating and running callbacks and closures in Python. </p>

<p>Python documentation: </p>

<p>http://python-callbacks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/callbacks.html 
<br/>View source: </p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/python-callbacks/source/browse/trunk/callbacks.py 
<br/>Features include: </p>

<p>Scopes: Callbacks can be registered in instance, class, module or 
<br/>global scope. 
<br/>Priority levels: Callbacks can be given a priority, where higher 
<br/>priority callbacks will be run before lower priority callbacks. 
<br/>Automatic requeuing: Callbacks can be marked as &#39;permanent&#39; to be 
<br/>requeued automatically after being executed. 
<br/>Callback chaining: Callbacks can be chained such that the result of 
<br/>the previous callback is used as the input for the next callback. 
<br/>Genericity: Any callable object (a Callback instance, a function, a 
<br/>anonymous lambda function, or a class-based closure) can be used as 
<br/>a callback. 
<br/>Iterators: Callbacks can be invoked automatically via 
<br/>RunAllCallbacks and RunCallbackChain, or iterated over manually with 
<br/>CallbackIterator and CopyFirstCallbackIterator. 
<br/>Overview: </p>

<p>A callback is callable code that can be registered and executed at 
<br/>some point in the future in a different context.  The callback 
<br/>pattern allows a library to handle arbitrary clients without knowing 
<br/>in advance what they will be. 
<br/>The callback registration mechanism that allows client code to tell 
<br/>a class or module about a method that should be executed at a point 
<br/>in time in the future. 
<br/>The library is used by two distinct groups: classes or modules that 
<br/>wish to register and execute callbacks, and clients that wish to 
<br/>register their code to be called back. 
<br/>Classes or modules that register and run callbacks should first 
<br/>write a wrapper function around the RegisterCallback method.  This 
<br/>method will be invoked by other classes and code that want to be 
<br/>called back at some point in the future.  E.g.: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from callbacks import RegisterCallback, RunAllCallbacks
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; class CallbackHost(object):
<br/>...   def RegisterSomeCallback(self, callback):
<br/>...     &#39;&#39;&#39;Registers the callback to be invoked by RunAllCallbacks.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...     RegisterCallback(self, &#39;some callback&#39;, callback)
<br/>...
<br/>...   def RunTheCallbacks(self):
<br/>...     &#39;&#39;&#39;Returns the results (in a list) of  each registed callback.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...     return RunAllCallbacks(self, &#39;some callback&#39;)To use the registration methods, clients will provide a callback 
<br/>method in the form of a function, an anonymous lambda function, a 
<br/>class-based callable closure, or a Callback, PermanentCallback, or 
<br/>TemporaryCallback (or subclass) instance. 
<br/>After the callbacks have been registered, the class can run all of the 
<br/>registed callbacks automatically by executing the RunAllCallbacks 
<br/>method.  E.g.: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from callbacks import PermanentCallback, Callback</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; def MyCallback():
<br/>...   return &#39;MyCallback&#39;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; host = CallbackHost()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; callback = PermanentCallback(MyCallback)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RegisterSomeCallback(callback)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RunTheCallbacks()
<br/>[&#39;MyCallback&#39;]Class-based closures can also be registered: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClosure(object):
<br/>...   def __init__(self, string):
<br/>...      self.string = string
<br/>...   def __call__(self):
<br/>...      return self.string</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; callback = PermanentCallback(MyClosure(&#39;MyClosure&#39;))
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RegisterSomeCallback(callback)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RunTheCallbacks()
<br/>[&#39;MyCallback&#39;, &#39;MyClosure&#39;]As can higher-priority callbacks: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; callback = PermanentCallback(MyClosure(&#39;High priority&#39;), priority=10)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RegisterSomeCallback(callback)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RunTheCallbacks()
<br/>[&#39;High priority&#39;, &#39;MyCallback&#39;, &#39;MyClosure&#39;]By default, callbacks expire after being run once: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; callback = Callback(MyClosure(&#39;Run once&#39;))
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RegisterSomeCallback(callback)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RunTheCallbacks()
<br/>[&#39;High priority&#39;, &#39;MyCallback&#39;, &#39;MyClosure&#39;, &#39;Run once&#39;]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; host.RunTheCallbacks()
<br/>[&#39;High priority&#39;, &#39;MyCallback&#39;, &#39;MyClosure&#39;]Another Example:    </p>

<p>Imagine a TextProcessor class that is used to modify text.  The 
<br/>TextProcessor wants to allow callers to provide their own text 
<br/>processing routines, and does so via a RegisterProcessor method. 
<br/>When the Process method is invoked, so are the registered text 
<br/>processors. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import callbacks</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; class TextProcessor(object):
<br/>...   &#39;&#39;&#39;A class that modifies text according to registered callbacks.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...
<br/>...   def RegisterProcessor(self, callback):
<br/>...     &#39;&#39;&#39;Registers a callback to be invoked when the text.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...     callbacks.RegisterCallback(self, &#39;process&#39;, callback)
<br/>...
<br/>...   def Process(self, text):
<br/>...     &#39;&#39;&#39;Runs all of the registered callbacks to process the text.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...     return callbacks.RunCallbackChain(self, &#39;process&#39;, text)In the client: 
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; def Capitalize(text):
<br/>...   &#39;&#39;&#39;Returns the text with the first character capitalized.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...   return text.capitalize()</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; def CompactWhitespace(text):
<br/>...   &#39;&#39;&#39;Returns the text with successive whitespace characters collapsed.&#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>...   return re.sub(&#39;\\s+&#39;, &#39; &#39;, text)     </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; processor = TextProcessor()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; processor.RegisterProcessor(Capitalize)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; processor.RegisterProcessor(CompactWhitespace)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; processor.Process(&#39;four  score and  seven  years    ago...&#39;)
<br/>&#39;Four score and seven years ago...&#39;Limitations and TODOs: </p>

<p>Function signatures are not validated.  Helper code could be written 
<br/>to match callback signatures against a function specification or 
<br/>against a reference function. 
<br/>Exceptions raised by callbacks are not handled automatically yet. 
<br/>Automatic registration and execution wrappers could be created to 
<br/>simplify the one-line boilerplate functions.</p>

 title : The pytwerp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The whole concept of Twerp is to allow your Twitter (or Laconi.ca) data stream to be pulled, formatted via a template you can control and then output to the console. </p>

<p>It also allows you to post a status message or send a direct message. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it in a nutshell. </p>

<p>You can access the following data streams: </p>

<p>Friends Timeline Your Timeline Your Replies Direct Messages sent to you Options: </p>

<p>    -c  --config      Location of the configuration file.
<br/>                                The default file ~/.twerp.cfg is created
<br/>                                and populated the first time you run Twerp.
<br/>    -U  --username        User ID - needed only the first time
<br/>                                you run Twerp as Twerp will save the value.
<br/>    -P  --password    Account Password - also only needed once.
<br/>    -T  --template        Template string.  This string is used to
<br/>                                format the data received from Twitter.
<br/>                                Details on the format can be found below.
<br/>    -d  --direct       Send a direct message.
<br/>    -t  --timeline              Twerp will ouput your timeline.
<br/>    -f  --friends               Twerp will output your friend&#39;s timeline.
<br/>    -r  --replies               Twerp will output replies to you.
<br/>    -p  --public                Twerp will output the public timeline.
<br/>    -u  --url          Twitter compatible APIExamples: </p>

<p>    twerp -U bear -P sekrit -f
<br/>    twerp -frp
<br/>    twerp status message to post
<br/>    twerp -d decklin direct message to decklinTemplate Format </p>

<p>If you are familiar with how Python specifies the format string then you know exactly how this works :) </p>

<p>Each post coming from Twitter has the following parts: </p>

<p>    Field                   Template
<br/>    user_id                 %(user_id)s
<br/>    user_name               %(user_name)s
<br/>    user_screen_name        %(user_screen_name)s
<br/>    user_description        %(user_description)s
<br/>    user_location           %(user_location)s
<br/>    user_protected          %(user_protected)s
<br/>    user_url                %(user_url)s
<br/>    user_profile_image_url  %(user_profile_image_url)s
<br/>    id                      %(id)s
<br/>    text                    %(text)s
<br/>    source                  %(source)s
<br/>    created_at              %(created_at)sThe parts of each post is stored in a dictionary and then passed to Python as the formatted data source.  To reference the parts, place a field reference in your template string. </p>

<p>The default template string is: %(user_screen_name)s: %(text)s</p>

 title : The qscite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Status (February 2010)I&#39;ve branched the project to work on replacing our own QTerminal classes with QTermWidget that I found else where (it&#39;s a Qt4 port of the Konsole code from KDE).  It&#39;s much more complete and usable than our QTerminal widget was going to be.  Since the QTermWidget project seems to have stagnated, I&#39;m forking it here to fix bugs and add features as necessary. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve stumbled on this project and you want to either help in development or suggest a feature, don&#39;t hesitate to email me: jpsutton@gmail.com. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to hear from any that are actually using QSciTE in the real world, as that&#39;s what we&#39;re developing it for. :) </p>

<p>Project SummaryQSciTE is a clone of the popular SciTE text/code editor.  It&#39;s written in Qt4. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve created this project for several reasons.  First, I was using Mac OS X, and was horrified to find that SciTE was not supported.  Second, I was annoyed that SciTE interface differed quite a bit between the Linux and Win32 implementations. </p>

<p>I put the project in a folder and forgot about it for a while.  After a friend asked me if I knew of a nice Linux code editor with a similar interface as SciTE (besides the GTK port of SciTE itself), I decided to revive it and add more features. </p>

<p>This project utilizes GNU C++ with the Qt4 interface library. In addition, we&#39;re building on the roots of the original SciTE by using the QScintilla2 library, a Qt4 port of the Scintilla library used to build SciTE. </p>

<p>Where ever possible, we&#39;re trying to keep the code cross-platform, however, given the lack of general compatibility between Unix-like operating systems and Windows, we will be forced to implement some features (such as the built-in shell) for Linux and Mac OS X, while maintaining a completely different implementation for Windows. </p>

<p>Latest ReleaseThe latest release is 0.4 (pretty old, you may want to compile from svn...we try to keep the current trunk compilable). </p>

<p>Pre-compiled binaries are available only for Win32 and Mac OS X (10.4 PPC) at the moment.  Linux binaries may be added in the future if we can get the Qt4 and QScintilla2 libraries to compile statically.  If you&#39;re a Linux user, I suspect you probably already know how to compile applications like this; however, if you need a few pointers, we&#39;ve documented a common procedure here. :) </p>

<p>This release is still considered alpha, as some features have not been fully implemented yet (such as proper find/replace support).  New features in this release include... </p>

<p>Win32 Terminal support Backspace is properly supported (unlike the original SciTE) Command history is supported (within the current session) Files now encoded with UTF-8 when saving Command-line parameter support (allows for file associations as well) View/Convert line endings between CR/LF/CRLF Convert indentation on a file (including conversion from tabs to spaces) System tray is now enabled on supporting systems Default directory when opening/saving is now a lot smarter Code folding support (currently has to be enabled per-document) A Find Text dialog has been added (also supports regular expressions!) A LOT of general bug fixes to improve your code editing experience! There are probably more features; if you want to learn more, look through the SVN commit logs :) Have fun!</p>

 title : The romanizedsinhala Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Romanized Sinhala is a convenient alphabet to write Pali so that it can be typed, copied or pasted inside any application without degradation that happens to current romanized Pali. The alphabet is based on Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1 character set) -- the Unicode block that western European languages use. </p>

<p>Communicating in Sinhala over the Internet is difficult for the following reasons: </p>

<p>Unicode requires that you have Unicode font. The glyphs should be correctly positioned on the Unicode table (notice the inaccuracies on Google) You should learn a new keyboard Most importantly, the person at the other end should have everything above. In addition: One cannot read Unicode on a public computer outside Sri Lanka </p>

<p>A secondary romanized alphabet for Sinhala is now available. It is NOT anglicized Sinhala which carries a tinge of elitist snobbery with it (48 years after independence!). </p>

<p>Icelandic inspired this alphabet. Romanized Sinhala has rules similar to Dutch and Italian. It could be used even as a replacement alphabet to the traditional script. This would bring Sinhala at par with the Western European languages -- a definite help for the Sinhala-only group to enter the cyber world. </p>

<p>Updates23/07/2009 : rev18 update to OBJTools to include void hackUVClampToZeroOne(OBJModel m) and void hackUVMapToZeroOne(OBJModel m) functions. These are &quot;in case of emergency break UV&#39;s&quot; functions. Added by request. 18/07/2009 : rev17 fixed materials not showing up when mtl file has extra tabs at the front of lines. Bug found by Noirmain Pierre. 16/06/2009 : rev16 added int getTotalFaceCount() to get the number of total faces. And PVector getFaceVertArray(int faceNumber) this returns an array of PVectors that make up the positions of the verts of the face. These two methods are mainly used for extracting position information from the model. 16/04/2009 : rev15 moved Vert, Normal, and UV&#39;s to be stored in the processing PVector object. Added getNormal methods and objTools. And bug fix for filling with diffuse color  12/07/2008 : rev14 added the first pass of the fast draw method 07/01/2007 : rev13 added some material features (by polymonkey)	  05/29/2007 : rev12 fixed a texture coordinate bug. texture swapping (thanks to polymonkey)	  03/10/2007 : rev11 fixed some major bugs.	  01/30/2006 : rev10 fixed some bugs.	  11/16/2005 : rev09 supported Processing 95+.	  06/18/2005 : rev07 added functions for model transformation	  04/05/2005 : rev06 fixed a few bugs, supports alpha value	  28/04/2005 : rev05 applet execution support	  26/04/2005 : rev04 fixed a texture mapping problem	  25/04/2005 : added FAQ	  24/04/2005 : rev03 fixed a few bugs, 3ds exported .obj support	  19/04/2005 : rev02 .mtl support, normal vertex support, lighting support	  16/04/2005 : rev01 launched	   	 	  </p>

<p>Description 	 This is Wavefront Alias .OBJ file loader for Processing. It loads .OBJ model file and renders the model onto a screen. </p>

<p>Downloadhttp://code.google.com/p/saitoobjloader/downloads/list </p>

<p> 	 	   Installation	   	 After uncompressing the file, copy &#39;objloader/&#39; folder into &#39;libraries/&#39; folder which you can find under the Processing folder. Since the archive file is compressed in MacOSX environment, it might have some needless hidden files. Notice that the file you need is only &#39;objloader&#39; folder and the files in the folder. </p>

<p>The folder/file structure should be as follows. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Restart Processing. You should be able to import the objloader library from sketch menu.   </p>

<p>Reference 	 This library contains a class for loading/rendering a .OBJ file (OBJModel) and a class for accessing each vertex (Vertex) which can be primarily used to addressing vertexes in the model file and transform it. </p>

<p>This is a list of all current functions in the obj loader. Example use can be seen in the above sample project. </p>

<p>void load(String filename) example -&gt; model.load(filename.obj) 
<br/>description -&gt; loads a model file. 
<br/>void draw() example -&gt; model.draw() 
<br/>description -&gt; draws the model. 
<br/>void drawMode(int mode)        </p>

<p>example -&gt; model.drawMode(mode) </p>

<p>description -&gt; set render mode (ex. TRIANGLES, POLYGON, LINES etc.)  
<br/>Basically the argument to this function is same as the one given to beginShape(). POINTS mode isn&#39;t reliable in OPENGL. And you&#39;ve got to turn stroke on to see LINES. TRIANGLES and QUADS are the most reliable but it depends on your export setting. 
<br/>void setTexture(PImage) example -&gt; model.setTexture(PImage) 
<br/>description -&gt; swap the model texture with the specified PImage. 
<br/>void enableTexture() example -&gt; model.enableTexture() 
<br/>description -&gt; enable texture rendering. This is on by default. 
<br/>void disableTexture() example -&gt; model.disableTexture() 
<br/>description -&gt; disable texture rendering. 
<br/>void originalTexture() example -&gt; model.originalTexture() 
<br/>description -&gt; turns on the original texture that is mentioned in the mtl file. This is a useful function once you&#39;ve gone a little crazy with the setTexture function. 
<br/>void enableLocalTexture() example -&gt; model.enableLocalTexture() 
<br/>description -&gt; Use this function before the load function to get the texture from the DATA folder. Some packages (like XSI) save absolute paths into the texture name of the mtl file. This helper function removes the text before the texture filename. At the moment it uses the windows &#39;/&#39; as a separator. I don&#39;t have a Mac or run Linux so if anyone would like to throw an exported mtl file my way I&#39;d be happy to make them work too. 
<br/>void enableMaterial() example -&gt; model.enableMaterial() 
<br/>description -&gt; enables the use of the exported material this is on by default. 
<br/>void disableMaterial() example -&gt; model.disableMaterial() 
<br/>       </p>

<p>description -&gt; disables the use of the exported material. Using this means that you can use fill() before the model draw to set the material to any crazy color. </p>

<p>void clear() example -&gt; model.clear() 
<br/>description -&gt; clears all model data from the model. This way you can get rid of the loaded obj and reload another one. 
<br/>int getVertexsize() example -&gt; model.getVertexsize() 
<br/>description -&gt; returns the number of vertexes that the model contains. 
<br/>Vertex getVertex(int index) example -&gt; model.getVertex(pickNumber) 
<br/>description -&gt; returns the vertex data specified by array index. 
<br/>FAQWhat is .OBJ file?	   	 </p>

<p>.OBJ file is a standard 3D object file format by Alias. </p>

<p>Alias is the leading software company of 3D graphics technology for the film, video, game development, interactive media, industrial design, automotive industry and visualization softwares. Their .OBJ ASCII file format is widely accepted all over the world as a standard format for exchanging data between 3D graphics applications. OBJ files contain solids which are made up of 3 or 4 sided faces and material data such as texture is searatedly stored in .MTL file. 
<br/>  </p>

<p>What is .MTL file?	   	 .OBJ file often has a link to .MTL file, which contains material information such as texture, color and surface reflection. To use the material information, you need to add .MTL file to the project. Currently, OBJModel class supports only texture information. Texture file images (.jpg) should be added to your project too. </p>

<p>Future updates will include support for other material information. 
<br/>Polygons are not correctly rendered. What should I do?	   	 </p>

<p>The first thing you should make sure is what type of polygons your model is composed of. If it is made of quads, the correct option for drawMode() is POLYGON. If it is made of triangles, drawMode(TRIANGLES) still works. drawMode(TRIANGLES) is recommended for Processing BETA 85 because of some rendering bugs (shapes drawn as POLYGONS sometimes don&#39;t show up.) More detailed info is available here (discource: Libraries, Tools - New Libraries: OBJ Loader, Google Web API ) </p>

<p>If the model still doesn&#39;t show up, please send me the Processing source code and .OBJ model files you are trying to render. tatsuyas@ucla.edu 
<br/>  </p>

<p>Texture is not correctly shown. What should I do?	   	 To render texture, three files have to be added to your project: .OBJ file, .MTL file, texture image file. </p>

<p>OBJModel uses standard Processing functions to render models. Inside the library, texture image is stored as PImage object, which means that the texture image file format has to be supported by PImage. Currently it supports .jpg. 
<br/>  </p>

<p>I still have a problem with online execution	  </p>

<p>Hmm.. I updated the library so that it can load models files by relative path whereever a sketch program is located. It might still have a bug. Please send me the model file and the sketch program you have a problem with.

 title : The vsl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GeneralThis is a testing environment used for creating visual surveillance applications. The main idea that stand behind it is to supply the users various surveillance algorithms which they mix together to create different behaviors. </p>

<p>The environment supports plug-in behavior which allows to develop such algorithms in a consistent manner. The application implements a GUI interface based on Windows forms 2.0 and is written entirely using C#. </p>

<p>Motivation1. Anomaly detection  - This is the first motivation for such a system that comes into mind , i.e. the ability to learn somehow what is considered a normal behavior and any behavior that deviates from the normal one is considered an anomaly. An example usage can be in an office building entrance hall were we all know that people go straight to the lobby after they enter the building, so people that decide to go to a different direction can be considered harmful. </p>

<p>2. Automated security - In today’s world when each security guard has to pay attention to several surveillance cameras sometimes automating the entire process can help decrease costs and increase the effectiveness of each guard (pay attention only to certain events that the system already screened for you). </p>

<p>3. Crowed flux statistics - How many cars are using this road, how many cars are coming from road A and how many from road B, by knowing that I can decide which road to widen.  </p>

<p>General structureA surveillance system gets a stream of images and tries to learn from this stream several important facts: </p>

<p>1. Are there any objects in the images, by objects I mean people, cars, suitcases, body limbs (hand, head etc...) and you can add as much as you want to this list. </p>

<p>2. What is the type of the objects, is it a car or a person again you can continue as much as you want. </p>

<p>3. What is the current position of the object in x,y coordinates (maybe even z) </p>

<p>4. Does the position of the object means something to me, does this car in position 10,50 is driving in a valid trajectory. </p>

<p>This project tries to encapsulates this structure in a consistent manner. Each plug-in needs to implement a set of interfaces in order to allow the main program to communicate and configure it. </p>

<p>The project support runtime configuration and runtime information on the various algorithm implementation </p>

 title : The owasp-jsp-testing-tool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project MotivationCross-site scripting is one of the most pervasive web application security vulnerabilities present in today&#39;s applications, ranking at the top of the most recent OWASP Top Ten (2007). Recently, UI frameworks have emerged that allow application developers to create web components quickly and effortlessly. Java EE facilitates this ability by providing JSP tags that can be conglomerated as a tag library, such as was done with Java Server Faces (JSF). These tags allow developers to create rich user interfaces by parameterizing attributes of the web component. With the advent of this design, a unique opportunity arises to prevent cross-site scripting. If tag libraries offered built-in protection from cross-site scripting, then using parameterized web components to prevent cross-site scripting could become analogous to using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. However, security is not always in mind when such tag libraries are developed and thus it is not clear which libraries, if any, offer such built-in protection. This project would allow developers to quickly determine the protection mechanisms provided by any tag libraries they develop or of any third-party tag libraries they are considering using for their application. This will enable a push to parameterize web components which will serve to make web applications safer. </p>

<p>ObjectivesThe goal of this project is to create an easy to use, freely available tool that can be used to quickly ascertain the level of protection that each component of a JSP tag library offers. This information can serve two purposes: </p>

<p>It provides a means for projects to create a coding standard. By identifying which components are safe or unsafe, a project can establish a preference order of useable components. For those components identified as unsafe, extra security requirements can be imposed on any pages using those components It provides tag library providers development guidance. Providers can target security enhancements to the components that are most susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. They can also use these results to demonstrate their performance relative to other competing tag libraries. It also provides feedback for developers that create small custom tag libraries for internal development usage. Ideally, the input to the tool will be the Tag Library Descriptor file along with a compiled version of the tag library. The resulting output will be a report of all tags in the library and their associated attributes with annotations for each attribute indicating whether or not it safely handles tainted input. Additionally, the framework for this tool should be robust enough to enable the functionality indicated by the future work section. </p>

<p>Future VisionWhile tag libraries offer a means to parameterize web components and potentially better protection from XSS, there are still applications that use raw JSPs and scriptlets. With the insight gained from generating test cases, the JSP Testing Tool should be enhanced to test not only pages using JSP tag libraries, but also basic JSPs as well. One possible strategy is to create a wrapper HttpServletRequest class that overrides methods to provide input directly from test cases generated from the earlier stages of this project. A similar wrapper HttpServletResponse class can then be used to test the results. The tool could then be used to quickly test the XSS protection level of any Java EE application that uses JSP technology. Unlike automated web scanners, this tool enhancement would have the benefit of internal insight to the application to determine injectable parameters. Additionally, this tool enhancement would be an improvement to static code analysis as it could reduce the number of false positives with the ability to invoke actual rendering of the HTTP response.</p>

Honeyd enables a single host to claim multiple addresses on a LAN for network simulation. It is possible to ping the virtual machines, or to traceroute them. Any type of service on the virtual machine can be simulated according to a simple configuration file. Instead of simulating a service, it is also possible to proxy it to another machine.</p>

 title : The adosi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Adosi is a media player designed to demonstrate the many capabilities of the Bass streaming audio api. Adosi takes advantage of the new .NET 3.0 WPF interfaces to present a nice clean interface with a bundle of animations and interactions. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Adosi loads the mainstream playlist (.pls) format automatically. Adosi will play all the audio types that are supported in the Bass Audio api. Right now, you can install the Adosi Audio Visual Studio Starter Kit to develop your own features and modifications. </p>

<p>http://adosi.googlecode.com/files/Adosi.vsi </p>

<p>Development is in Beta </p>

<p>Un4seen BassBASS is an audio library for use in Windows and Mac OSX software. Its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, custom generated, and more via add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions. All in a tiny DLL, under 100KB in size. </p>

<p>On Windows, BASS requires DirectX 3 or above for output, and takes advantage of DirectSound and DirectSound3D hardware accelerated drivers, when available. On OSX, BASS uses CoreAudio for output, and OSX 10.3 or above is recommended. Both PowerPC and Intel Macs are supported. </p>

<p>C/C++, Delphi, Visual Basic and MASM APIs are provided, with several examples to get you started. .Net and other APIs are also available.</p>

 title : The beanfiles Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BeanFiles is a java library for importing and exporting javabeans to/from various file formats.  Right now, it only supports importing from csv using opencsv and xls using POI.  Check out the examples. </p>

<p>Beanfiles aims to facilitate type conversion and multiple input/output formats while reusing some of the underlying translation components. </p>

<p>The library currently supports importing only, but has some useful features.  It supports the following: </p>

<p>No configuration (if column headers match bean property names) Property Mapping (if column headers do not match bean property names) Nested property resolutions (bean.childBean.property.whatever) Simple wildcard mappings (image* will build a list of strings where column header is imageXyz) Easily add custom translators (for instance a column is an id, and the bean property is a lookup) A nice use-case is creating beans with the beanfiles library, then using Hibernate to store objects to a relational model. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a Google group for discussing this project: </p>

<p>http://groups.google.com/group/beanfiles 
<br/>Example UsageConsider the following csv file: </p>

<p>property1,property2,property3,property4,property5
<br/>line1_prop1,line1_prop2,line1_prop3,1,FALSE
<br/>line2_prop1,line2_prop2,line2_prop3,2,TRUEIn order to map this data to the following Java Bean: </p>

<p>public class SimpleBean {</p>

<p>    private String property1;
<br/>    private String property2;
<br/>    private String property3;
<br/>    private int property4;
<br/>    private boolean property5;</p>

<p>    public SimpleBean() {}</p>

<p>    public String getProperty1() {
<br/>        return property1;
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    public void setProperty1(String property1) {
<br/>        this.property1 = property1;
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    ...
<br/>}
<br/>Here&#39;s the Beanfiles code: </p>

<p>        InputStream input = getInputStream(&quot;files/csv/simple_properties.csv&quot;);
<br/>        ReaderIterator iterator = new CSVReaderIterator(SimpleBean.class, input);

 title : The csikk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewCsikk is a small webserver written in Python. It extends the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler found in the standard Python library (not the best solution but reduces library dependencies and helps portability). What Csikk does is it makes possible to browse someone&#39;s music folder on the network, view music files metadata (not just pure filenames) and download directory contents as ZIP or as M3U playlist for streaming using your favourite music player. Csikk was not intented for massive usage rather to share music with the guys at home and/or at the office. Ideally you would need Csikk in situations like when only one computer is connected to the speaker system on a network, and copying large folders from one machine to another instead of streaming them would be a waste of time. Here are some screenshots and the list of features. </p>

<p>The following third-party libraries are required: </p>

<p>Jinja (HTML templating system) PyYaml (YAML parser for Python) mutagen (media metadata information) </p>

<p>Since Csikk was built on Jinja templates, you can customize the look and feel pretty easily by editing the HTML and CSS files. Furthermore there&#39;s an option in the config file to specify the template you want to use. Csikk comes with two default templates, one with an integrated flash-based music player. </p>

<p>Current version: 0.4.2 </p>

<p>Please read Todos and Plans and feel free to share your comments and suggestions with me! </p>

<p>Issues and limitationsFor a list of issues please have a look at the issues list. </p>

<p>Current limitations: </p>

<p>csikk only handles .mp3 and .ogg metadata, cause I didn&#39;t have much time to further examine the mutagen lib (just as of yet of course) since csikk relies on the standard BaseHTTPServer of Python and it is very a simple thing, csikk is really meant for streaming on a LAN Releases and changes0.4.2fixed a bug which prevented Internet Explorer to display pages well updated the non-flash template to really differ only in the exclusion of XSPF 0.4.1this is a bugfix release: fixed thread handling (now stream threads terminate correctly) now ZIP files are also served in a separate thread 0.4now handling cache control HTTP headers (If-Modified-Since and Last-Modified) simple object cache for storing generated templates threads (now streaming has no effect on browsing) fixed startup path searching 0.2 and 0.3all css defs are now in style.css (stripped from the html) added sessions to store view settings swf player button added (using XSPF Player) now song lengths appear too minor usability changes: folderlist is completely invisble when its count is zero... ...and filelist behaves also the same. added breadcrumb navigation other small changes in the layout added types.yaml (for tuning the filelist) now folders are downloadable as a single zip added config options allow-zip-downloads and zip-name 0.1.1got rid off some redundand code (source is now more modular!) added support for ogg vorbis files! added new config options: template and m3u-name (also added some guiding comments to the config file!) added a play button next to folder names to increase usability 0.1initial release</p>

 title : The deus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DEUS aims to become one of the reference tools in the field of complex system simulation. It provides a simple Java API which allows to implement  </p>

<p>nodes (i.e. the parts which interact in a complex system, leading to emergent behaviors.. humans, pets, cells, robots, intelligent agents, etc.) events (e.g. node births/deaths, interactions among nodes, interactions with the environment, logs, etc. - briefly, whatever you want!)  processes (stochastic or deterministic, they regulate the timeliness of events) Configuration scripts for simulations must be written in XML (using the DEUS schema). In the near future a graphical editor will be introduced. </p>

<p>Currently you can checkout the source code, which comes as an Eclipse project and includes many examples. Soon, the examples will be removed from the source repository and released separately.  </p>

<p>If you do not want to checkout the source code, you can use the deus-x.y.z.jar which is available in the downloads section. </p>

<p>A paper introducing DEUS has been presented at SIMUTools 2009, in Rome. It is a good reference to understand the phylosophy and the architecture of DEUS. You may find it in the downloads section. </p>

<p>NEWS </p>

<p>In version 0.4.3 we have introduced a new implementation of the event queue, that now is much more efficient: the insertion of a new event in the right position, according to the timestamp, costs now O(logN) - while previously the cost was O(NlogN). The Visual Editor has been included in the source tree, and the related User Manual (italian version) has been added to the &quot;Downloads&quot; section. There you find also the latest version of deus-lib.jar.</p>
 summary : <p>This is the multiplatform-based version of an earlier incarnation of what was originally meant to be a fully-automated icecast radio station server framework.  This included features such as a graphical font &quot;now playing&quot; image generation, randomized playlists from multiple folders, random jingles at specified interval support, and finally, a TTS radio &quot;DJ&quot; which told listeners what songs they were listening to (since originally the stream it was developed for was in-game). </p>

<p>Many of those features are not quite polished off yet in this port, but hopefully putting it up online will make it easier to collaborate with others in bringing it up to feature parity with the original .NET version. </p>

<p>This version was written in Python by Coda, with the replayer written in C.</p>

 summary : <p>Overview: </p>

<p>Fishconnect is a PHP layer for FBIXML or the Fishbowl XML SDK. It was created in an effort to simply communicate to the Fishbowl Inventory SDK using PHP. </p>

<p>The project is it its beginning stages and includes several PHP functions that will create and handle FBIXML requests and responses using some generic xml parsing functions.  </p>

<p>There are several examples and tests that illustrate how to use the PHP functions that have been created including handling security tickets, getting customer name lists, and creating customers in Fishbowl.  </p>

<p>The examples have been created to connect to the example.fdb database that is the default database provided by Fishbowl Inventory for testing and evaluation. </p>

<p>Installing:  </p>

<p>A web server is required for running PHP files. This project was created using xampp for windows. </p>

<p>The Fishbowl Inventory server 2009.3 is required in order to run and test using fishconnect functions. </p>

<p>Simply unzip the fishconnect directory and copy it to your htdocs directory. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/fishconnect/sdk/ to run the existing tests. You will need to approve the fishconnect connection in the Fishbowl Inventory Server integrated applications. </p>

 title : The glextensions Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OpenGL ExtensionsThis project serves as a catalog of OpenGL Extensions with examples. </p>

<p>Often, OpenGL developers require looking at the original OpenGL specifications in order to make sense of new or rarely used extensions. Even the specifications themselves are over whelming and not very clear in how to use the extension. </p>

<p>Some of the larger extensions provide code examples, but these are few and far between. </p>

<p>We hope to provide a simplified version of the OpenGL extension specification which includes many of the sections that affect developers (e.g. new state variables and error conditions) while leaving out sections specific to implementing the extensions (e.g. the issues section). Along with the specifications, we will eventually implement code examples with walkthroughs explaining the steps needed as well as a repository of sample code. </p>

 title : The istreamlight Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>iStreamLightIntroductioniStreamLight is a small Cocoa-native set of classes that encapsulates the Lightstreamer textual protocol in a simple and powerful framework. </p>

<p>It lets you have multiple clients connected to different Lighstreamer servers, multiple sessions for each client and multiple tables for each session. The streaming mechanism is completely event driven, asynchronous and each session runs on its own thread. </p>

<p>What is contained hereThe source repository contains a pair of XCode 3.1 projects: </p>

<p>iStreamLightTest is a simple command-line utility for Mac OS X 10.5 designed to test the library main capabilities, it connects to Lightstreamer home page stream and starts publishing updates via standard output; iStreamLightApp is an iPhone application with a simple GUI that lets you subscribe to an item on the Lightstreamer home page stream and see its data pushed. </p>

<p>DistributionThe library is released on the public domain as free and open source software. It is distributed as source code only, for now, because it is really small and simple. </p>

<p>VersioningThe version under iStreamLightApp can be considered the development version. As soon as it is sufficiently tested, the version on iStreamLightTest will be aligned. At the moment iStreamLightApp version is 0.9.8 and differs from 0.8 of iStreamLightTest for: </p>

<p>the fixing of issue #2; the fixing of issue #1; the addition of the new adapter sets of Lightstreamer 3.5; a few UI improvements; a better stream error handling; other minor fixes.    </p>

<p>CompatibilityVersion 0.8 in iStreamLightTest has been tested on Mac OS X 10.5, version 0.9.8 in iStreamLightApp on iPhone SDK 3.0. Please report any compatibility issues that should come out. </p>

<p>DemosHere you can see a video of iStreamLightApp at work on the iPhone simulator, side-by-side with Lightstreamer home page: </p>

<p>iStreamLight and Lightstreamer video </p>

<p>The library is currently used in Share Price application: </p>

<p>SharePrice </p>

<p>To doTons of things, and between them: </p>

<p>Add support for proxies (yes, yes, that&#39;s important... be patient) Add SSL support (this could be quite hard...) </p>

<p>What worksThe library is able to: </p>

<p>Connect to a Lightstreamer server and open a session Subscribe items and receive updates through events Automatically rebind the session when the content length expires Unsubscribe items and stop receiving updates </p>

<p>Other things may work too, as most of the protocol is already implemented. It has not been thoroughly tested, though. </p>

 title : The itunespublisher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>iTunes Publisher 4 exports playlists from iTunes into the following formats: </p>

<p>HTML - Export your playlists to web pages that can go straight to your website. Share playlists with your friends, and even automatically link to your MP3 files (don&#39;t steal music!). You can export to multiple pages for large playlists, and links between the pages are automatically generated. Exports can be either song-based or album-based. Tabbed Text - Import your playlist into databases or spreadsheets. Quicktime Streaming Server - Create QTSS playlists easily so you can avoid the annoying interface provided by Apple. M3U - A general playlist format. Works with WinAmp and some other audio applications. Originally developed by Josh Aas. This application is no longer actively maintained. </p>

<p>&quot;There are tons of reasons to print out your Playlists, but iTunes&#39; Export Song List creates a list that&#39;s too detailed and confusing for normal use. iTunes Publisher lets you specify which of iTunes&#39; copious information fields to include. Use it to export any Playlist - even your whole Library - to plain text, HTML, or even a Quicktime Streaming Server Playlist.&quot; </p>

 title : The jspeedstreamer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JSpeedStreamer is a proxy to speed up streaming media over HTTP by using multiple parallel threads for a single download. It differs from a download manager in that it delivers the data in order so that the resulting stream can be played through MPlayer, VLC or any other media player that can stream over HTTP. </p>

<p>JSpeedStreamer receives a HTTP request and then divides up that request into segments, each segment is assigned to a downloading thread and is downloaded using the HTTP Range header. The threads download their data into a circular buffer and the data is delivered to the proxy client - without it knowing that there are multiple threads downloading its request.</p>

 title : The smallx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Smallx is a library and set of tools that is being developed to process XML infosets. It has two distinct features in that the infoset implementation allows streaming of documents and that processing of infosets can be accomplished using a concept called pipelines. The library contains a full compliment of technologies--include XPath and XSLT. </p>

<p>Pipelines provide the ability to chain together different components that perform different tasks to process a XML document. Some of these tasks might be decision points in the processing while other might transform the input (e.g. XSLT). All components in the pipeline have the ability to stream the infoset it they so choose. </p>

<p>The key difference of this code over others is that it allows streaming of infosets to be mixed in with non-streamed document-based processing. This allows large data sets to be processed in a minimal amount of memory while allowing traditional technologies like XSLT to still be used.</p>

<p>The HME library was built based on Tivo documentation for the protocol.  This library is not provided by or supported by Tivo. </p>

<p>Please contact me if you have any questions or feedback. </p>

<p>Josh Cooley -  jbtivo@tuxinthebox.net </p>

<p>News/UpdatesSeptember 13, 2009 </p>

<p>I&#39;ve released a bug fix for the Tivo.Hmo library that allows content to be downloaded from a tivo.  Thanks to the mono team I was able to use some of their code to work around an issue with the cookies sent by a tivo. </p>

<p>August 31, 2009 </p>

<p>This has been waiting in SVN for a while.  It incorporates all the changes mentioned below. </p>

<p>February 11, 2009 </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on the 2.0 release.  It is almost complete and now in checked in to the source tree.  The main feature for this release is a replacement of the host http services.  Mp3s and streaming videos have a better web server to provide these files thanks to the Mono project.  I&#39;ve incorporated the web server portions into the Tivo.Hme.Host.dll but have added a dependency on Mono.Security.  This new dependency will be part of the package when a new release is made. </p>

<p>In addition to source changes, you may notice three new links in the featured wiki pages on the right.  These are entries into the api docs for Tivo.Hme.dll.  The documentation is a little thin right now, but will be updated as soon as I go through and add the necessary XML comments. </p>

<p>October 21, 2008 </p>

<p>The new release is now out.  It&#39;s a minor update for the HME library.  This release includes a refresh of some samples as well as some hosting changes.  I provide an http service available to HME apps.  It&#39;s just a prototype and will definitely change in later releases.  The disk usage app does have the promised bug fix as well as the new HMO sdk.  There&#39;s no independent download of that yet.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out what else is necessary for a useful HMO sdk. </p>

<p>October 14, 2008 </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on a sample for the video streaming as well as support and sample for the transport command.  I should have a release of the hme sdk, samples, and disk usage app soon.  The disk usage application has an overhauled hmo library that should fix a reported bug as well as be the beginning of an independently usable hmo library.  It&#39;s currently very limited, but is closer to what I want than the previous version. </p>

<p>August 4, 2008 </p>

<p>An updated version of the library has been released that supports streaming video.  At the same time, I&#39;ve released a preview of the hosting service for hme applications.  It runs as a windows service and requires manual configuration currently.  Please check the readme in the HmeApplicationServer directory for very basic installation instructions.  As stated earlier, I plan on having a configuration tool to help with administering this service. </p>

<p>June 5, 2008 </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on a new release for a while.  The main enhancement is a new service that can host hme applications.  The main work left is to build a configuration tool and an installer.  If your interested, you can download the source and check it out.</p>
 title : The tivostream Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OBSOLETENote, this application now has been obsoleted by a new and improved Streaming Video HME server which has all tivostream features and much more:http://code.google.com/p/streambaby/At this point no further updates to tivostream are planned.INTRODUCTIONA Java HME streaming video server for Tivos which lets you stream video (mpeg2/h.264 mpeg4) to your series 3 Tivos from your computer(s). Unlike Tivo To Come Back (TTCB) a copy of the source video is not made on your Tivo. Some advantages over TTCB are: </p>

<p>No copy is made on the Tivo, so you don&#39;t have to worry about deleting it after watching You can organize your videos in any structure you like on your computer to make them easy to find rather than having to copy them to Tivo and live with very limited organization capabilities of the Tivo. You can store your video files in multiple places across multiple file volumes and give friendly names to the shares you wish tivostream to see. All the shares you configure are then available in one place in the initial tivostream screen with names of your choice. For mpeg4/h.264 videos you can watch them in their native format without having to transcode to mpeg2 on the fly as Tivo Desktop (or other TTCB applications) currently does. Since the HME server is in complete control of remote control functions it&#39;s possible to define further navigation options than is possible with normal Tivo video playback such as arbitrary skip n minutes back or forwards and other interesting ideas. </p>

<p>This application presents a hierarchical file browser where you can browse for video files located anywhere on the server running HME (your computer). You can specify 1 or more shares and give them friendly names and they all are presented in the opening screen. You can then select any of the shares and navigate to a file to stream to your Tivo. You can then watch the video with all the normal navigation functions you are used to (plus some more interesting ones). You can left click out of the video to return to the file browser mode to select more videos to watch or to exit the application. </p>

<p>NOTE: Currently a major drawback of streaming to Tivo is there is a 1.1GB buffer limit, so it&#39;s not possible to stream over that limit without interrupted playback right now. For mpeg2 playback it&#39;s possible to workaround the problem by resuming viewing where playback stops. For H.264 viewing there is no workaround. </p>

<p>SCREENSHOTSPC Server console  </p>

<p>TiVo Entry screen  TiVo Top level screen  TiVo Folder views  TiVo Video file views  TiVo Paused playback  </p>

<p>ENCODING H.264 MPEG4 FOR TIVOThe documentation contains specifics on the kinds of encodings (mpeg2 &amp; mpeg4) that Series 3 Tivos are able to handle. For mpeg4 only H.264 video seems to be currently supported. If you are encoding from an mpeg2 source with AC3 audio the following encoding profile using ffmpeg seems to work pretty well: </p>

<p>ffmpeg -y -i inputFile.mpg -vcodec libx264 -coder 0 -level 31 -r 29.97 -sameq -g 300 -bufsize 14745k -b 2000k -maxrate 16000k -bug &quot;+autodetect+ms&quot; -me epzs -trellis 2 -mbd 1 -acodec copy -f mp4 outputFile.mp4 </p>

<p>NOTE: Following an encoding you will also have to run it through qt-faststart to be able to stream it to Tivo (see documentation for details). </p>

<p>In the above you can adjust bitrate (-b 2000k) to be higher or lower depending on quality desired. For HD encodes using an 8000k bitrate works pretty well. </p>

<p>The documentation also covers an easy way to encode using Handbrake, however from my findings ffmpeg encodes from DVD sources produce much better and smoother looking video. </p>

 title : The xmsharp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>There are two &#39;projects&#39; here.  One is the XMSharp C# library for developers to use in their own applications, the other is a MediaPortal plugin which uses the XMSharp C# library to make it possible for MediaPortal users to listen to XM Radio. </p>

<p>1. About XMSharpXMSharp is an XM Radio Internet Streaming library.  It handles logging in, fetching Channel information (including current song/artist/album for each channel and notifications of channel updates).  It uses VLC to playback the streams currently. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>XMSharp NewsSource code moved to googlecode&#39;s svn server! 2. About XMSharp MediaPortal PluginXMSharp was originally designed simply to be used in a MediaPortal plugin to allow XM Radio streaming.  This project was designed with using it in a MediaPortal plugin in mind, so the plugin project is also included. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>InstallationCopy all the files except the &#39;skins&#39; folder into your &#39;Team MediaPortal\Plugins\windows\&#39; folder. From the appropriate skin folder inside the &#39;skins&#39; folder, copy the xmsharpmp.xml file into the corresponding folder in your &#39;Team MediaPortal\Plugins\skins\</p>

<p>\&#39; folder. </p>

<p>NOTE: You must also install VideoLAN&#39;s VLC Player INCLUDING the ActiveX Control option during the installation.  You can get the installation here: http://www.videolan.org  If you do not install the ActiveX Control for VLC, you will get an Incompatible Version error when loading the plugin! </p>

<p>News09-Aug-2008Version: 1.0.4 Released Added locking so multiple threads can access XMSharp&#39;s channels.  This should prevent MediaPortal from crashing hard as often as it was in the last release! Fixed all the skin files where the navigation from the button for Preset 3 was not as expected. 08-Aug-2008Version: 1.0.2 Released Some people are having issues with an incompatible plugin version error I&#39;ve put up v1.0.3 for download which I&#39;m hoping will fix this Please try the new download and if it does not work still, post in the forum or here in the issues 07-Aug-2008Uploaded first build/release of the MediaPortal Plugin</p>

 summary : <p>The Bleu-Romtools are a set of tools that I&#39;ve created over the years that have helped me create and edit ROMs for Arcade game hardware.  Some of these tools will work with other systems as well. </p>

<p>Genroms will take the output from your assembler/compiler as an Intel Hex File (IHX), and pad it out into a defined ROM space.  It will also pre-load the ROM space with ROM image files, so that you can make quick, reproducible patches for ROMs </p>

<p>TuracoCL is a portable command line reimplementation of the TuracoClassic tool.  It has no graphical interface (yet), and is meant to be run in an automated fashion from the command line or a makefile, which was not possible with older versions of this codebase.  It loads and saves PCX and ROM file formats.  Current development efforts will add an optional curses-based user interface, to allow for ROM editing from shell windows. </p>

<p>TuracoClassic is a DOS-based sprite image editor for arcade graphics ROMs.  It is quite old, and only works on DOS.  It is highly based on AGE, but mostly re-implemented from  scratch with future expansion and flexibility in mind.  TuracoClassic requires MS-DOS libraries and has no command-line interface to control it. </p>

<p>AGE is an even older DOS-based sprite image editor, like Turaco.  It has a primitive graphical interface, and a Pac-Man map editor.  It has its shortcomings, but works.</p>

 summary : <p>As part of my final project at the RCA, I am developing Blog Bot Platform, the development of blogging robots that talk about their experiences. My hope by open sourcing the code is to foster a community of independent implementations that can be injected back into my work.  </p>

<p>My Scernarios for Blog Bots are currently being exhibited at the Royal College of Art Show 2008. You can also follow them on twitter, http://twitter.com/lightbloggerbot http://twitter.com/stormbloggerbot http://twitter.com/explorerblogbot. </p>

<p>Hardware implementation and Documentation are in SVN </p>

<p>The Jar file can be downloaded and configured if you do not want to play with source, very experimental. Adjust the files in config directory for your Blog Bot. </p>

<p>Blog Bot Platform makes use of RXTX for Serial (and Parallel) communication, eventually this will need to be integrated into the program (perhaps in a separate LIB folder?) But for now you will have to install it separately as part of your java runtime. For now, you can get RXTX from http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/</p>

 title : The digital-picture-frame Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>status:This project is NOT yet ready for end-user use.  If you want to help develop, let the administrator know. </p>

<p>description:digital-picture-frame will eventually be available in three forms: </p>

<p>a set of shell scripts (that will run on ubuntu, but maybe more generalized later), a binary package (initially a .deb for ubuntu, but maybe more distributions later), an entire distribution (so you can boot it up on a cd and install ubuntu + digital-picture-frame directly with as little fuss as possible). Development effort will start with the first form and gradually progress to the third. </p>

<p>software:As it is now, digital-picture-frame is a set of shell scripts uses a fresh install of ubuntu feisty fawn as a base, and sets the machine up as much as possible to ease the creation of a digital picture frame.  Uses the framebuffer (no x windows).  Runs on a modest machine (my test machine is a pentium 233 laptop). </p>

<p>After some more development, it will be a binary .deb package that anyone can install on their existing ubuntu box.  It&#39;ll have some sort of setup program (whether it&#39;s a gui, ncurses or just a script that prompts the user to answer a set of questions depends on how much effort gets put into it). </p>

<p>The final stage is to have a full mini-distribution based on ubuntu.  This option should make it easy to convert any old computer into a digital picture frame. </p>

<p>hardware:Hardware modification is also part of the project (generally, turning the screen of a laptop around so it&#39;s like a tablet). </p>

<p>Why Ubuntu?Because it&#39;s the linux distro I&#39;ve tried that comes closest to the &quot;just-works&quot; ideal (for the record, I&#39;ve tried redhat 6, fedora core 1, gentoo 2005.0 to present, slackware 9 through 11, damn small linux 3, and a bunch of others that didn&#39;t even boot from their cds). </p>

<p>Why not just buy one?  They&#39;re not that expensive anymore.I didn&#39;t have $80 to spare on this project.  I did have an old laptop, though. </p>

<p>history:The first infant version of digital-picture-frame ran on Damn Small Linux (DSL), chosen because of its small installation footprint. It was a pain to compile everything that I needed for DSL (fbi and netatalk/afpd have a bunch of dependencies), but I did get it to work.  After that effort, I decided I should go for a more complete/modern/supported distribution. </p>

<p>The second version ran/runs on slackware 11.  I still had to compile fbi and netatalk/afpd, but it was easier on slackware.  This is where development currently is most mature. </p>

<p>I recently installed ubuntu (feisty fawn) on one of my main machines and noticed that fbi and netatalk/afpd were packages that were already available and installable in a couple of clicks.  I realized that if I was gonna distribute digital-picture-frame, it was gonna have to be on ubuntu (or something where fbi and netatalk were already available), or I&#39;d have to package the two myself in addition to writing digital-picture-frame.  Ubuntu is simply the easiest option for this reason. </p>

<p>If anyone has a DSL or slackware package for fbi or netatalk, please let me know.  I&#39;ll still aim for ubuntu because it&#39;s easier to use than DSL or slackware, but it&#39;d be nice to have options for people that can&#39;t get ubuntu to work.</p>

<p>Completely re-written gui Replaced dialogs with a status bar to alert you of changes Above fixed a memory leak (me so sorry) New interface to eee.ko that gets rid of using qt for file i/o (reusable for other projects) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>eeeqtweak is aimed at giving you full control over some of the hardware on the eeepc701 series and maybe other ones after some time. All using a qt based gui you can change the front side bus and over clock your processor, change the fan speed to whatever you want and also gives you the ability to have a warning to go off for when your processor gets to a certain temperature that pops up in a balloon from the system tray. It also gives a constant readout in LCD widgets of the rpm of the fan and the temperature of the processor. It has the possibility to be minimized into the system tray hiding the rest of the program while giving you the ability to get tooltips about the temperature and rpm and also the balloon for temperature warnings. </p>

<p>This heavily relies on the eee.ko kernel module, so if you want to even think about using this, you need to check out http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:overclockfsb . </p>

<p>There is no documentation as of now and no guarantee it will compile for you but it should if you have the correct libs(should be in the non-existant documentation), basically qt 4.4.0 .</p>

 title : The glsnake Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>glsnake is an imitation of Rubiks&#39; Snake. The snake is made up of 24 triangular prisms (half-cubes) connected on the square faces by a rotational joint. The snake may be rotated and manipulated into a variety of shapes. </p>

<p>&quot;I think a lot of the basis of the open source movement comes from procrastinating students.&quot; 
<br/>-- Andrew Tridgell 
<br/>glsnake was written originally by Andrew Bennetts and Peter Aylett for the Allegro graphics library. Later, Jamie Wilkinson appeared and ported the code to use OpenGL. The code has gradually been improved over the months following. </p>

<p>Currently, glsnake has an interactive mode where you can create your own models, colour highlighting of different model classes, as well as mouse support. </p>

<p>It also has been ported to XScreenSaver. The screensaver version is non-interactive, but does attempt to load locally created models made with the interactive toy version. Controls </p>

<p>Use the right mouse button to drag the object to a new orientation. &#39;i&#39; will toggle interactive mode. Once in interactive mode, use the cursor keys to select a joint and rotate it. The home key resets to the straight snake. &#39;q&#39; will quit. &#39;s&#39; will toggle sane normals against some weird normals. &#39;w&#39; will toggle wireframe mode. &#39;e&#39; and &#39;E&#39; change the explode distance. &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; change the speed of rotation.</p>

 title : The gridnix Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Gridnix installs on top of (virtually) any GNU/Linux based operating system and helps average people combine many computers into one easy to scale and manage entity. </p>

<p>Thanks to technology such as Xen, Gridnix allows average people to make the most of off the shelf hardware. Run several GNU/Linux clusters independently on the same hardware, deploy a distributed computing project or create a corporate network that spans the globe. Gridnix helps make setting up complex web, email and database clusters easier for novice users as well as seasoned Linux administrators. </p>

<p>Gridnix uses its own platform independent 100% non blocking interconnect to facilitate communication between nodes, srce. Gridnix is non destructive and can be easily installed or removed from any computer capible of running the GNU C compiler in its minimal form but requires the full standard set of GNU core utilities and libraries for anything but trivial use. </p>

<p>Gridnix is written to function well on small memory model (embedded) GNU/Linux systems, but will take full advantage of multi-core 64 bit architecture. Support for other platforms such as ia64 / RISC will be included. </p>

<p>Gridnix requires a Linux kernel as a &#39;root&#39; on its nodes, but enjoys the same limitless possibilities afforded by paravirtualization and hardware assisted virtualization (HVM) thanks to the efforts of the Xen and QEMU communities. Plans are underway to incoporate technologies other than Xen such as OpenVZ in the near future. While Gridnix takes advantage of virtualization technology, it does not depend on virtualization for its usefulness. Gridnix will help bring any conventional GNU/Linux farm under control and central management. </p>

<p>Gridnix is licensed under the GNU Public License, with exceptions for linked libraries which are released under the LGPL. </p>

<p>Gridnix is written in C, with bash, python and perl wrappers. Gridnix is very easy to modify and customize with average programming and scripting skills. Gridnix believes that functionality and ease of modification should userp elegance of code, given that ideal all code is crafted as efficiently and elegantly as possible to meet GNU standards. </p>

<p>Gridnix includes its own Linux shell (grsh), a major update of dash that includes Gridnix specific functions as built ins to reduce forking over a distributed grid. Gridnix plans to integrate more macros and builtins to grsh as needs for them are evidenced. </p>

<p>An alpha testing release of Gridnix will be made available by June, 2007. More information on the project will soon be found on its home page.</p>

 title : The phpBB mini Knowledge Base Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hatch is open source, extensible, and aimed at IC and FPGA designers. </p>

<p>Hatch uses a high level register interface description in Python to generate RTL (Verilog), XML, and various documentation formats including HTML and LaTex.  This allows the documentation source code and register RTL to exist in the same file, which helps to ensure that neither becomes out of date. </p>

<p>Hatch also includes a register access tool for communicating with devices holding a design.  Registers in a device are accessed by name via the Python console after the generated XML for the design has been parsed.  (Turning device LED&#39;s on &amp; off from the Python console is a pleasant way to set about debugging.) </p>

<p>The Python register access tool supports tab-complete, persistent history, and logging facilities.  It may also be used in Python scripts to automate testing or as part of an application interface to the hardware.  In addition, the tool can be configured to communicate with devices using various interfaces, such as a serial port. </p>

<p>Similar c interfaces can be built based on header files that can be generated by Hatch to your needs. </p>

<p>Software like Hatch is too simple to sell but also too expensive to write from scratch, so we hope you use it.  It&#39;s still in progress, so please see the &quot;Test or &quot;Examples&quot; directory to get started.</p>

 title : The ibsnmp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>InfiniBand networks, as other networks, need to be monitored and managed for administrator and development needs, the usage of this technology become more widespread; it’s involved in bigger clusters and high-performance networking, therefore, the need for such a tool becomes more essential. Besides, a lot of information about InfiniBand traffic is stored in the hardware, this is derived from its architecture which implements most of the layers in hardware, and this information is usually not exposed to the application layer, which makes the task to retrieve this information more difficult without a tool designed for this purpose. </p>

<p>To achieve this goal, we used in this project a standard network management protocol called SNMP, because this protocol is one of the most popular solutions for network monitoring, there are many monitors which relies on this protocol to offer to the user a friendly interface such as IBM Tivoli and HP OpenView, for the same reason, collecting information from InfiniBand devices and other devices (CPU, memory, NIC…) , can be done using the same tool. </p>

<p>So far, there was no such a tool for InfiniBand network management, although it was invented and used since 1996. The tool we present in this project is the only one of its kind in this field.</p>

 title : The jabberwocky-oscilloscope Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Jabberwocky is an acronym for Just Another Big Bandwidth Event Recorder With Oscilloscope Capabilities. </p>

<p>It is a combination of hardware designs and software that uses an ASIC switched-capacitor-array AtoD converter to make a handheld, battery/usb powered, 2 channel oscilloscope with an organic LED display. </p>

<p>Development on the oscilloscope was started in January, 2008.  A design was finalized and a board was fabricated in May of that year. </p>

<p>overviewThe oscilloscope is battery (rechargable LiPoly) or usb powered, has 2 channels of input (DC coupled only), has a 128×124 pixel full-color OLED display. It supports (slightly) advanced triggering or an optional trigger-delay. </p>

<p>The input impedance of this scope is 1MOhm. The analog bandwidth is unknown at this point (and will be until the project is nearly complete). The lab3 can sample billions of times per second, but this oscilloscope will probably only be useful at a much much lower sampling speed. This is due to the choice of input amplifier and multiplexer: The multiplexer has a bandwidth of about 700MHz as does the voltage-feedback operational amplifier. </p>

<p>still to toAt this point, there is some preliminary software running on the device to capture a trace with the microcontroller’s onboard AtoD converter and display it and allow selection of vertical scale, vertical offset and horizontal scale. Software to control the external trigger-delay has been written and tested. </p>

<p>Further software must be written to get data from the lab3 and control the DACs. After that is complete, bandwidth &amp; slew-rate testing will be carried out and presented here. </p>

<p>(The current status is not yet ready for end-user use.)</p>
 title : The jlsm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jlsm can be used to visualize the SCL and pulse data from the Wild Divine biofeedback hardware. It can also be used to visualize and practice breath/HRV synchronization through the IHR graph and the IHR power spectrum graph. </p>

<p>It is inspired by Bryan Ingram&#39;s Lightstone Monitor. </p>

<p>To run it, download the release, unzip it and run the &quot;run.bat&quot; file. You will also need to make sure you have Java installed on your machine. The current release is only packaged for Windows XP. </p>

<p>The source is currently embedded in the jlsm.jar in the download. There is also some source code to read the Lightstone USB/HID hardware using C (Cygwin) and JNI through JNA in Windows and using javax.usb in Linux. </p>

<p>Here is an image showing the application running. </p>

 title : The johnos Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>John ProjectQuesta è la home page del wiki relativo al pregetto John. </p>

<p>John ProjectIl progettoJohn, What&#39;s it?JohnOSJLibraryStato del progettoRiferimentiContatti </p>

<p>Il progettoLe pretese di questo progetto sono infinite, come le possibilità che si propone di offrire tanto agli sviluppatori come agli utenti finali. L&#39;obbiettivo (o forse sogno) è quello di introdurre il programma principale JohnOS in ogni casa, ufficio, impresa, ospedale, ecc... per aiutare l&#39;utente in qualisiasi ambito. Con un poco di fantasia si può immaginare l&#39;evoluzione di questo progetto come un qualsiasi film di fantascienza, con un computer dotato di intelligenza artificiale in grado di rispondere alle domande, oppure un frigorifero mai vuoto perchè chiama il supermercato prima che termini il latte, ecc... L&#39;idea pratica di fondo è quella di poter collegare qualsiasi dispositivo presente in una casa con il programma in modo che tutti i dispositivi possano dialogare e collaborare. </p>

<p>John, What&#39;s it?John è un progetto per la creazione di un sistema di domotica. Il progetto comprende due programmi: JohnOS e JohnHome, e una libreria: JLibrary. </p>

<p>JohnOSJohnOS (John Operative System) è il cuore del sistema domotico basato su plugin. Con questo programma si tenta di creare una base d&#39;appoggio per la creazione di plugin da abbinare a determinati dispositivi o plugin che aggiugnano funzioni al core. Il riferimento al sistema operativo è dato dal fatto che i due tipi di plugin possono essere visti come driver e programmi propri di un sitema operativo. Ogni dispositivo collegato al sistema è gestito da un plugin del primo tipo e ogni funzione incorporata nel sistema è, invece, un plugin del secondo tipo. L&#39;obbiettivo di questo programma è quello di fornire una base sulla quale sviluppare i propri plugin, mantenendo come limite la propria fantasia. Le caratteristiche principali sono: </p>

<p>Gestore dei plugin; Gestore dei dispositivi; Gestore dei messaggi; Server hardware per la comunicazione con i dispositivi; Server web per fornire un&#39;interfaccia grafica. </p>

<p>JohnHomeData la complessità del sistema, non si possono testare direttamente le funzioni su dei dispositivi reali, per questo motivo nasce JohnHome; ovvero una virtualizzazione della casa. JohnHome permette di utilizzare a pieno JohnOS senza distruggere casa! Impostando JohnOS per dialogare con JohnHome si può testare ogni plugin semplicemente virtualizzando i dispositivi necessari al test. Le caratteristiche di questo programma sono: </p>

<p>Gestore dei plugin; Gestore dei dispositivi virtuali; Interfaccia grafica per accedere comodamente ai dispositivi virtuali; Caricamento/salvataggio da file di una casa virtuale; </p>

<p>JLibraryJLibrary è la libreria in supporto ai due programmi sopracitati. Dato che JohnOS JohnHome sono due programmi con molte componenti similari, questa libreria racchiude tutto il codice in comune dei due programmi. Questa libreria comprende: </p>

<p>Varie utilità; Gestore dei plugin; Gestore dei dispositivi; Astrazione dei server; </p>

<p>Stato del progettoIl progetto è appena entrato nella seconda fase. Dopo una prima fase di studio e analisi sulla fattibilità del sistema, si è passati al disegno e progettazione della versione 1.0.0 ovvero la versione che permetterà di provare con mano (virtuale per il momento) le possibilità offerte daquesto progetto. Alla conclusione di questa fase si avranno i due programmi, JohnOS e JohnHome perfettamente funzionanti e pronti ad eseguire plugin di ogni tipo o fantasia. </p>

<p>RiferimentiDato che il progetto è in piena fase di sviluppo i riferimenti saranno per lo più per gli sviluppatori per aiutarli a prendere confidenza con i programmi e tecniche utilizzate. Per gli utenti finali invece saranno disponibili immagini, screenshot, video e altro materiale per visualizzare le potenzialità offerte da questo progetto. </p>

<p>Ícones Mágicos: O Kurumin inclui mais de 400 scripts e ferramentas de configuração, organizados no Clica-Aki, o Painel de Controle do Kurumin. Estes scripts incluem funções para instalar novos programas, configurar servidores, configurar placas wireless e softmodems, firewall e muitas outras funções úteis. O que é &quot;complicado&quot; em outras distribuições, pode ser feito com poucos cliques no Kurumin.</p>

<p>Multimídia: O Kurumin é a distribuição Linux com melhor suporte a multimídia. Instale o Suporte a mais formatos de vídeo e suporte a DVDs protegidos através dos ícones mágicos e você conseguirá assistir até mesmo vídeos via streaming através do navegador, usando o KaffeinePlugin.</p>

<p>Suporte a aplicativos Windows: O Kurumin é a distribuição com melhor suporte a programas e jogos Windows, combinando o WMware, Wine, CrossOver Office, Qemu e WineX (Cedega). Você pode escolher qual usar de acordo com a necessidade. Veja mais detalhes aqui: http://www.guiadohardware.net/livros/kurumin/04/</p>

<p>Interface: Ao invés de tentar imitar a interface do Windows, o Kurumin tem uma cara própria, que é ao mesmo tempo familiar e bonita.</p>

<p>Suporte a hardware: O Kurumin inclui um conjunto completo de drivers para modems e lacas wireless. O Kernel 2.6 atualizado faz com que estejam disponíveis versões recentes dos drivers para outros dispositivos.</p>

<p>Documentação e Ajuda: Os recursos disponíveis no Kurumin são explicados com detalhes no Livro &quot;Entendendo o Linux, Guia Prático&quot; (disponível em versão impressa) e no livro &quot;Kurumin Desvendando seus segredos&quot; (lançado em 2004, por isso desatualizado em alguns tópicos), que você pode ler aqui: http://www.guiadohardware.net/livros/kurumin/.</p>

<p>Leia também os Guias Kurumin: Instalando e Kurumin: Configurando o sistema: http://www.guiadohardware.net/guias/</p>

<p>Desenvolvimento: O Kurumin é desenvolvido primariamente por uma única pessoa, mas existe um fórum para discussões técnicas, onde você pode postar dicas, contribuições e sugestões técnicas, o Kurumin Technical (este não é um fórum de suporte, leia as regras do fórum antes de postar). Originalmente o Kurumin foi desenvolvido com base no Knoppix. Atualmente ele utiliza também componentes do Kanotix e outros projetos, além de ser baseado nos pacotes do Debian.</p>

<p>O Kurumin pode ser personalizado, criando novas soluções. Você pode adicionar novos programas, remover alguns dos programas instalados, alterar o visual e configurações, usar outro gerenciador de janelas no lugar do KDE, adicionar novas funções e facilidades através de scripts e assim por diante. Como este processo exige um certo conhecimento técnico, optei por concentrar todas as informações referentes à personalização do CD no livro &quot;Linux Ferramentas Técnicas 2ed., disponível aqui no site, ou em qualquer boa livraria. Além de falar sobre a remasterização do Kurumin, o livro inclui explicações detalhadas sobre a estrutura do sistema, os arquivos de configuração, Kernel e outros componentes, scripts de detecção de hardware e automatização de tarefas, shell script e assim por diante. Enfim, tudo o que você precisa saber para fazer um bom trabalho :).</p>

 summary : <p>Note: this project is no longer active. </p>

<p>This was part of a design project from January to April 2008.  The goal of the project was to design and build a device which would help users navigate on foot without the benefit of sight.   </p>

<p>This was accomplished through a &quot;wand&quot; component consisting of a distance sensor and an accelerometer, and an audio component which would create a virtual sound source at a position corresponding to detected surfaces. </p>

<p>This worked in a rough sense.  Challenges were the accuracy of the distance and wand position sensing, as well as the clarity of the virtual sound source.</p>

 summary : <p>LISSOM (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/rflissom_small.html) is a model of human neocortex (mainly modeled on visual cortex) at a neural column level. The model was developed by Bednar, Choe, Miikkulainen, and Sirosh, at the University of Texas. I made different implementations of the model (with the help of Prof. Bednar), with the aim of porting it to GPU hardware using CUDA by nVidia. Now the library can run up to 9x faster than on modern CPUs. The project also involves usage of multiGPU systems and GPU clusters, to overcome the two big problems we face: </p>

<p>-lack of memory to store the network; </p>

<p>-computing power to simulate the model. </p>

 title : The midibang Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MidiBang arises in the openLab, Nov. 27 2007. During these days, i&#39;m working with Arduino  to make a simple MIDI trigger for a midi drum. </p>

<p>But there is no way for a MIDI program to understand the serial data coming from the USB, so we need an application which takes the serial data, and pass it to an ALSA virtual MIDI device, so other programs can be controlled with our trigger pads :) </p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to use Juce for user interface, since it comes with some ALSA support. And well, to be honest, i&#39;m in love with the user interface look and feel. Moreover, it&#39;s said to be very well programmed, and seems to be an easy development library. MIDI related code it&#39;s simplified with Juce, since it comes with methods to handle that. It will run on GNU/Linux systems, though it should be quite easy to port it to windows or mac. </p>

<p>In short: since Arduino board comes with a FTDI chip, the ftdi driver creates a serial device when Arduino is plugged-in, and this device is called /dev/ttyUSB0 in my Debian Lenny. </p>

<p>So i decided to use a serial library to handle the data from the serial port, and reached libserial (quite old, but i&#39;m not even a newbie in C++, and this one is simple and easy to understand for me). This is my &quot;Hello World&quot; with C++ and GNU/Linux (after some playing with Visual C++ and Dev-C++). </p>

<p>Oh, at the end, but the most important, this project is heavily based upon a similar one developed for MacOS. This inspiring application is called Ardrumo, and you can find it in http://code.google.com/p/ardrumo/</p>

 title : The obdreap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In the search I have made for software interfaces to OBD hardware I have become frustrated in finding one that matches my needs. One package would offer something I like that another did not have only lack a critical component that made it completely worthless to me. </p>

<p>The following is a list of minimum requirements.Language still yet to be determined Python seems to be the platform independent choice, however, deployment requires that Python RTE be installed Java is another viable choice, however, same issue as above C# is the preferred language, however, out of the choices the least platform dependent.      Given the requirement that minimal apis incorporated this will need to be investigated This project will focus on Test Driven Development.  It will begin by developing an application that will use actual data to verify the  created tests.  (emulation) It will continue to create the application that will take the data and log it to a file (translation) It will continue by interfacing the resultant data to communication technology (bluetooth, IrDa, Wifi, etc) (communication) Finally a mobile application will be developed Needs to be very easy to install and deploy, minimal requirements and minimal libraries. Preference given to Windows platforms (the majority). But not complete if only partially supported in Linux. This project stresses reduction in external api requirements if any design requires a hardware module that item will be stubbed out and a platform blind module will be developed inline. Needs it to be &quot;Always On&quot; that means it has 2 modes  ON and not looking for a connection and  ON and looking for a connection. This requirement allows this application to work as a logger and when the hardware is not robust enough to maintain    communication through A testing interface to enhance and encourage developers to add other behavior to this application This requires a method to allow other developers to contribute modules or plugins to this project Whatever language this application is written in it most be coded with a very rudimentary style avoiding complex language specific structures (i.e no generics, no anonymous methods, no  extra apis) This is to insure that if in the future we need to port to another languuage this can be done more easily. A Mobile interface that communicates with a device attached to the OBD interface that allowing specific data items to be displayed in a &quot;heads up fashion&quot; This requirement will be in V2 of this spec The display will be able to be modified by the user so that only the information that she wants will be displayed. A website that allows the user to display and analyze the data and determine ways to benefit fuel efficiency, speed, performance, etc.</p>

 summary : <p>An esoteric C# graphics engine</p>

<p>My goals for the project are to make an engine that: is both real-time and off-line; is implementation and hardware agnostic (yet while using all available hardware acceleration); cross-platform (through Mono) and LGPL. Uncomprimising software design and high extensibility are central themes.
<br/>RadixNine is not tied to the fixed-function graphics pipeline; it can light (using arbitrary lighting engines) and render (using plugable rendering back-ends) objects of arbitrary nature (not just triangle meshes). It is so hardware independant that without a client program knowing anything about a rendered object, the client can &quot;migrate&quot; the object from one RadixNine &quot;render host&quot; to another-- eg: migrating a fractal approximation from a DirectX mesh to an OpenGL render list-- seamlessly between render frames and with full hardware acceleration! It can even switch between traditional rasterization and ray tracing mid-frame and so (eg:) switch from a course aproximation of that fractal to &quot;the real thing&quot; by changing one method call-- inside a scene with traditionally rasterized objects.</p>

 summary : <p>The rallyduino project aims to design both the hardware and software required to build an open source rally computer. To see the system running in a test environment, please checkout the following video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyW1XwZ2ToM </p>

<p>The current version of the rallyduino software contains the following features: </p>

<p>2 independant distance/time/speed counters Tracking of distance/speed in miles or kilometers and can be switched on the fly Count up and down (With appropriate recalculation of average speed etc) Remote control through the use of a Wii &#39;nunchuck&#39; controller Tracks time and average speed along with distance </p>

<p>Currently the software is reasonably specific to the hardware I&#39;m running it on (Though this may change in the future to cater for different Serial-&gt;LCD boards). I plan to put together some diagrams illustrating the components, but until then here is a list of what you will need: </p>

<p>Arduino Diecimila (Though derivatives will almost certainly work as well) A 4x20 HD44780-based LCD Serial LCD adaptor based on Peter Anderson&#39;s command set. These units are available through Peter&#39;s website, Modern Devices or Wulfden OR: An i2c LCD controller compatible with this library http://www.wentztech.com/radio/arduino/files/LCDI2C.html. This is currently experimental, but will likely be the preferred interface in the future A Wii nunchuck (Preferably with an extension cable so you don&#39;t have to mutilate your controller) Some way to connect all the above together (ie breadboard or arduino prototyping shield and a bunch of wire)</p>

 title : The reggen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In VLSI chip design, configuration registers module (shorted as CFG in this project) acts as software/hardware interface by software for runtime operations. All registers are usually encapsulated in an individual module with read/write control logic. Other modules in chip can access registers in this module as needed. Software reads/writes data from/into this module via host interface (such as PCI-Express) to perform runtime operations (such as poll device status, change device state, push new commands, etc).  </p>

<p>Work load of CFG is not the logic design, instead, is the iteration of register defining and updating. Furthermore, software engineers eagerly want a latest clear and pretty list of all registers with name, address, width, function, access type information for software development. On the other hand, Hardware guys are used to updating the RTL code without updating document, in fact no one would update document for one line code changecode. But to software guys, this could lead to useless code since they are facing an out-of-date HW/SW interface.  </p>

<p>reggen is a tool to generate CFG in synthesizable Verilog (or SystemVerilog, future plan) based on a clear list of all registers. CFG module owner only needs to update the list and all other things (RTL, C/C++ header for address, document) are generated automatically. With GNU make, working can be synchronized perfectly between SW and HW.  </p>

<p>Core data for reggen is stored in XML format. Microsoft Excel is used as GUI for XML editing and viewing. An Excel template is included in this project. But for a GPL project, using MS Office is not very good. So future version of this tool will use TCL to construct a dedicated GUI (maybe using Ajax to build an on-line service is also a good idea).</p>

<p>Vize projektuRobot bude tvořen čtyřkolovým podvozkem s diferenciálním zatáčením, postaveným na platformě MOB-03 (HobbyRobot). Elektronika robotu bude tvořit rozhraní mezi hardwarem a programem v PC. Umožní tak programátorovi soustředit se na složitější problémy. </p>

<p>PlanovanaFunkcnost Řídící program v PC bude komunikovat s robotem pomocí bezdrátové technologie ZigBee, nebo obdobné technologie. Program umožní zobrazení stavu senzorů, přímé ovládání robotu (klávesnicí, joystickem), hlavní funkcí programu bude vytvoření mapy místnosti. </p>

<p>Možné využitíZajímavá a motivující pomůcka pro výuku mikroprocesorové techniky, demonstrace činnosti regulátorů, bezdrátového přenosu dat apod. Univerzální platforma pro účast případného školního týmu na robotických soutěžích Atraktivní prezentace školy (vzdělávací veletrhy, den otevřených dveří) Popis částí projektuTento projekt (bakalářská práce) je tvořen třemi částmi: </p>

<p>Moduly budou propojené pomocí sběrnice RS485. Systém tedy bude možné rozšířit o další moduly, případně bude možné již hotové moduly na základě vytvořené dokumentace použít v jiném projektu. </p>

<p>Elektroniku robotu budou tvořit následující moduly: </p>

<p>řídící modul (MainMod) ovládání motorů (MotorControl) modul napájení (PowMod) senzorický modul (SensMod) Řídící program v PCÚkolem řídícího sw bude realizovat inteligentní chování robotu.

 title : The seeker-thermal-pmu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a full system Performance and Thermal profiling tool mainly for the Intel Core Micro-architecture but can be easily extended to other architectures. (Basic support for the AMD Opteron is also provided - Minus the temperature and PMU interrupt support)  </p>

<p>AbstractThere is an abundance of software out there to access the hardware performance counters. Namely, perfctr+PAPI, perfmon2, Vtune(Intel Trademark), Oprofile etc. Very few of them provide sampling features and even few can do full system profiling. But what makes seeker different is that currently one can profile the core temperature data along with the performance counter data and easily extend it to profile other parameters. Seeker comes with an interface document which allows one to write basic modules to manipulate hardware performance counters and hence porting Seeker to other architectures very easy. It currently provides minimal support for the k8 a.k.a. AMD Opteron architectures. This is provided as an example to prove the previous statement. </p>

<p>Seeker is licensed under the GPLv3. I am just a graduate student who likes to hacks the kernel as a hobby. So, this is a summing up of the license: &quot;The piece of software is provided as is without warranty, feel free to use/modify/distribute it. But do not blame me if something goes wrong. If you distribute it, make sure that the copyright is included and GPL still holds recursively&quot;. But as a side note, Email me if you find bugs, I will try hard to fix them, infact send me an email anyway so I know that someone other than me uses this piece of garbled kernel code. </p>

<p>Features1. Timer based profiling </p>

<p>2. Support for multi-processor architectures. (Seeker supports the system as long as linux does -&gt; smp is enabled) </p>

<p>3. Support for PMU Counter based sampling for the x86 architectures - Patches for linux kernel 2.6.18.x and 2.6.24.x are provided. </p>

<p>4. Temperature profiling </p>

<p>5. Can be easily extended to add more devices to sample </p>

<p>6. Log acquisition daemon can be signalled to change log files -&gt; easy to automate </p>

<p>7. Generic data handling and automation scripts are provided. </p>

<p>8. For more subtle features download the package and refer to the README </p>

<p>NOTE: If all you care about is sampling hardware performance counters, then perfmon2 or vtune(Registered Trademark Intel) are better and more robust/stable. </p>

<p>Basic Usagemake </p>

<p>./load sample_freq=F log_ev_masks=MX,XY os_flag=O pmu_intr=P </p>

<p>sample_freq : Take F samples per second, without pmu_intr </p>

<p>sample_freq : Take a sample every time Fixed counter P counts F events. </p>

<p>pmu_intr : If provided, samples are taken every time counter P counts F events. </p>

<p>os_flag : 0(Default) - Count events in user space only. 1 - Count events in both user and  OS space. </p>

<p>log_events : A list of events to monitor. For the core architecture, a max of 2 can be provided.  </p>

<p>log_ev_masks : The mask corrosponding to each of the events provided in log_events.  </p>

<p> For events and their corresponding masks, refer to C2D_EVENTS.pdf (Core micro architecture) or K8_EVENTS.pdf (K8 Architecture). </p>

<p>Now to run the log acquisition daemon, Run the following: </p>

<p>&#39;Scripts/generic_log_dump /dev/seeker_samples /path/to/bin/log &amp;&#39; </p>

<p>This will dump the log in binary format in /path/to/bin/log0 If you feel that an experiment is over, and you need to conduct another one, do the following after waiting for 20 seconds: </p>

<p>&#39;Scripts/send.pl&#39; </p>

<p>This will cause generic_log_dump to shift logs from log0 to log1, then to log2 and so on. And finally, when all the experiments are over: </p>

<p>&#39;Scripts/send.pl -t&#39; </p>

<p>This will cause generic_log_dump to terminate gracefully. </p>

<p>To convert the bin logs to csv logs, do the following: </p>

<p>Scripts/decodelog &lt; /path/to/bin/log &gt; /path/to/csv/log </p>

<p>Now, there are a ton of data handling scripts/applications which perform: Pulling per application data, Linear spline Interpolation, Moving Window averaging, Per sample max/min, csv to tsv conversion, And finally automation scripts to all of the above.</p>

<p>Test Os KernelTest Os kernel is an open source project, founded to provide an educational and research Kernel. It&#39;s designed to be a tiny and very simple kernel with small parts that can be used independently as parts of other kernels. Students can easily read the kernel source and understand it because it contains only the necessary parts of a real kernel, and thus students and researchers can easily use it in their projects. TOS was originally created for educational and research purposes but it can be easily ported to be used as a kernel for embedded systems.  </p>

<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of GNU General Public License (GPL). Test Os is also a part of the Open-ESI initiative (open source programs supported by the High School of Computer Science of Algeria). </p>

<p>GoalsProvide a platform for researchers to implement and test new algorithms, taking advantage of the performance monitor. Provide a simple and very small kernel for students. The best way to understand an Operating system course is to implement and try studied algorithms. It&#39;s a good starting point for those who want to study KERNEL programming. Provide a set of useful libraries and parts that can be used to build a new fully functional kernel.

 summary : <p>Greetings from TooboThis project aims to create an open source software/hardware solution to produce a simple yet useful web companion (described later) using linux and other open source software. </p>

<p>Currently, the definition of web companion is some device which lets the user access favorite web content like streaming radio, online weather, stock ticker, news headlines, webchat, search, maps and directions (to name a few) with the touch of a button. </p>

<p>The speciality of the project is that, it attempts to provide a complete hardware/software solution rather than just a software solution to the problem. This project also strongly emphasizes various levels of hardware abstraction so that different users can customize the same software for their specific hardware needs. Another aspect this project emphasizes is the independent startup and shutdown of various subsystems to save power and help with recovery from critical errors without a complete reboot. In the initial stages, this project would primarily focus on wired internet and in the future phases move on to wireless internet access. </p>

<p>Motivation behind tooboWe all love to listen to online music stations. One shouldn&#39;t have to open up his/her computer to listen to music. Also, some of our folks aren&#39;t experts at using computers. So, if someone wants to voice chat or video chat, they shouldn&#39;t have to open up a computer and fiddle around with the keyboard. It should be done at the touch of a button. </p>

<p>And handy things like weather, picture emails, maps, yellow pages should not need a computer or an expensive toy. Instead a simple gadget like this should be able to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>Wockets Source CodeThis is the code repository for MIT&#39;s Wockets Project. The software consists of a set of libraries that collect data from wireless miniature accelerometers called Wockets. The code is written in C# and is released under an MIT Public License.   The software is organized into 3 components:  </p>

<p>1- The Source Directory (svn/trunk/src): This includes the C# source files that are located under the Source Tab. The source code is organized into multiple subdirectories. Two particularly important subdirectories are src/Wockets that includes the source code for communicating with wockets, decoding and logging accelerometer data and src/WocketsWeka that includes a partially ported and modified version of Weka in C#. </p>

<p>2- The Projects Directory (svn/trunk/projects): This includes the project files for visual studio 2005 for different device platforms (PocketPC and PC). </p>

<p>3- The Bin.zip: The file includes configuration files and external dlls to compile the project in visual studio 2005 and will include the binaries generated during compilation.  </p>

<p>Instructions for Compiling and Running the Wockets CodePrerequisites </p>

<p>1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. The code has not been tested on later versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. </p>

<p>2. SVN Software such as SVN Tortoise.  </p>

<p>3. ActiveSync for Windows XP users. Windows Vista ships with Microsoft Mobile Center and therefore Activesync is not needed. </p>

<p>4. A Windows Mobile phone with Microsoft Bluetooth Stack. We currently do not support Widcomm phones but will add support shortly. </p>

<p>Instructions </p>

<p>1. Install an SVN software such as SVN Tortoise to checkout the wockets source tree. </p>

<p>2. Once the program is installed. Create a local directory on your disk where you can checkout the wockets source tree and projects. </p>

<p>3. Go to the Source Tree Tab  for instructions on how to checkout the project. The project supports 2 user groups: </p>

<p>a. Members: As a member, you can checkout the source tree, modify it and update the svn repository. This access level requires authentication. If you would like to contribute to the source tree, please email either Dr. Stephen Intille or Dr. Fahd Albinali. </p>

<p>b. Non-members: As a non-member, you will be able to checkout the source tree and modify it on your local machine. You won’t be able to commit any changes to the SVN repository. This access level does not require authentication. </p>

<p>4. Use your SVN software to checkout the source tree and project files from the repository. For SVN Tortoise users, you simply need to right-click on the directory that you just created and choose checkout. You will be asked to provide a url for the SVN repository, please use the information listed under the Source Tree Tab. </p>

<p>5. Download the most recent Bin Zip File under the Download Tab. </p>

<p>6. Uncompress the zip file in the root source code directory (i.e. where both src/ and projects/ exist) so that you end up with the src directory, the projects directory and the bin directory at the same level.  </p>

<p>7. To run the Phone version of the code, navigate under the source directory to projects/PPC and click WocketsPPC.sln. The PC version is not fully supported at the moment. </p>

<p>8. Using visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, set the WocketsApplication as the startup project. </p>

<p>9. Connect a phone with a Microsoft Bluetooth Stack to your PC. This should automatically run ActiveSync or Microsoft Mobile Center to connect both your PC and the phone. If you do not have ActiveSync, download it and install it. Users of Windows Vista use Microsoft Mobile Center instead. </p>

<p>10. Compile and Build the code. </p>

<p>11. If your code compiles successfully, you can deploy to the Phone. The code will deploy to /Device/Program Files/Wockets. Once it is deployed, copy the contents of the following folder from your PC bin/NeededFiles to your phone at /Device/Program Files/Wockets/NeededFiles. </p>

<p>12. Before running the code, you will have to edit some configuration files to look for the right wocket. For detailed instructions on how to do that, scroll below and read our  Tips for Running the Code. </p>

<p>Special Instructions for Members1. Don’t Commit Binaries: Microsoft Visual Studio automatically creates many directories when compiling the code. Some of these directories are created within the source tree and may include intermediate object files that can take substantial space and therefore should not be committed to the source tree. To avoid committing object or temporary files to the source tree, please follow these instructions before applying your first commit: </p>

<p>a. First, compile the code on your local machine.  </p>

<p>b. Go to the main bin/ directory (that you unzipped), add it to the ignore list in your SVN program. In SVN Tortoise, this can be done by right clicking on the directory and choosing Ignore List. If you are asked to ignore the directory by extension or by name, choose by name. </p>

<p>c. Go to the PPC projects directory under projects/PPC. Add any subdirectories to the SVN ignore list. </p>

<p>d. Go to the PC projects directory under projects/PC. Add any subdirectories to the SVN ignore list. </p>

<p>e. Go to each project directory under src/ and ignore any subdirectory with the name obj or bin. For instance, ignore src/Wockets/obj/ </p>

<p>2. Keep Project Files and Source Files Separate: We would like to keep our source tree and project files in separate directories. Unfortunately, if you use the Solution Explorer in visual studio to add a file, the file is not added to the right location in the source tree. Instead, it is added to the directory where the project file lies. To maintain source files and project files in separate directories, each time you add a project file,  you HAVE to follow these steps: </p>

<p>a. Add the project file in the solution explorer of Microsoft Visual Studio. </p>

<p>b. Open a file explorer and navigate to /projects directory, you should see a copy of the file that you just added. Move this file to the appropriate location under /src directory. Make sure that the file has been moved and not copied. </p>

<p>c. Open the corresponding project file (under /projects) in a text editor. Search for the file that you just added, and make it point to the new location. </p>

<p>d. Your project will automatically reload in Visual Studio and should point to the new file. (You will see an icon with an arrow next to the filename in the solution explorer) </p>

<p>e. Now you can COMMIT the source tree. </p>

<p>Tips for Running the Code and Common Issues1. Bluetooth Stack: Many popular phones do not have Microsoft Bluetooth stacks but rather Widcomm stacks. At the moment, we do not support Widcomm but are planning to add support in the near future. Make sure that you are running the code on a platform that runs a Microsoft stack. </p>

<p>2. Wockets Configurations: To run the code, you need at least 1 wocket and you need to configure the software to look for it. After running the code, you will be prompted to choose a sensor configuration. The list that is displayed is generated from bin/NeededFiles/Master/WocketsControllers.xml.  This XML file points to different wockets configurations such as: </p>

<p>	Demo  3 Wockets
<br/>	3 Wockets.
<br/>	SensorData5.xml
<br/>3. To modify the configuration for the above element you need to modify SensorData5.xml. The file can be found at bin/NeededFiles/SensorConfigurations/SensorData5.xml.  </p>

<p>4. An example of this file with 1 wocket is shown below: </p>

<p>	
<br/>					</p>

<p>	</p>

<p>	
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>		
<br/>	</p>

<p>5. There are three important XML elments in the above file: </p>

<p>a. Receivers: This lists the number of reception channels that the configuration requires. Because wockets use Bluetooth and it is a point to point protocol, each wocket has to define one receiver element with the following parameters: </p>

<p>i. ID: Receivers has to be assigned unique incremental ids starting from 0. For example, if you have 2 wockets, you will define 2 receiver elements with ids 0 and 1. </p>

<p>ii. Type: The type of the reception protocol has to be RFCOMM since the wockets use RFCOMM on top of Bluetooth to exchange data with other devices. </p>

<p>iii. Mac Address and PIN: You need to make sure that the MAC address and PINs are correct. </p>

<p>iv. Other Options: are currently not used but will be used in the near future, so you should keep them as they are for the moment. </p>

<p>b. Decoders: This lists the number of decoders needed to decode wockets data. In theory, you can have 1 decoder for multiple wockets but at the moment, we require that each wocket has its own decoder. Again, each decoder has to have an ID and it should be unique and incremental from 0. For example, if you have 2 wockets, you would have 2 decoders with IDs 0 and 1. </p>

<p>c. Sensors: This lists the number of wockets that you have in the setup. Each wocket should be of class Wockets and should have a unique incremental ID from 0. Importantly, the wocket should point to its Receiver and Decoder in its element using their IDs.  SR is the sampling rate which is approximately 65 Hz and Calibration are values that allow us to reconstruct the sensitivity curves for each wocket. </p>

 title : The abanq-mods Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Abanq-mods¿Que es Abanq?Abanq, es un software ERP (Planificador de Recursos Empresariales) creado por Infosial. </p>

<p>Abanq es la evolución de Facturalux. Infosial inicialmente creo Facturalux como un software de facturación con algunos añadido, pero al convertirse en un ERP lo renombró a Abanq. </p>

<p>Una de las principales caracteristicas de este ERP es que es Software Libre y se distribuye bajo licencia GPL. Lo cual creo que debemos agradecerselo eternamente a Infosial. </p>

<p>¿Que es Abanq-mods?Como Abanq es Software Libre, entre otras cosas podemos compartirlo y modificarlo. Este lugar pretende ser un sitio donde la gente que queremos desarrollar, modificar y compartir tanto Abanq como sus modulos, podamos hacerlo. </p>

<p>¿De donde nace Abanq-mods?Inicialmente Infosial los foros que tenía para el soporte y desarrollo eran de pago. Así que juntando varias iniciativas y aprovechando Google Groups se creo un grupo independiente de Infosial llamado facturalux. Para adaptarse al nuevo nombre del programa, se creo un nuevo grupo en Google Groups llamado Abanq. En este grupo se vio el interes de personas por compartir codigo y modificar este. Asi que aprovechando Google Code se creo esta web. </p>

 title : The libedi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EDI is a collection of message transmission formats used primarily in electronic business-to-business (B2B) transactions where the implementation pre-dates the use of an XML-based format. </p>

<p>EDI specifications exist for a whole range of transactions, most covering those needed to implement ERP in association with suppliers. </p>

<p>libedi aims to be as generic and flexible as possible, because each of the main EDI variants in widespread usage (EDIFACT, TRADACOMS, ANSI ASC X12, ODETTE) have different syntax rules. libedi does not concern itself with the transmission or reception of EDI interchanges themselves, simply with parsing them into an easily-digestible form, or generating them programatically. At present, libedi only performs a “low level” parse of an interchange: the result is a structure containing one or more segments, each containing one or more data elements (of which the first is treated as the segment&#39;s tag), in the order that they appear in the message.  No attempt at present is made to produce a higher-level representation of the interchange based upon knowledge of the EDI variant in use. For example, libedi doesn&#39;t know that an UN/EDIFACT message is wrapped with UNB…UNZ segments, or that a functional group is wrapped with UNG…UNE segments. As far as libedi is concerned, there&#39;s simply a UNB segment, followed by a UNG segment, (followed by a UNH segment and so on), and then a UNT segment, a UNE segment, and finally a UNZ segment. This is likely to change in the future, however. libedi contains no support itself for reading and writing XML-based representations of EDI interchanges, but can be used to facilitate the development of software which does. Given the level at which libedi operates, it&#39;s unlikely that the addition of this as a feature would be useful currently: any representation produced by libedi would simply be the same segment and tag structure encapsulated within XML nodes, when what would generally be required would be an XML representation of the information contained within the interchange, structured in a way most suited to the type of information being represented (that is, for example. a purchase order would have a different XML document structure to a flight availability enquiry). It&#39;s conceivably possible to extend libedi such that it has support for (and knowledge of) specific EDI interchange types, but this can only be accomplished if the relevant format and structure information can be expressed in a generic and extensible manner (for example, something not dissimilar to XML Schema Definitions).</p>

 summary : <p>Em uma primeira fase do projeto, visamos disponibilizar em nosso idioma nativo o maior número possível de documentações existentes no projeto oficial, tornando assim mais simples o processo de estudo, adequação e implantação do Openbravo™ entre os usuários brasileiros. </p>

<p>Após o trabalho de tradução atingir uma certa maduridade, pretende-se criar em paralelo uma linha de análise e desenvolvimento afim de possibilitar a adequação do Openbravo™ para particularidades contábeis, fiscais e outras existentes em nosso país. </p>

<p>Será um trabalho muito grande, e por isso contamos com a adesão da comunidade em geral, desde desenvolvedores até pessoas que não trabalham na área de TI, mas que possam contribuir com tradução, opiniões, avaliações do que está feito, etc. </p>

<p>Acreditamos que em breve muitas empresas nacionais, a exemplo do que já acontece na Europa, possam estar desfrutando deste promissor ERP Open Source, e, agradeçemos também pelo seu esforço por ajudar-nos a tornar isto real.</p>

 summary : <p>Начата разработка плана развития проекта Openbravo POS ru на 2010 год. Прошу высказывать свои взгляды на развитие данного проекта в комментариях на странице 3rdStage. </p>

<p>8 и 9 апреля 2010 года в Санкт-Петербурге состоится ежегодная конференция Sun Tech Days, которую корпорация Sun Microsystems проводит по всему миру уже более 10 лет. </p>

<p>ОписаниеПроект по поддержки разработчиков Openbravo POS, открытой системы управления торговыми терминалами на русском языке. Все разработчики систем на базе данного программного продукта приглашаются к обсуждению в разделе Issues. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Примеры локализации интерфейса пользователя на русский язык. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Примеры реализации поддержки оборудования с локализованной версией Openbravo POS. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Примеры изменений исходного кода, скриптов и отчётов Openbravo POS для интеграции локальной специфики бизнес-процессов. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Примеры работы с данными в Openbravo POS средствами внешних приложения. </p>

<p>Этапы работыI этап - 2008 годРаботы над данным проектом начаты в апреле 2008 года. Основной целью работы на  первом этапе данного проекта было перевести текст интерфейса и разместить его в репозитарие проекта. Эти цели были достигнуты. Описание работ на I этапе помещено в архив проекта. </p>

<p>II этап - 2009 годС марта 2009 года цели проекта были скорректированы на базе опыта работы с системой на протяжении 11 месяцев, а также в предверие выхода версии Openbravo POS 2.30. Основной целью работы на  втором этапе стала концентрация на задачах по поддержки внедрения на территории бывшего СССР. В данный момент это является основной целью работы над данным проектом. </p>

<p>III этап - 2010 годНачата разработка плана развития проекта на 2010 год. Рабочий вариант целей и задач развития проекта на III этапе. </p>

<p>Цели II этапаГолосуем за включение Openbravo POS в релизы Ubuntu </p>

<p>Целью II этапа проекта является поддержка разработчиков Openbravo POS на территории бывшего СССР. </p>

<p>В дальнейшем новые версии файлов переводов будут публиковаться в репозитарие Сообщества Openbravo. Обсудить перевод вы можете в форуме Сообщества. Вся Wiki-документация на русском языке будет публиковаться в русском разделе Openbravo wiki. </p>

<p>ЗадачиРаботы по внедрению Openbravo POS на территории бывшего СССР показали, что поддерживаемое по-умолчанию в Openbravo POS не достаточно распространено, чаще всего при построении комплексов автоматизации торговых точек используется оборудование производства России, Китая или Болгарии. Так же на сегодняшний день в поддерживаемых Openbravo POS протоколах не реализованы возможности работы с кириллицей. Исходя из этого задачами проекта на II этапе являются: </p>

<p>публикация методик разработки модулей в Openbravo POS для подключению не поддерживаемого POS-оборудования;  добавление символов кириллицы в модули для оборудования уже поддерживаемого Openbravo POS; создание на основе стабильной версии Openbravo POS, версии для использования на территории бывшего СССР и размещения исходных кодов данной версии в репозитарии проекта; интеграция Openbravo POS с другими системами автоматизации, в особенности с базирующими на комплексе 1С; внедрения БД Openbravo POS в среду Pentaho; разработка модулей и скриптов улучшающих работу с Openbravo POS в региональных условиях; ведение переговоров с командой разработчиков, с целью включения результатов проектов в основную ветвь исходного кода проекта Openbravo POS. </p>

<p>СтруктураВсе рабочие материалы проекта распространяются в соответствии с условиями лицензионного соглашения GNU GPL v2. Сейчас рассматриваются возможности распространения исходных кодов на условиях GNU LGPL v2.1 или GNU GPL v3. </p>

<p>РесурсыНа II этапе базовой версией для проекта является Openbravo POS 2.20. </p>

<p>В качестве первоначальной версии представленных материалов используется исходный код разработанные ИТ службой компании ТОО &quot;Норд Трейдинг&quot;, Республика Казахстан. Дальнейшая работа над проектом будет производится силами данной компании, а так же всех тех компаний и частных лиц присоединившимся в будущем к данному проекту.  </p>

<p>В качестве основного средства разработки используется кросс-платформенная система разработки на Java NetBeans. </p>

<p>В качестве средств коммуникационной и информационной поддержки проекта используются службы порталов Google Code, Wiki OpenBravo, SourceForge.net. </p>

 title : The anaglyphmaker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>After visiting NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratories websites for the Mars Rover with my daughter, I got interested in the process of creating red/blue 3D images. After doing some research on these 3D images called &quot;anaglyph images,&quot; and not finding any Mac programs for generating them that I liked, I decided to write a program to create them. Anaglyph Maker is the result; it is a simple application for combining &quot;stereo pair&quot; images (images taken of the same subject from two positions a few inches apart on the same horizontal plane) into a single anaglyphic image. There are options in the program for generating both grayscale and color anaglyphs, but to generate a color anaglyph, your source images must be color. You can also save the raw stereo pairs into an Anaglyph Maker document so that you can load it later.  </p>

<p>There is some online help available that will help you learn to take &quot;stereo pair&quot; images, and will also take you on a short tour of using Anaglyph Maker.  It also contains information to help you find the things you will need to make and view the anaglyph images.</p>
 title : The appcaster Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project has been moved hereAppcaster + OpenFeedbackThe Appcaster open source project is actually two projects working together. </p>

<p>Appcaster is a PHP management console for indie Mac developers. It&#39;s a complete solution for selling your Mac applications on your website. It manages your product&#39;s revision history, generates Appcast feeds for Sparkle, stores your downloads in Amazon S3, processes orders via PayPal, and generates license files for your users using the AquaticPrime framework. If your application uses SparklePlus, Appcaster can track and chart your users&#39; demographics, too. OpenFeedback is a Cocoa framework which allows your users to submit bug reports, feature requests, and ask support questions from directly within your application. It can store feedback in Appcaster or connect to your own custom server-side script. And, like Sparkle, OpenFeedback can be integrated into your application in just a few minutes - no code required. More about AppcasterAs described in this blog post, shortly after I released VirtualHostX I realized I needed an easy way to manage orders and create Sparkle appcast feeds - Appcaster was my solution. Initially built over a weekend, I&#39;ve continued to improve and expand it&#39;s capabilities during the last year. I&#39;m releasing it as an open source project so other small-time Mac developers might benefit from it. </p>

<p>Feature OverviewRequires PHP5 and MySQL 4 Can manage multiple products Tracks releases for each product and generates the appropriate Appcast feed. Appcast feeds support md5 hashes to verify your file&#39;s integrity. Stores product downloads in Amazon S3 for reliability. Think that&#39;s overkill? Read this. Processes orders via PayPal&#39;s IPN system. Generates license files using AquaticPrime. Sends licenses to users in a template-based email. View order history / details. Re-send license files to users with one click. Manually create orders. Collects SparklePlus demographics and graphs them using the Google Charts API. Collects user feedback submitted via OpenFeedback. Most data is available as an RSS feed. Built using the Simple PHP Framework. More about OpenFeedbackThe idea for OpenFeedback came after seeing Cultured Code&#39;s clever solution in their task management application - Things. I thought their implementation was a terrific idea and asked if I could recreate it as a Cocoa framework for other developers to use. They very kindly said yes and - voilà! - OpenFeedback was born. </p>

<p>Feature OverviewCocoa framework written in Objective-C Easy to integrate into your app - no code required. Collects support questions, bug reports, and feature requests. Can submit data to any web server via a simple POST request.  </p>

<p>So...While I&#39;m calling this a 1.0 release, Appcaster (and particularly OpenFeedback) are still very much beta in spirit. I&#39;ve been using Appcaster for almost a year without any issues, and OpenFeedback has been rolled into the latest release of my own Mac software - so I consider them stable. Still, suggestions, bugs, and code contributions are very much welcome. Please don&#39;t hesitate to file issues in our bug tracker.</p>

 title : The cocoa-sshtunnel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SSHTunnel  </p>

<p>What is SSHTunnel ?SSHTunnel is an OS X application that allows you to easily create SSH tunnels from your computer to a remote host (like a website) through a SSH server. This SSH tunnel can bypass the firewall rules in a secure way. So if you are at work, and you can&#39;t access YouTube, just create a SSH tunnel, and your ready to go! </p>

<p>And on the next version ?The next version will be not a graphical and logical evolution of sessions. I will focus on SSH security, by adding a support of system Keychain to store passwords, and allow the keys creation and support for servers. This next release should be available very very soon (I&#39;ve play around with OS X authentication server and I&#39;ve already do the key management on a very old version of SSHTunnel). Stay tuned! </p>

<p>News(12/11/2008) Hey, long time no see!Just to tell to my dear users that I&#39;m not dead. I&#39;m working on the integration of the open source tool called proxytunnel, to be able to really bypass all kind of firewall. And it works! Stay tuned ;) </p>

<p>(23/08/2008) Big Update in progressThe released version 1.5, will be strange if you do not reset to default factory. To do this open SSHTunnel Preferences (Cmd + &quot;,&quot; ) and then choose &quot;Reset the factory presets&quot; It will quit SSHTunnel. You just have to relaunch it. </p>

<p>(23/08/2008) Big Update in progressAs I said, here are the new version of SSHTunnel. See change log to know what&#39;s new. I think you should see it, because there were a lot of changes! </p>

<p>(22/08/2008) Big Update in progressTime to change. The next version of SSHTunnel will have a lot of new features, like global proxification, ability to simply launch shell on the SSHServer, a task bar menu to control the application, a Time Machine like button to start sessions (useless so indispensable!), a smart new view to organize the sessions, ability to to autostart some sessions at launch. Here are some screenshots of the application. You can download the development version to try it if you know how to compile a software. Else be patient, it will coming soon! </p>

<p>(18/08/2008) SSHTunnel on Apple.comYou can now download and follow SSHTunnel from the Apple official website at the following address : http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/networking_security/sshtunnel.html. </p>

<p>(07/08/2008) SSHTunnel on SoftpediaSSHTunnel is on Sofpedia : http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Network-Admin/SSHTunnel.shtml. </p>

<p>Minimum requirementsTo use SSHTunnel, you need at least : </p>

<p>Mac OS &gt;= 10.5 ; A valid internet connection ; If you meet problems with incoming tunnels, you should deactivate your Mac OS Firewall. </p>

<p>Author notePlease remember that this program is a free software and comes with no guarantees. I&#39;m alone to develop this application and this is not my main activity so please do not hesitate to report issues in the appropriate tabs. </p>

 summary : <p>Cocoa Barcodes is a set of classes (and a test application) for generating two-dimensional barcodes. It supports many of the more common one-dimensional linear barcodes in use today, allows you to export a barcode as a TIFF, EPS, or PDF image, to copy the barcode image to the pasteboard, or to drag it to any other application that accepts standard OS X PDF data from the pasteboard, including TextEdit. You can also print barcodes directly to any supported printer. Please note that you may not be able to create readable barcodes at all bar widths allowed by a specification. For example, Code 3 of 9 allows a bar width of as small as 7.5 mils, but I haven&#39;t had much luck going smaller than 13 mils on ink jet printers. </p>

 title : The erlymate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Erlang server as TextMate plugin, native client (command line utility written in C) and a collection of TextMate commands, snippets and templates.  </p>

<p>What is this good for ?The Erlang server-as-textmate-plugin and native client will allow to write in Erlang additional TextMate functionality such as compiling Erlang source code, reloading, refactoring, integration with erlware, etc. </p>

<p>Current Features:Ctrl-H: Documentation lookup (HTML popup) for function at current caret position (or main documentation index if caret is on whitespace). Implementation details:Instead of the original and much simpler approach of using escripts for commands attached to key bindings this approach has been chosen, where the command now is written as shell script and a native client interacts with an Erlang VM which runs in the background and is capable of keeping state between client requests.  Other advantages: </p>

<p>Significantly faster than escripts (no VM startup delay) No Erlang source code anymore in the TextMate embedded Command Editor, just small and simple shell scripts see example below for Ctrl-H (edoc lookup): </p>

<p>OUTPUT=`$ERLYMATE help $ERLANG_DOC`</p>

<p>if [ &quot;$OUTPUT&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]; then
<br/>   echo &quot;no edoc found&quot;
<br/>else 
<br/>   exit_show_html &quot;$OUTPUT&quot;
<br/>fiToDo:fix build command (was the first feature which worked, but is currently broken) integrate an interactive erlang shell Use tokenizer from Wrangler instead of erl_scan.erl (it adds column position) replace the native command line utility with a Cocoa Version which nicely integrates into the XCode project for the Cocoa TextMate plugin History:See at: http://www.rsaccon.com/search/label/textmate </p>

<p>Project status:Not ready for public use yet (e.g.: the code currently contains hardcoded values specific to the authors development environment, so you need to be familiar with all technologies involved to make it work for you ...) </p>

 title : The pybrewery Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PyBreweryPython library for controlling an automated brewery.   </p>

<p>Current DevelopmentCurrently the brewery uses a Arduino for the I/O.  You can also use a couple of Velleman K8055 IO boards.   Other devices will be supported in the future, but unsupported boards can be used if you write a driver for it that implements the interface that is defined in this project.   </p>

<p>The GUI in this project is up in the air, but GUI can be anything, included a web-based application, or an iPhone app, which I have started (see http://code.google.com/p/pybrewery/source/browse/#svn/guis/iPhone/Robot.) </p>

<p>Usage Example
<br/>&quot;Pyrobot.brewery is being developed as a way to brew beer.  It is just a
<br/>collection of tanks, and the tanks hold devices.  The devices respond to
<br/>messages from the pyrobot.notification system.  For this example I&#39;m
<br/>going to make a system that only has one tank, and that tank has four
<br/>devices - a thermometer, a valve (represents a solenoid valve that is
<br/>used to fill the tank), a burner, and a level indictator (represents a device that
<br/>monitors how much liquid is in the tank).&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; from pyrobot.brewery.devices import Thermometer, LevelIndicator, ValveSwitch, Burner
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; from pyrobot.brewery.tests.mock_driver import MockDriver</p>

<p>&quot;The MockDriver class is a fake i/o device, but for a real brewery it
<br/>would be a python class that follows the api defined by
<br/>pyrobot.drivers.interfaces.IDriver.  This project has drivers defined
<br/>for an Arduio, and a velleman k8055.  Currently I am using an Arduino
<br/>Mega for all hardware interaction.  If you want to use something else,
<br/>all you have to do is write your own.</p>

<p>The easiest way to define your setup is with a dictionary.  Here is the
<br/>one for this example.&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; definition = {
<br/>    ...     &#39;io_device&#39;: {
<br/>    ...         &#39;class&#39;: MockDriver,
<br/>    ...         &#39;kw&#39; : {},
<br/>    ...         },
<br/>    ...     &#39;tanks&#39; : {
<br/>    ...         &#39;my_tank&#39; : {
<br/>    ...             &#39;input_devices&#39;: {
<br/>    ...                 &#39;thermometer&#39;: {
<br/>    ...                     &#39;class&#39;: Thermometer,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;channel&#39;: 0,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;calibration_data&#39;: None,
<br/>    ...                     },
<br/>    ...                 &#39;level_indicator&#39; : {
<br/>    ...                     &#39;class&#39;: LevelIndicator,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;channel&#39; : 1,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;calibration_data&#39; : [[0, 0.0], [255, 12.0]],
<br/>    ...                     },
<br/>    ...                 },
<br/>    ...             &#39;output_devices&#39; : {
<br/>    ...                 &#39;fill_valve&#39; : {
<br/>    ...                     &#39;class&#39;: ValveSwitch,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;channel&#39; : 2,
<br/>    ...                     },
<br/>    ...                 &#39;burner&#39; : {
<br/>    ...                     &#39;class&#39;: Burner,
<br/>    ...                     &#39;channel&#39; : 3,
<br/>    ...                     },
<br/>    ...                 },
<br/>    ...                 },
<br/>    ...             }
<br/>    ...         }
<br/>    ...     }</p>

<p>&quot;Now, just pass the definition to the brewery factory.&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; from pyrobot.brewery import Factory
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; factory = Factory(brewery_def = definition)
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; brewery = factory.brewery</p>

<p>&quot;Since this brewery uses a fake io device, we must manipulate it by hand
<br/>to simulate real temperature changes, etc.  The brewery is callable, and
<br/>the __call__ method takes a method as its argument.  So I will make a
<br/>simple method that fills the tank with 10.0 liters of water, then heats
<br/>the water to 80 degrees C.&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_method = [
<br/>    ...     (&#39;fill my_tank&#39;, {&#39;volume&#39;: 10.0}),
<br/>    ...     (&#39;wait&#39;, {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;my_tank target volume reached&#39;}),
<br/>    ...     (&#39;heat my_tank&#39;, {&#39;temperature&#39;: 80.0}),
<br/>    ...     ]</p>

<p>&quot;A method is just a list of messages.  The devices respond to the
<br/>messages.  Each tank in the system must have a unique name in order for
<br/>the devices of the tank to respond to the messages for the tank.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make sure the fill valve isn&#39;t on&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;fill_valve&#39;].state
<br/>    False</p>

<p>&quot;Now, start the method:&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; brewery(my_method)</p>

<p>&quot;Since the first part of the method fills the tank, then that device must
<br/>be on.&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;fill_valve&#39;].state
<br/>    True</p>

<p>&quot;Now I will simulate water going into the tank.&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; io_device = factory.io_device
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(213):
<br/>    ...     io_device.analog_channels[1] += 1
<br/>    ...     brewery.notification_center.post_message(message = &#39;new brew cycle&#39;)
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; brewery.notification_center.post_message(message = &#39;new brew cycle&#39;)</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print &#39;%.01f&#39; % brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;level_indicator&#39;].value
<br/>    10.0
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;fill_valve&#39;].state
<br/>    False</p>

<p>&quot;The tank now has 10.0 liters in it.  The method says that it should now
<br/>be heating the tank up:&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;burner&#39;].state
<br/>    True</p>

<p>&quot;Once again, I must fake the heating of the tank:&quot;</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(80):
<br/>    ...     io_device.analog_channels[0] += 1
<br/>    ...     brewery.notification_center.post_message(message = &#39;new brew cycle&#39;)
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; brewery.notification_center.post_message(message = &#39;new brew cycle&#39;)</p>

<p>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print &#39;%.01f&#39; % brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;thermometer&#39;].value
<br/>    80.0
<br/>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print brewery.tanks[&#39;my_tank&#39;].devices[&#39;burner&#39;].state
<br/>    False</p>

<p>&quot;Hooray!  The tank is now filled and heated.  A complete brew system
<br/>would contain more tanks and a brew method would do more stuff.  See
<br/>pyrobot.brewery.definitions.default for the default setup, and see
<br/>pyrobot.brewery.methods.brew for the default brew method.&quot;</p>

<p>A description of the view and its workings can be found on my blog. </p>

<p>Changes 17/01/09Updated the project layout to make svn:external easy, without importing the demo app. Minor bug fixes and changes. Changes 4/11/08The view now supports the animated addition, insertion and removal of views from the outline view. TLGradientView has been made friendlier to subclassing by changing the way the fill gradient is selected. API additions, for example, a view owned by an NSViewController can be added to the outline view using a single method call. Changing the height of a detail view to accommodate a change in the content now causes the subviews of the outline view to alter their origins so nothing is clipped. The TLDisclosureBar now allows any arbitrary NSView to be added to the right-hand side via the -accessoryView property. So now you can put a button, or anything you like there. The resizing behaviour of the view has been improved so the label text progressively truncates as the width of the view is reduced.    </p>
