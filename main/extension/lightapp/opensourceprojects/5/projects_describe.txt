 title : The colibri-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Colibri-JavaColibri-Java is an implementation of Formal Concept Analysis in Java. Formal concept analysis is an algebraic theory for binary relations , which can be represented as cross tables. It identifies all maximal rectangles in such a table; these rectangles from a hierarchy, the so-called concept lattice. The concept lattice gives insight into the original cross table. </p>

<p>The implementation of formal concept analysis is designed as a library but includes a small demo application that computes the concept lattice for a relation read from a file. </p>

<p>Overview colibri/    Java implementation </p>

<p> doc/        Papers </p>

<p>The doc/ directory contains Daniel Götzmann&#39;s Bachelor Thesis (in German) about this implementation. In addition, a paper by Christian Lindig explains the idea how to use formal concept analysis to mine data for rules and exceptions from these rules. The implementation provides iterators for this purpose. </p>

<p>See AlsoA similar library like this but implemented in Objective Caml can be  found at http://code.google.com/p/colibri-ml/. An older and less advanced implementation in C can be found at http://code.google.com/p/colibri-concepts/.</p>

 title : The currentcost Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CurrentCost (http://www.currentcost.com) monitors allow you to monitor your home electricity usage. </p>

<p>You can connect a serial cable to them to get the data out of them in an XML format. </p>

<p>This project contains Perl, Python, C# and Java code that will parse the data for you. </p>

<p>Note that data comes out of CurrentCost meters in the form of a relative description of your electricity usage. </p>

<p>E.g. you used this much electricity 2 hours ago </p>

<p>The code stored here not only reads the data from the meter, but also parses it and converts it into an absolute description of your electricity usage. </p>

<p>E.g. you used this much electricity at 1pm on 12th July </p>

<p>Notes:  The Python code now supports both the Classic and the CC128 CurrentCost monitors The C# sample supports the CC128 CurrentCost monitors </p>

<p>The latest version of the code is all available using SVN from http://code.google.com/p/currentcost/source/browse/#svn/trunk </p>

<p>Note: The Perl CurrentCost code is different to the code provided for other languages. Unlike the Java, Python and C#, it does not parse the history data. Instead, it is intended to read the CurrentCost data and publish some of it to a messaging system on the Internet so it can be graphed and viewed. The messaging system is the IBM MQ Telemetry Transport, useful, for example, for projects using Really Small Message Broker for home automation. </p>

<p>A related project http://code.google.com/p/currentcostgui/ also draws graphs using the parsed CurrentCost data</p>

 title : The gstreamer-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An unofficial/alternative set of java bindings for the gstreamer multimedia framework. </p>

<p>Please use the gstreamer-java google group to discuss using gstreamer-java or to ask any questions. </p>

<p>Although gstreamer is commonly associated with the gnome desktop, gstreamer itself, and these bindings are portable across operating systems. </p>

<p>The current release is known to run on MacOSX, Linux and Windows. Before using gstreamer-java - and especially before opening issues against gstreamer-java - try to run your pipelines using the Gstreamer gst-launch command-line utility directly. </p>

<p>Please note: this is not an easy-to-use multimedia framework for beginners.  It currently requires people to both know the java language, and be familiar with the gstreamer framework (or be prepared to apply things from tutorials on gstreamer programming in other languages (e.g. python or C#) to the java bindings).</p>
 title : The gwt-rolodex Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryThis widget displays a stack of images that you can flick through like a rolodex or a card deck. It uses gwt&#39;s deferred binding for the image generation and lightweight animation to create a fast and smooth experience in all supported browsers. Check out the HelpMovieDemo and FlipBookDemo demos. </p>

<p>UsageUse gwt 1.4 Download the latest version of this widget and place it within the classpath of your project.  Add the following line to your module xml (see an exampleModuleXml   Create a subinterface or subclass of RolodexCardBundle Grab your stack of images (you&#39;ll get the best results from images that are roughly the same medium size) and place them in the same package space as your RolodexCardBundle. Create a method for each card just like you do with a gwt ImageBundle except they must return a RolodexCard instead of an AbstractImagePrototype. Check out an exampleRolodexCardBundle (although you don&#39;t have to implement the getRolodexCards method, doing so allows you to define the order of your cards since the default is alphabetical). Note that you will usually need to specify a floor color via an @gwt.floorColor tag in your RolodexCardBundle unless your background happens to be black. This will help the reflections look correct. Within your module entry point, create your RolodexCardBundle and pass it in to a RolodexPanel instance. Check out an exampleModuleEntryPoint. Note that you can add click listeners directly to the cards returned from your methods. The above example also shows how you could use an EventPreview to provide key mappings for the widget. One more thing: As of version 1.1 if you have JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) installed, then this widget will look much better. JAI comes pre-installed on mac 10.4 and greater, but for windows and linux you can grab JAI from sun: https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html#Release_builds If you don&#39;t have JAI, then this widget will gracefully downgrade (I love that term) to using the default rendering technique. </p>

 summary : <p>What is YAMVIA?YAMVIA is - as the name is giving you a hint - another approach struggling with the perfidies that visualization of large Movie-Databases come along with. YAMVIA is performed by students of the University of Tampere, Finland in the course Information Visualization Project Work. The YAMVIA project was previously ran under the name &quot;GMD - Global Movie Database&quot;, but as the project emerged we recognized that we have to choose a more appropriate name in order to the challenges that occured.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Problem StatementToday the movie structure in Hollywood - and mostly all over the world - is producing movies at a rapid pace, which makes it nearly impossible for a common person to keep up with the large amount of new releases and the bulk of previous ones. The YAMVIA is an effort to visually represent any information related to the movies. YAMVIA also aims to normalize the complexity of currently available data dilemma. </p>

<p>Currently information and meta data on movies is very descriptive in nature. We can through multiple review and illustrations gather information that can be termed meaningful. This extensive searching process makes it very difficult for a common user to compare and contrast similar information or to extract relevant information through the loads of irrelevant data. In order to that we decided to follow the well known proverb: &quot;Keep it Simple and Straightforward!&quot; </p>

<p>We, from the very start want a visual representative structure, that had simplicity and practicality in view; rather than a complex and attractive outlook. </p>

<p>Technical DetailsProgramming LanguageYAMVIA is written in Java. We used the Java SE 1.5 SDK provided by SUN MICROSYSTEMS. The reason for that was to provide an application that is portable, as the development team consists of 3 persons using three different operating systems. </p>

<p>Visualization ToolkitThe toolkit that was used for visualizing the data is called PreFuse. PreFuse is a set of software tools for creating rich interactive data visualizations. According to PreFuse.org, the original PreFuse toolkit provides a visualization framework for the Java programming language. PreFuse supports a rich set of features for data modeling, visualization, and interaction. It provides optimized data structures for tables, graphs, and trees, a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support for animation, dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity. PreFuse is written in Java, using the Java 2D graphics library, and is easily integrated into Java Swing applications or web applets. PreFuse is licensed under the terms of a BSD license, and can be freely used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. </p>

<p>Database SystemThe System that was used for manipulating and accessing the movie data is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It is released under a BSD-style license and is thus free software. As with many other open-source programs, PostgreSQL is not controlled by any single company, but relies on a global community of developers and companies to develop it. </p>

<p>DataThen there was the question on what kind of Data-Set we should use for YAMVIA. According to its benefits it comes along with we have chosen to use the InfoVizContest 2007 Data tha can be downloaded here. The data is provided in an quite accessible XML format and contains information about 20203 Movies and 149397 involved persons. The data was collected from IMdB and contains all the movies that have been released between 2000 and 2006. </p>

<p>InstallationA detailed description and step by step instructions about how you can setup an appropriate environment to run the application can be found in the installation guide in the wiki.</p>

 title : The java-common-utilities Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PurposeThe purpose of the Java Utilities project is to create a set of standard Java utility libraries to extend the Java 1.6 default class library without introducing other external dependencies. Often when writing Java, lots of the same boilerplate code is written to work with files, I/O streams, XML, Logging, collections, etc. The goal of this project is to simplify the use of the standard API and reduce the amount of boilerplate code developers need to write.  </p>

<p>GoalsThe Java Utilities project will not contain any dependencies on external libraries not included in the standard Java 6 API. The purpose of this library is to enhance the standard Java API without introducing external dependencies (other than this one). It is an annoyance to find a useful library (as this one hopes to be) only to discover it is dependent on a gazillion other libraries. The Java Utilities project will follow the standard Java coding conventions set by Sun in http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html The Java Utilities project will have complete Javadoc documentation for all classes. The documentation will be complete down to the private (developer) level. The Java Utilities project will have a complete unit test suite (tested through JUnit) that will be exercised before each release. The Java Utilities project will use a license such that its use is not limited.</p>

<p>DescriptionFishing is a 2D skill game. You can see the level from the side, which has 2 parts: water and air divided by the water surface. Your task is to control a boat floating on the surface, and catch as many fish as you can. You can move the boat horizontally – left/right on the surface, and you can move your fishing net vertically – up/down. The fishes comes from both left and right, and they swim through the scene. Once a fish leaves the scene it’s considered as a “missed fish”. Game ends when you miss 10 fishes. </p>

<p>As time goes by during the game, catching fishes will get more and more difficult: fishes get faster, more fish can swim through the scene at a time, the waves of the surface and their drifting effect grow bigger and bigger. </p>

<p>You can move the boat and the net with the cursor keys, and you can pause the game at any time with the space. By pressing F1 you get a little help.</p>

 summary : <p>ImageSeams - Java Based GPL Seam CarvingThe ImageSeams command line tool as well as the GUI tool are based on the paper of Avidan, S. &amp; Shamir, A:. Seam carving for content-aware image resizing in the proceedings of SIGGRAPH ‘07: ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 papers, ACM Press, 2007, 10. It’s based on Java and released under GPL. It accepts JPG and PNG images as input and re-targets the image. This means it cuts out the not interesting parts of an image automatically. The code is modular, so you can integrate the functionality into your programs. </p>

<p>Following images might clarify the idea. The left hand side image is the re-targeted one. Note that parts of the water below the skyline appear scaled and the sky is cropped. All this is done without manual input. </p>

 summary : <p>Java是由Sun Microsystems公司于1995年5月推出的Java程序设计语言（以下简称Java语言）和Java平台的总称。用Java实现的HotJava浏览器（支持Java applet）显示了Java的魅力：跨平台、动感的Web、Internet计算。从此，Java被广泛接受并推动了Web的迅速发展，常用的浏览器现在均支持Java applet。另一方面，Java技术也不断更新。 　　Java平台由Java虚拟机（Java Virtual Machine）和Java 应用编程接口（Application Programming Interface、简称API）构成。Java 应用编程接口为Java应用提供了一个独立于操作系统的标准接口，可分为基本部分和扩展部分。在硬件或操作系统平台上安装一个Java平台之后，Java应用程序就可运行。现在Java平台已经嵌入了几乎所有的操作系统。这样Java程序可以只编译一次，就可以在各种系统中运行。Java应用编程接口已经从1.1.x版发展到1.2版。目前常用的Java平台基于Java1.2。 　　Java语言是一个支持网络计算的面向对象程序设计语言。Java语言吸收了Smalltalk语言和C++语言的优点，并增加了其它特性，如支持并发程序设计、网络通信、和多媒体数据控制等。主要特性如下： </p>

<p>　　1)  Java语言是简单的。 </p>

<p>　　2)  Java语言是一个面向对象的。 </p>

<p>　　3)  Java语言是分布式的。 </p>

<p>　　4)  Java语言是健壮的。 </p>

<p>　　5)  Java语言是安全的。 </p>

<p>　　6)  Java语言是体系结构中立的。 </p>

<p>　　7)  Java语言是可移植的。 </p>

<p>　　8)  Java语言是解释型的。 </p>

<p>　　9)  Java是高性能的。 </p>

<p>　　10) Java语言是多线程的。 </p>

<p>　　11) Java语言是动态的。 </p>

<p>　　Java语言的优良特性使得Java应用具有无比的健壮性和可靠性，这也减少了应用系统的维护费用。Java对对象技术的全面支持和Java平台内嵌的API能缩短应用系统的开发时间并降低成本。Java的编译一次，到处可运行的特性使得它能够提供一个随处可用的开放结构和在多平台之间传递信息的低成本方式。特别是Java企业应用编程接口（Java Enterprise APIs）为企业计算及电子商务应用系统提供了有关技术和丰富的类库。 </p>

 title : The javarng Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>com.modp.randomThis package contain some unusual generators based on normal numbers and cellular automata as well as some old classics. These are designed to be used for research, and not as a replacement to the stock Random (which is fine for what it is). All of these should not be used for cryptography (SecureRandom is fine as is). </p>

<p>The Generators</p>

<p>LinearSunJDK  	The same algorithm as in com.util.Random but without synchronization   BlumBlumShub		a &#39;cryptographically-secure&#39; generator in which predicting the next bit is computationally equivalent to integer factorization.   Rule30, 192 Cells  Rule 30 celluar automaton using 192 cells   Mersenne Twister 	a high speed and high quality generator with period 219937-1   Mersenne Twiser 64 	Similar to the original but implemented using 64-bit registers.   Bailey-Crandall   	this is unusual in that it uses high-percision floating point computations to generate random bits.  </p>

<p>Detailed notes and references in are in the source.   javadoc output is here </p>

<p>With the exception of BlumBlumShub, all come with unit tests to insure that the algorithm is implemented correctly. </p>

<p>TODO: </p>

<p>Unit test for BlumBlumShub Micali-Schnorr IEEE P1363 SHA-1 Introducing RandomGeneratorOk, so a Random Number Generator, should generate bits, and bits only. It&#39;s an interface. It has one method. </p>

<p>public interface RandomGenerator {
<br/>   public int next(int numBits);
<br/>} 
<br/>That&#39;s it. How the generator is constructed, seeded or re-seeded is up to the generator. This greatly simplifies class construction since you don&#39;t worry about calling super() or worrying about synchronization.  </p>

<p>Java and Random Number GenerationAnd so, why Java? A few positive reasons first </p>

<p>Self-contained. Core java contains everything needed -- no external libraries needed. In particular: Arbitrary precision integer arithmetic SHA-1 hash algorithm known integer sizes and layout. An int is 32 bits (32 signed bits, but we can managed that). No endian issues to deal with. Reasonable performance. If you don&#39;t add gobs and gobs of abstraction (which unfortunately seems to be the norm in java), it performs quite well. Easy Mathematica integration On the other hand, I don&#39;t use java that much any more (whoops).  At some point I may write a C/C++ version and add it to Boost or the GNU Scientific Library.  </p>

<p>Problems with java.util.RandomThat said, the stock java.util.Random and it&#39;s twin java.security.SecureRandom have some problems. </p>

<p>Munges bit generation with bit consumers. Meaning, random bit generation is very different than algorithms to make random distributions. Random&#39;s constructor calls setSeed. This is a problem since if you subclass Random, setSeed will be called before your runs. This limits static initialization and makes the code harder to understand. Forced to use a long value for a seed even if it makes no sense for a particular generator Random&#39;s private or protected variables are of no use to the subclass since they are algorithm-specific. Harder to benchmark since class hierarchy causes the JIT to not make some optimizations. Synchronized. Ugh. Random is a leftover from JDK1.0 days when everything was synchronized for you. In later editions they fixed this for the container classes (note Vector and ArrayList), but not Random. This might make sense for SecureRandom since you don&#39;t want two threads potentionally corrupting the internal state, but for regular random it&#39;s a waste. To properly implement SecureRandom, you need to make a &#39;provider&#39; and all sorts of other crap that is secondary SecureRandom is closed source</p>
