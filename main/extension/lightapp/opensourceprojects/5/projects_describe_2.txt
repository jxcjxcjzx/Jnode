<p>SJSB is ok for simple scenarios, its not aiming to be a full generalized Joomla! / SMF bridge but a very simple one (see the name). So if you are looking for advanced integration features, probably you should look somewhere else :)
<br/>Main features</p>

<p>    * wrapped forum, SMF urls are rewrited to point to Joomla!.
<br/>    * SMF to Joomla! users sync. (not mandatory, you can just use the bridge as a wrapper)
<br/>    * Multiple views! enjoy the MVC system to add menu items linking to your SMF main pages (ie login, register, members, search and so on)
<br/>    * SSI module wrapper! enjoy almost 28 SSI functions wrapped for you inside a module, you can have as many as you want! from board news to top posters and so on. Thanks to the wonderful work from SMF guys they are easy to customize to better fit you</p>

<p>Once the repository root directory is deduced, it is cached (per buffer) for future reference in subsequent calls to repository-root.                                                                                      </p>
