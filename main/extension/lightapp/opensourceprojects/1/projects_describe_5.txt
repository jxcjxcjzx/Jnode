 summary : <p>HITEC is a software package for very high accuracy automatic text categorization . The engine of HITEC is the implementation of UFEX (Universal Feature EXtractor) for textual documents. UFEX is a very sophisticated learning method that ensures the outstanding categorizing performance of HITEC, hence HITEC outperforms its competitors in case of all investigated document collections. (For further details, read the white paper).</p>

<p>HITEC applies supervised learning method, that is it learns based on training data (learning phase), and is able to classify new documents to known categories (operational phase). Obviously, the performace of categorization strongly depends on the quality of training data. For efficient training HITEC requires - fixed category system (usually ordered in hierarchy); during the operational phase the new, unknown documents will be classified into that system; - some relevant training documents for each category of the category system.</p>

<p>During the operation, HITEC returns an ordered list of most relevant categories for unknown documents based on confidence values. The greater is this value HITEC deems the more relevant the corresponding category to the document. The returned list if documents can be further processed depending on the nature of classification problem. If perfect accuracy is required for the classification, an expert can accept, revise, or reject categories proposed by HITEC. If the accuracy of around 90\% having been experienced at tests is sufficient, then proposed categories can be accepted based upon their confidence value.</p>

<p>HITEC is programmed very efficiently, therefore its high performace comes with fast operation even on very large document collections. Once the training of HITEC has been done for a document collection, the operation phase is performed in real-time (see also test pages). It is able to process hunderds of gigabytes in reasonable time (training phase) and work with thousands of categories on an average PC.</p>

 title : The liboktiva-swing-iterator-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JComboBox is a index-based component. This means that for every paint, it requests the model several getElementAt(x). When the model is small there is no problem, but when the model is bigger you start having a memory issue.</p>

<p>The first remedy is to store your ComboBoxModel on disk, but then you start seeing it&#39;s difficult to have a index-based database which is fast enough to this type of access.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Berkeley DB provides a really fast btree database, which solves the problem nicely. But, as a btree it looses a lot of performance to be able to do index-based lookups.</p>

<p>This project provides two new components: JIteratorList and JIteratorComboBox, their model is Iterator-based instead of index-based, which makes it perfect to use with bdb.</p>

 summary : <p>Dependency Analyzer is a utility for analyzing visualizing Maven2 dependency graphs.
<br/>Our experience with large scale maven projects, lead us to understand that it is almost impossible to understand maven dependency resolution by just looking at the POM files or at mavens debug output.
<br/>The purpose of the Dependency Analyzer is to aid maven users with dependency resolution related tasks such as:</p>

<p>    * Finding and resolving duplicated dependencies
<br/>    * Understanding the origin of each dependency in the project
<br/>    * Dealing with missing dependencies </p>

<p>Visualization of the dependency graph alongside features such as scope and group filtering, grouping similar artifacts and more, contributes to better understanding of dependency resolution in a maven project.</p>

 title : The JikesRVM Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under an OSI approved license. Jikes RVM runs on many platforms and advances the state-of-the-art of virtual machine technologies for dynamic compilation, adaptive optimization, garbage collection, thread scheduling, and synchronization. A distinguishing characteristic of Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Java™ programming language and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.</p>
 title : The IcePick Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The aim of the IcePick project is to allow the language tools (javac, javadoc, javah, javap, apt) from the OpenJDK project to be built separately using any 1.5 compliant Java compiler. This is primarily motivated by a desire to allow these tools to be used with virtual machines that make use of the GNU Classpath library rather than simply as part of the larger IcedTea or OpenJDK distribution with the HotSpot or CACAO virtual machines.  Unlike IcedTea, IcePick&#39;s only dependency is a 1.5 capable compiler which can be provided by ecj, a gcj which uses ecj or an existing copy of javac. Because the OpenJDK class libraries and HotSpot are not being built, their requisite dependencies (see BuildRequirements are no longer needed. As a result, IcePick is buildable on a wider range of systems including those not yet supported by IcedTea. This includes those architectures other than x86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 (the latter two having experimental support on IcedTea thanks to Gary Benson) and systems which can&#39;t meet the arduous build requirements of IcedTea/OpenJDK. It also provides a solution for users who want the OpenJDK toolset but don&#39;t want to build the entire distribution.</p>
 title : The BrandWeg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The BrandWeg project is a fusion point for two Free Software projects:
<br/>GNU Classpath (http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath) and OpenJDK
<br/>(http://openjdk.java.net).  It mirrors the existing IcedTea
<br/>project (http://icedtea.classpath.org) in providing a hybrid of the
<br/>two.  However, whereas IcedTea approaches this from the perspective
<br/>of building and patching OpenJDK, we instead take GNU Classpath as the
<br/>baseline and bring in elements of the OpenJDK to fill the remaining
<br/>holes.</p>

<p>This project is still very experimental, and is being conducted outside
<br/>the repositories of either GNU Classpath or OpenJDK to retain the
<br/>stability of these code bases and also avoid any unnecessary legal
<br/>issues at this point.  The BrandWeg project does not host source
<br/>code from either project.  It consists simply of build scripts and
<br/>patches which allow a hybrid of the two to be built.</p>

 title : The c2hs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>C-&gt;Haskell is an interface generator that simplifies the development of Haskell bindings to C libraries. The tool processes existing C header files that determine data layout and function signatures on the C side in conjunction with Haskell modules that specify Haskell-side type signatures and marshaling details. Hooks embedded in the Haskell code signal access to C structures and functions -- they are expanded by the interfacing tool in dependence on information from the corresponding C header file. Another noteworthy property is the lightweight nature of the approach. The idea for the tool was developed during the implementation of Gtk+HS, a Haskell binding for the GUI toolkit GTK+. The latter is no longer under active development, but its successor, Gtk2Hs, also uses C-&gt;Haskell.</p>

 title : The Funzy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Funzy is an implementation of a Fuzzy Logic reasoning engine in Java.</p>

<p>Fuzzy logic is derived from fuzzy set theory dealing with reasoning that is approximate rather than precisely deduced from classical predicate logic. It can be thought of as the application side of fuzzy set theory dealing with well thought out real world expert values for a complex problem. Fuzzy logic allows for set membership values to range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, and in its linguistic form, imprecise concepts like &quot;slightly&quot;, &quot;quite&quot; and &quot;very&quot;. Specifically, it allows partial membership in a set. It is related to fuzzy sets and possibility theory. It was introduced in 1965 by Lotfi Zadeh at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
