 title : The Bomjpacket Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Imagine a cellphone that only has a GPRS/WAP feature and understands WML but not XHTML. These kind of phones are typically in the $100 price range. People use them to make calls but rarely do they think of using them to browse Internet. There are mobile browsers that allow one to browse Internet using a cellphone, for example Opera Mini. But they are resource demanding, whereas the idea of this project is to use minimal resources while giving the ability to browse the Internet.</p>

<p>In short, BomjPacket is like OperaMini, but it is WML-based and it is open-source!</p>

 title : The netJack Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Netjack is a Realtime Audio Transport over a generic IP Network. It is fully integrated into JACK. 
<br/> When you transport Audio Signals over a Network, you will always have the problem, that two Computers are bound to two different Sample Clocks. The other Network Transports face the Problem of compensating for the drift between these Sample Clocks. This is very hard to do. 
<br/> NetJack works around this problem, by syncing all Clients to one Soundcard. So there will be no resampling or glitches in the whole network. As long as there is no packet loss. Packet loss can not be compensated.</p>

 title : The Nodows Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is NODOWS? It is a toolchain to build custom systems, from the outside in. To be more specific, systems like gentoo and freebsd provide an incredible amount of control and customizing when building themselves. Typically these systems are built from the inside out, meaning that a process is running in an operational environment whereby the environment is replaced piece by piece as it is rebuilt. This works very well in many situations. However, some situations involve a target system without the tools that do the actual building work, like the gcc compiler, or the make tool. In this case, another system environment needs to be used to build the target. This process introduces some interesting opportunities and challenges.</p>

 title : The Algorithm-EquivalenceSets Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This module exports one function, equivalence_sets(), which takes a list of sets and returns another list of sets whose contents are transitively grouped from the input sets.</p>

<p>Imagine the input sets to be [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5, 6 ] and [ 1, 3, 7 ]. The returned sets would be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 ] and [ 5, 6 ], because [ 1, 2 ] and [ 3, 4 ] are tied together by [ 1, 3, 7 ], but [ 5, 6 ] stands on its own. So you could say the returned sets represent a kind of transitive union. (Real mathematicians may now flame me about the misuse of terminology.)</p>

<p>Each set is an array reference. The return sets are given as an array in list context, or as a reference to that array in scalar context.</p>

 summary : <p>UIDL (User Interface Description Language) aims to create a scriptable, JavaScript based language for expressing complex user interfaces. The main features of a UIDL page are the ability to create complex user interfaces (using Swing based widgets) and to communicate asynchronously with server based objects (using the JSON-RPC protocol). While this may sound similar to AJAX, the implementation is much cleaner thanks to the ability to natively instantiate complex UI components within the browser and the ability to transparently present server based objects via their JavaScript proxies.</p>

 summary : <p>Retrospectiva is an open source, web-based, project management and bug-tracking tool. It is intended to assist the collaborative aspect of work carried out by software development teams through the use of blogs, a wiki and tickets.</p>

<p>Users open tickets to track bugs, and request enhancements. Administrators set targets for the team through milestones. A milestone is considered completed when all tickets assigned to it are closed. The wiki is used for the documentation of the project, whilst the blog logs ongoing progress. When used in conjunction, these tools provide a helpful framework for developing and maintaining source code. The generated code can be browsed directly in Retrospectiva, and changesets record updates made to the source repository.</p>
