 summary : <p>Efficient, pure binary serialisation using lazy ByteStrings. Haskell values may be encoded to and form binary formats, written to disk as binary, or sent over the network.

 title : The mersenne-random Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation of very high quality pseudorandom numbers</p>

<p>This library uses SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, a variant of Mersenne Twister that is much faster than the original. It is designed to be fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD. It can be compiled with either SSE2 and PowerPC AltiVec support, to take advantage of these instructions.</p>

<p>By default the period of the function is 2^19937-1, however, you can compile in other defaults. Note that this algorithm on its own is not cryptographically secure.</p>

<p>For more information about the algorithm and implementation, see the SFMT homepage,</p>

Those other target machines do not need to be running, or even be built, at the time you check in changes. As you turn on, build, reboot, and/or run &#39;isconf up&#39; on other machines, ISconf consults the journal and executes the same changes, in the same order, on each machine.</p>
 title : The radmind Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A suite of Unix command-line tools and a server designed to remotely administer the file systems of multiple Unix machines. For Mac OS X, there&#39;s also a graphical interface.</p>

 title : The arrows Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Arrows are a new abstract view of computation, defined by John Hughes [Hug00]. They serve much the
<br/>same purpose as monads -- providing a common structure for libraries -- but are more general. In
<br/>particular they allow notions of computation that may be partially static (independent of the input)
<br/>or may take multiple inputs. If your application works fine with monads, you might as well stick
<br/>with them. But if you&#39;re using a structure that&#39;s very like a monad, but isn&#39;t one, maybe it&#39;s an
<br/>arrow.</p>

 title : The yampa Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library permits performing computations on the type-level. Type-level functions are implemented
<br/>using functional dependencies of multi parameter type classes. To date, Booleans and Numerals
<br/>(Naturals and Positives) are supported. With regard to Numerals, there is support for common
<br/>arithmetic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division, exponientation, logarithm,
<br/>maximum, comparison, GCD) over natural numbers (using a decimal representation to make compile-time
<br/>errors friendlier). Although making use of type-level computations might seem devious and obfuscated
<br/>at first sight, it is indeed useful in practice to implement lightweight dependent types such us
<br/>number-parameterized types (e.g. an array type parameterized by the array&#39;s size or a modular group
<br/>type Zn parameterized by the modulus).</p>

 summary : <p>DrIFT is a type sensitive preprocessor for Haskell. It extracts type

<br/>code, and it is intended that the user can add new rules as required. DrIFT
<br/>automates instance derivation for classes that aren&#39;t supported by the
<br/>standard compilers. In addition, instances can be produced in seperate modules
<br/>to that containing the type declaration. This allows instances to be derived
<br/>for a type after the original module has been compiled. As a bonus, simple
<br/>utility functions can also be produced from a type.</p>

 summary : <p>Inferno® is a distributed operating system, originally developed at Bell Labs, but now developed and maintained by Vita Nuova® as Free Software. Applications written in Inferno&#39;s concurrent programming language, Limbo, are compiled to its portable virtual machine code (Dis), to run anywhere on a network in the portable environment that Inferno provides. Unusually, that environment looks and acts like a complete operating system.</p>

<p>The use of a high-level language and virtual machine is sensible but mundane. The interesting thing is the system&#39;s representation of services and resources. They are represented in a file-like name hiearchy. Programs access them using only the file operations open, read/write, and close. The &#39;files&#39; may of course represent stored data, but may also be devices, network and protocol interfaces, dynamic data sources, and services. The approach unifies and provides basic naming, structuring, and access control mechanisms for all system resources. A single file-service protocol (called Styx or 9P2000) makes all those resources available for import or export throughout the network in a uniform way, independent of location. An application simply attaches the resources it needs to its own per-process name hierarchy (&#39;name space&#39;).</p>

<p>The system can be used to build portable client and server applications. It makes it straightforward to build lean applications that share all manner of resources over a network, without the cruft of much of the &#39;Grid&#39; software one sees.</p>

<p>Inferno can run &#39;native&#39; on various ARM, PowerPC, SPARC and x86 platforms but also &#39;hosted&#39;, under an existing operating system (including FreeBSD, Irix, Linux, MacOS X, Plan 9, and Solaris), again on various processor types.</p>
