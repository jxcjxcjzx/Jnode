 title : The ftnchek Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>tnchek is a static analyzer for Fortran 77 programs. It is designed to detect certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not. ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors. Its purpose is to assist the user in finding semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not declared may not have the intended type. ftnchek is intended to assist users in the debugging of their Fortran program. It is not intended to catch all syntax errors. This is the function of the compiler. Prior to using ftnchek, the user should verify that the program compiles correctly.</p>

JMX defines three types of MBeans, of which Model MBeans are the most flexible. Model MBeans provide a way to define MBeans for many different components, without having to write a specific MBean implementation class for each one.</p>

 title : The Mini vMac Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mini vMac emulates a Macintosh Plus, one of the earliest of Macintosh computers, sold between 1986 and 1990. It can run old Macintosh software that otherwise couldn’t be used on recent computers, and so helps to preserve history, from the era when the modern user interface for computers was being defined.</p>

<p>Mini vMac is a spin off of the program vMac. It was originally intended to be of limited interest, a simpler version to serve as a programmers introduction to vMac. But vMac hasn’t been updated in some years, and doesn’t have a number of fixes included in Mini vMac, so Mini vMac may now be more generally useful.</p>

 title : The Orson Chart Beans Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Most Java developers realise that it is inefficient to instantiate a separate JVM for each Java application running on a user&#39;s computer. This involves a significant extra start-up time and is wasteful of memory. Unfortunately, due to the need to segregate the effects of one application from another there hasn&#39;t been any choice.</p>

<p>On the server side however, much progress has been made in the area of Java Application Servers which are able to run multiple web applications within the same JVM.</p>

<p>The idea behind this project is simple: take the compartmentalisation technology which has been developed for servlets and reapply it to the desktop space.</p>

 title : The DBReplicator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DBReplicator is a powerful open-source Java application for network-based multi-master heterogeneous database replication or filtered synchronization.</p>

<p>The significant features and highlights of DBReplicator are enumerated below</p>

<p>    *</p>

<p>      Heterogeneous Replication - i.e., synchronizing the same database between multiple RDBMS&#39;s.
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Bi-Directional data synchronization - between any of the supported database backends, with subscriber-initiated synchronization
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Platform Independant - 100% java client and server components
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Application Independance - software need have no special knowledge of the replication, nor access its datasource any differently. This is great for applications to which you don&#39;t have source code access or rights to request changes
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Automatic Confilct Detection and Resolution - requires minimal involvement by database administrators. Basic conflict resolution is implemented as publisher wins/subscriber wins. Future versions will have more complex rule-based conflict resolution algorithms.
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Scheduling Facility - built into dbreplicator, the schedule can be specified by minutes, hours, etc., and runs the desired operation at the specified interval ad infinitum unless it encounters an error.
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Verbose Debugging - implemented using apache log4j, this can be quite flexible in terms of output methods and verbosity.
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Special Character Handling - DBReplicator handles characters with nonprinting ascii values by encoding the entire field in escaped unicode when creating sync xml files, and un-encoding at the opposite end. At present, those fields containing special characters must be specified in EncodeConfig.ini, but automatic handling is planned.
<br/>    *</p>

<p>      Table Creation - if tables don&#39;t exist in subscriber databases, DBReplicator can automatically create them for you to match those in the publisher database.</p>

 summary : <p>The Unarchiver is a much more capable replacement for &quot;BOMArchiveHelper.app&quot;, the built-in archive unpacker program in Mac OS X. The Unarchiver is designed to handle many more formats than BOMArchiveHelper, and to better fit in with the design of the Finder. It can also handle filenames in foreign character sets, created with non-English versions of other operating systems. I personally find it useful for opening Japanese archives, but it should handle many other languages just as well.</p>

 title : The crary Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of crary is to do one thing and one thing well: implement an HTTP server. It isn&#39;t constrained to rails--it doesn&#39;t even need roads. Its small enough to fit in your pocket and go with you wherever your journey takes you.</p>

<p>The intention is that its small enough and flexible enough to be used for most any HTTP server need. While it isn&#39;t a stand-alone system, nor does it have its own web-framework, these things can easily be built on top of crary. Crary should be easily embedded into the release of a larger application to provide a web interface or to create a web service interface.</p>

<p>The name crary is in honor of the inventor of the modern brick making machine, John Williamson Crary Sr. US Patents Nos. 21,186 and 67,728. Before Crary&#39;s invention bricks were formed by hand and of inconsistent dimensions/quality.</p>
