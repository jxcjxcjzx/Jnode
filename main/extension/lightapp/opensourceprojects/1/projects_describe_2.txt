 title : The liboping Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>liboping is a C library to generate ICMP echo requests, better known as &quot;ping packets&quot;. It is intended for use in network monitoring applications or applications that would otherwise need to fork ping(1) frequently. Included is a sample application, called oping, which demostrates the library&#39;s abilities. It is like ping, ping6, and fping rolled into one.</p>

<p>liboping was inspired by ping,  libping and fping: It differs from these existing solutions in that it can `ping&#39; multiple hosts in parallel using IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object oriented interface, simplicity and extensibility.</p>

It uses ASDF and has been tested on SBCL but should work for other implementations with extra code due to its use of usocket for portable sockets access.</p>

 title : The dtach Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen, allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs that know how to redraw themselves. </p>

<p>dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.</p>

Or that they generated unwanted false positive scores?</p>

<p>SpamProbe operates on a different basis entirely. Instead of using pattern matching and a set of human generated rules SpamProbe relies on a Bayesian analysis of the frequency of words used in spam and non-spam emails received by an individual person. The process is completely automatic and tailors itself to the kinds of emails that each person receives.</p>

It is GPL&#39;ed Free Software (and Open Source), built around the idea of extendibility. Its xml-driven reporting engine can theoretically parse any kind of log, given that a service driver is written to convert the raw log into a Lire DLF (Distilled Log Format) file. This means that Lire is also a long-term solution: as new network services come into vogue, Lire will be there to parse and distill their activity for you.</p>

 title : The scribble Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Scribble�s essentially designed to be a friendly way to create cool graphics. It�s scriptable in what I hope is a friendly manner, and can do some reasonably snazzy things. Eventually, I hope it will be able to do many very snazzy things.</p>

<p>Scribble uses the cairo graphics library for rendering the graphcs, and the GTK+ widget toolkit for the graphical user interface. The rendering bit is separated from the GUI, so it�s entirely possible to use it without needing users to install GTK. If this makes it into Hackety, that�s how I imagine it being used.</p>

 title : The EventDispatcher Open Source Project on Open Hub
