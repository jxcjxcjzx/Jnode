<p>As you can see, two months have already passed since I last released version 0.9.9 why is that? Well I&#39;ve stopped playing the game due to boredom and as of right now I&#39;ve also lost my motivation on continuing this project. It&#39;s pretty hard to keep up with the updates on the game that has something to do with AI, like the new mercenary pets (i.e Mimic, Alice, etc.) specially if you&#39;re not hardcore on playing this shits. </p>

 summary : <p>News2008-12-01: The 0.12.0 release of the atomojo server is available. See the Roadmap for more information. 2008-07-21: The 0.11.1 release of the atomojo server is available.  This is a bug fix release. 2008-07-21: The 0.11.0 release of the atomojo server is available.  This release now supports SPARQL queries.  See the Roadmap for more information. 2008-06-13: The 0.10.0 release of the atomojo server is available.  This release separates the storage from the eXist database.  The default is now file-based and you must download an additional set of jars to get eXist XMLDB support. See the Roadmap for more information. 2008-05-21: The 0.6.0 release of the auth service is available.  This release contains an enhancement to create a regular user which can authenticate across realms. 2008-05-20: The 0.10.0 release of the atomic client is available. OverviewThis project contains both an Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) server and client.  While both are intended to be used together, as they implement a standard protocol, they can be used with other APP-enable applications. </p>

<p>Atomojo Firefox ExtensionThe client is a Firefox plugin that contains an XPCOM component for interacting with the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP). </p>

<p>You can install it from the addon page or download from this site.  If you download it from this site, just drag the XPI file onto an open firefox window. </p>

<p>DocumentsUsing Atomic with Blogspot. Atomojo ServerThe Atomojo server provides a uniform way to store multiple feeds and manipulate them with the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP).  Feeds are organized hierarchically and indexed by their categorization.  It provides both metadata feeds for getting context information about feeds as well as pulling a feed for each categorization stored in the database. </p>

<p>The server runs on top of a restlet.org engine and uses a rest-style URI architecture for its feeds.  Feed are organized hierarchically just like a file system using a plug-in based storage system that current supports files and an XML database called eXist. </p>

<p>In addition to querie facilities provided by the storage (e.g. XQuery for eXist), there is a metadata index that is stored in an embedded Derby database.  This index stores information about what feeds contain what entries as well as information about categorization. </p>

<p>Once the server is started, you can get the service introspection document by a GET on the server root.  All feeds are available under the /R/ URI hierarchy, terms are available under /T/, and metadata is available under /M/. </p>

<p>DocumentsA development Roadmap for future directions. The Administration Guide for the server. The Users Guide for the server. The APP Extensions implemented by the server. Using XQuery with the server. The Atomojo Term Ontology describes the entry categorization used by the server. A specification of the pull synchronization process. A specification of the push synchronization process. Getting StartedJust download the jar-file installer and following the instructions in the Administration Guide for installing and running the server.  Once you&#39;ve done that, you can immediately start working with the server. </p>

<p>When the server first starts for the first time, it creates the database.  A administrator user is created with the username and password of &#39;admin&#39;. </p>

<p>The database is initially empty.  You need to at least create the root feed. Given the server bound to the local host, you just need to post a feed to the root path: </p>

<p>POST /R/
<br/>Content-Type: application/atom+xml
<br/>...</p>

<p>Root
<br/>You can use the poster addon to do this if you wish. </p>

<p>In fact, you can create your feeds at any point in the hierarchy.  If you want to start with a feed at /x/y/z, you&#39;d just post your starter feed document to that path. </p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve got the server running, you can get the introspection document from the root of the server (e.g. https://localhost:8080).  There is a single workspace that will be empty until you create at least one collection. </p>

<p>Auth ServiceThe auth service provides an implementation of the auth protocol.  The service itself is self contained and allows you to store multiple &quot;realms&quot; of authentication.  This service is capable of supporting multiple atomojo servers. </p>

<p>DocumentsA development roadmap for future directions. The Administration Guide for the server. The Authentication Protocol. Getting StartedJust download the jar-file installer and following the instructions in the Administration Guide for installing and running the server.  Once you&#39;ve done that, you can immediately start working with the server. </p>

<p>When the server first starts for the first time, it creates the database.  A administrator user is created with the username and password of &#39;admin&#39;.</p>

<p>05/21/2007 Ver 0.4.0 released.This version: </p>

<p>has AutumnGen, a generator for wrapper files. You needn&#39;t now write any code to use Autumn framework, you can generate wrapper files(a head file and a implementation file) from a head file with AutumnGen. bean support init-method, destroy-method and delete-method attributes. change &quot;type&quot; to &quot;bean&quot;, remove &quot;type&quot; element in configure file. </p>

<p>03/26/2007 Ver 0.3.0 released.This version: </p>

<p>needn&#39;t set property&#39;s type or constructor argument&#39;s type in configuration file. If set, it will replace the type got with wrapper. bean supports factory-method attribute and multiple factory methods, and don&#39;t support overloading. erase bean&#39;s attributes: initializable and destroyable. Bean supports init and destroy function however, it&#39;s decided by definition of bean wrapper support bean reference. unite IBasicType and ICombinedType into IAutumnType. </p>

<p>03/13/2007 Ver 0.2.0 released.This version supports creating bean using &#39;instance factory&#39; and &#39;static factory method&#39; patterns. You can find samples in test project. </p>

<p>It may be very babyish now, because I don&#39;t know Spring well and do this to imitate Spring in a hurry. I will write some docs ASAP. Now, it support: </p>

<p>Support property injection and constructor injection.Only two constructors now, one has arguments and one has no argument. The setter function name should be like setXXX where XXX is a property name. You may not obey that rule if you rewrite the file BeanWrapperMacro.h. Support following basic type: char, short, int, long, float, double, char*, string, and some docrated with unsigned. Support class injection. (A class is named as a bean in Autumn like in Spring.)  Support customized type using interface IBasicType. Support pointer to above types. Support singleton. Support initialization and destroyation functions. Support property setter overloading. Supoort dependence(it may be not like Spring). Support multiple dynamic libraries and local library(bean is in main process). Support configuration of log file path and level.</p>

 summary : <p>BamaLabA system for introducing students to basic circuits and electrical propertiesOverview and PhilosophyElectronic devices have become ubiquitous in modern society. No matter how seemingly complex, however, electronic devices rely on the electrical properties of their component materials. This necessarily implies that it is becoming increasingly crucial that students of science and engineering have a detailed and hands-on understanding of the basic principles of electric circuits and the electronic properties of materials.  </p>

<p>However, a hands-on approach to teaching these concepts at the introductory undergraduate level is often lacking. To this end, I have been developing a simple and inexpensive hands-on computerized tutorial aimed at introducing beginning undergraduate students to basic circuits and electrical properties of materials. The tutorial consists of less than $200 in hardware per seat, and makes use of freely available (GPL) software. Keeping hardware cost at a minimum and freely distributing software will allow, we hope, rapid uptake of the tutorial by others.  </p>

<p>Currently, the prototype hardware and software is complete, and has been classroom tested during three semesters since Spring 2007. See http://ph102.blogspot.com for some example lab procedures, and &quot;overview.pdf&quot; in the downloads section (http://bamalab.googlecode.com/files/overview.pdf) for an overview of the system. An open-content course textbook is in the works that should go along nicely with the system, you can find it at http://faculty.mint.ua.edu/~pleclair/ph102/Notes/ph102_notes.pdf [~30Mb PDF]. You can download a reasonably-current binary with installer here: http://bama.ua.edu/~pleclair/Labjack/ </p>

<p>Tutorial motivationStudents within many disciplines are exposed to the basic concepts of electronic devices and electrical properties of materials. Rarely, however, are these concepts presented in a hands-on manner. Not only is this a major gap in their educational experience, it is a serious impediment in many cases to their introduction to laboratory research. For example, many Physics students who have mastered advanced electromagnetic theory have never wired a real circuit. Fewer still have ever learned how to perform basic electrical property measurements. Almost none have performed modern, computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis. Most physics courses currently lack a computerized hands-on approach to electronics and electronic properties. One primary reason for this has been cost – data acquisition modules comparable to what we have developed can costs thousands of dollars per seat.  </p>

<p>Project status and detailsThe current project, in development, can accomplish this at about $200/seat. What this project includes: GPL&#39;d software to run the data acquisition hardware, laboratory procedures, complete hardware schematics and assembly instructions. Everything you need to build the hardware and install the software (less about $200) will be detailed here. Sourcing of current and voltage (including sweeps), measuring of current and voltage, time-dependent behavior of RC circuits, and a simple oscilloscope are currently supported in software. I(V), V(I), and V(time) curves can be measured and saved to simple ascii files for analysis. The hardware is designed to be inexpensive, transparent, and easily assembled.

 title : The cdocs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Development of documents that refine and reflect group opinion poses several challenging tasks that an appropriate web-based system could greatly facilitate. The ConsensusWiki? system is designed to be such a system, providing an accessible, scalable, and efficient method for groups to develop documents. It uses a variety of authoring and voting mechanisms, combined in a design informed by experience with several off-line collaboration processes.  
<br/>While the ConsensusWiki? system makes extensive use of the consensus-building aspect of wiki-style openness and convergent discussion, it adds structure to this process in several ways. Authorship of each proposed alternative is maintained, with changes in proposals made only by their authors (who can be individuals or groups with their own decision process). Straw-poll and alternative-selection votes are also used to guide the process. The development of consensus about the document content is encouraged and facilitated, but decisions can still be reached if consensus is not achieved.  
<br/>Each ConsensusWiki? document is developed under a decision rule that defines the authority of each class of participants and the rules for invoking voting processes if needed to winnow the list of alternatives during the development process. This rule is itself a document, of course, which could have been decided by prior use of the ConsensusWiki? mechanism (the site provides a default rule for making rules, or one could be chosen by the legal authority for the organization by which the document is being developed).  
<br/>Each ConsensusWiki? process is overseen by a document guide who makes the human-judgment procedural decisions called for in the document rule, and generally facilitates the process. The guide also has authority to correct abuses and restrict access for users who do not follow the rules. Guide decisions are subject to appeal to ratification by participant vote, so a guide must maintain the trust of most participants for the process to advance. However, the guide need not have deep knowledge about the topic – that is supplied by the participants. It may eventually be feasible to replace some guide functions (such as deciding when stage transitions are appropriate) by either automated analysis or by distributed moderation techniques.</p>

 title : The databasemigrationmodel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Species Reactionary ModelA Relational and Mathematical Model to Describe the Effects of Species Removal, Species Induction and Environmental Changes on Species and their MovementCreated by Derek Hammer, Chandler Kent and Mark JenneWe aim to create a functional, relational model of species interaction. A user will have the ability to define environmental disruptions on a preset landmass. The model will respond by predicting probable migration patterns of various species affected by the environmental event and update the state of the species throughout the landmass to reflect their movement. A web-based graphical user-interface will provide a medium for the user to visualize the changes taking place in the database as well as to control the state of the model. The species migration model provides the interested user with the ability to predict species behavior within a large and climatically diverse setting. This model has the potential of providing the underlying foundation of a highly accurate and practical means of forecasting species movement in real-time. For instance, a feature within our model allows the user to specifically pinpoint and track the movement of a single species. Using the above feature, the population and behavior of an endangered species can be extrapolated into the near future to predict how the state of the species will change in the coming years. This insight gained from such analysis can be used to alleviate the species chance for survival. The species migration model has the potential for becoming a heavily utilized tool within the scientific community, based on the value and nature of the data derived by the model. The insight into and relevant data obtained regarding movement patterns of varying species will be open to any user seeking access to such information, and could be specifically useful to scientists and researchers. This system will benefit any user seeking data on behavioral interaction among species, and could be useful among students attempting to collect such data for analysis.</p>

 summary : <p>OverviewThe Digital Media Service Desktop (DMS Desktop) is a desktop application that guides the user through the process of producing and then publishing digital audio recordings on the web (as MP3 files, as podcast and RSS) and on CD. </p>

<p>It offers the following main advantages: </p>

<p>easy to learn for anyone easy to install and integrate with exiting infrastructure customisable to meet specific needs free of charge Why not take a few minutes to have a look at the DMS Desktop demonstration? The following two church web sites show the published result: Christ Church Bromley: sermons web page   Leigh Road Baptist Church: sermons web page   Here are some screen shots explaining the DMS Desktop functionality:         
<br/>In particular it provides the following features: Audio meta data entry: It allows the user to enter data relating to the recordings which is then used for tagging the recordings and managing them. It makes sure that the user does not have to enter the same data again and again, reduces the potential for mistakes and increase consistency. Recording: It enables the user to record to the WAV files format. The recording process can be paused. Conversion to MP3: The user can convert the WAV files to MP3 files. The MP3 files can be tagged with the data the user entered.  Web publishing: It contains the functionality to upload the recoding files to a web server. It also generates a web page containing links to the recordings based on templates and uploads the web page to a web server. With one click, new recordings can be published on the web.  Podcast/RSS publishing: As part of the publishing process it can produce a podcast/RSS file and upload to a web server widening the way consumers can access the recordings. CD buring: It enables the user to burn an audio CD with the recordings. (requires Nero 6.0 or later) Remote support: It provides the option for the user to send comprehensive support information to an email address simplify  in problem diagnostics and resolution. It is also possible to update the application data remotely. Application editor: It includes an editor that allows the user to make certain customisations such as add/editing and deleting new tasks. </p>

<p>System requirementsTo run the DMS Desktop, you need at least: </p>

<p>Java Runtime Environment 6.0 or higher (is included in one of the distributions) Windows XP or Windows Vista operating system (It may also run on other Java-supported operating systems without the CD burning capabilities although this has not been tested.) 512 MB RAM 200 MB hard disk space Screen resolution of 1024x768 or more </p>

<p>Getting startedGetting started is easy: </p>

<p>Just download one of the DMS Desktop distributions (see below). Click here if you are not sure which one you need. Unzip all files to your root directory (e.g. C:\). Run Desktop.bat (e.g. C:\Onceforall\DMS Desktop\Desktop.bat). If you get a warning from your security software, allow Java to access the internet/network. You should now see something similar to the screenshot above. Please note that you will need to purchase a copy of Nero if you want to use the CD burning capabilities.   </p>

<p>DownloadsThe DMS Desktop is available in two versions: </p>

 title : The drumroller Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project seeks to provide drivers for the Ion Drum Rocker peripheral, a prosumer-grade electronic drum kit designed to work with the Rock Band series of games.  The focus will be on the Xbox 360 version of the device because, well, it&#39;s the only one out right now. </p>

<p>Unlike previous Xbox 360 controller driver projects, this one will be targeted only at the Drum Rocker and compatible peripherals, and will provide MIDI events rather than the typical HID events.  Because the Drum Rocker abuses the HID protocol in a somewhat unique way, it also seems likely that the driver will sit entirely in userspace rather than attempt to use the existing input infrastructure in each OS.  This has the added advantage of making the driver more portable. </p>

<p>The Guitar Hero: World Tour drums are also apparently velocity-sensitive, although it would be surprising if they used the same protocol perversions that the Drum Rocker does.  If the author can get his hands on a set, GH:WT support will be added.</p>

<p>IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE LATEST NEWS ON EVIDENCE for DEVELOPMENT&#39;S OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT YOU SHOULD LOOK HERE: http://code.google.com/p/open-ihm/ </p>

<p>IntroductionWiki for Evidence For Development Individual Household Model software redevelopment </p>

<p>EFD Home Page </p>

<p>DetailsJohn Seaman and Celia Petty spent years working out how to ¡measure¢ poverty in rural communities. First at a high level at the district/province and national level with a method called the Household Economy Approach and more recently at a local level with a new technique called the Individual Household Model (IHM) (think a village in Malawi, or maybe a group of villages in the same district). </p>

<p>HEA has been used widely to predict the effect of crop failures or loss of markets and has been very effective. Recently there was a major crop failure in Malawi, but we didn¢t read about it in the papers or see it on TV because there was no famine, no starving babies looking heart wrenching on the 6 o¢clock news. Because the government of Malawi knew it was coming and acted quickly and cheaply to avert the disaster. Result! </p>

<p>But HEA cannot tell you what will happen if you give free schooling to all the orphans in a region badly affected by AIDS. Would it be better for the local economy if you gave their families food aid? Or cash grants? IHM can answer questions like this, if you gather some data up front, and it can tell you what actually happened a year later so you can be sure the program is running properly and the money isn&#39;t all ending up in someone¢s back pocket. This kind of measurement is becoming very, very important when we think about how much money is being thrown at projects like this - our money in many cases, and how little effect they sometimes have. </p>

<p>John and Celia are training people to use IHM and encouraging agencies to use it, by leading project after project in Africa. But it&#39;s a hard slog because the only implementation of the software to manage the data and mathematical models in IHM was built by John himself in Access and VB. John¢s a doctor not a programmer and maintenance and upgrade eats into his time on each project. The real breakthrough will happen when it&#39;s not just John and Celia on a handful of projects for a few enlightened agencies. It will be when there are hundreds of IHM practitioners out there with many, most or all the major agencies and when it¢s taught in the Development Economics departments of Universities. That¢s achievable, but not as long as each project is dependent on only two people and a hand-rolled customization project on the software. </p>

<p>This project aims to produce a cool, simple to use (and learn), user-customizable implementation of IHM. That way John and Celia can concentrate on spreading the word and training up other IHM practitioners so they can achieve their aim of raising the effectiveness of potentially $billions of aid projects. </p>

<p>If you want to make a difference and have PHP and/or database skills then please get in touch. Currently the work involves documenting the Access data model; analysis of the datamodel; conversion to MySQL; building data maintenance screens in PHP and more documentation.

<br/>Net SenderThe easiest way for Windows hosts within a LAN to chat when the damn Internet is down and no messenger works. Basically a GUI that wraps net send functionality. 
<br/>Simple Net / Simple ChatAn infrastructure to create server/client desktop applications. This kind of app needs various threads to handle message exchange over network in order to keep the GUI fresh (not blocked), since network operations are time consuming and error prone. Simple Net hides the complexity of sockets and threads and notifies clients of network events, like message arrivals and client (dis)connections. Simple Net doesn&#39;t impose any protocol to the messages exchanged between server and clients. Simple Chat is a chat application that uses Simple Net infrastructure. It&#39;s intended to test Simple Net functionality. Resource downloaderSuppose you have a URL &quot;A&quot;, the page pointed by the URL &quot;A&quot; have many other URLs &quot;B&quot; that match a pattern.

 title : The gnap-dev Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Gentoo Network Appliance (GNAP)What is GNAP ?The acronym GNAP stands for Gentoo Network APpliance. It&#39;s an easy way to build Gentoo-based network appliance systems, ready for use in old PCs or embedded devices without the need for a full installation. </p>

<p>Using GNAP, you can build in a few minutes target systems geared toward network services like routing, firewalling, traffic profiling, VPN and network monitoring, that will run directly from a LiveCD or a disk device (including CompactFlash cards or DiskOnModules). </p>

<p>Specific configuration files are added to the LiveCD or disk to customize its behaviour. Those systems can run stateless, making them easy to restart, and impossible to permanently compromise. They can also save their modified configuration so that they don&#39;t need to be rebuilt all the time. </p>

<p>But why GNAP ?I had a bunch of old PCs with fragile components, and wanted to use them as internal routers and firewalls. I wanted to be able to easily switch PCs in case of failure. Using removable media with a burned-on configuration is the most flexible way I found. When it fails, just put the media on another machine. I started by using LEAF Bering-uClibc floppy-based firewalls but was quickly undermined by problems: media fragility, difficulty to automate creation of floppies and lack of easy extensibility. I switched to LEAF Bering-uClibc CDROM-based configurations, with a web-based automated ISO generation. This solved most of the problems but the extensibility problems remain, and maintaining the web-app was becoming a nightmare. </p>

<p>I finally chose to leverage Gentoo Catalyst power to build custom LiveCDs, solving both the extensibility problem and the non-standard solution maintenance. The idea was to have a generic LiveCD core that I could build once and use everywhere, and burn on the CD a specific configuration overlay to customize the appliance role. This simplifies CD generation as you don&#39;t have to go through the whole Catalyst process to customize a specific LiveCD. </p>

<p>Fast to build, easy to maintain up to dateTo create a GNAP system, use the provided GNAP Core and create configuration overlays detailing your specific needs. Using the gnap_overlay script, in a few seconds your overlays are combined to the GNAP Core to produce a new LiveCD ISO file. Burn this file to a CD, put it inside an old box (no hard disk or mouse needed), and boot. Alternatively, use the same script to initialize a disk device with a complete bootable filesystem, put the disk in its target environment, and boot. </p>

<p>To completely update a GNAP configuration, just modify your saved overlay and combine it to the latest GNAP Core to produce an updated GNAP system. Reboot the appliance with the new system. You&#39;re done.</p>

 title : The google-web-toolkit-doc-1-4 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the official documentation for Google Web Toolkit Version 1.4. Note that version 1.4 is no longer the current one. You may wish to take a look at the main GWT page if you&#39;re not sure how to proceed. </p>

<p>Developer&#39;s GuideWriting web apps today is a tedious and error-prone process. Developers can spend 90% of their time working around browser quirks. In addition, building, reusing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases and AJAX components can be difficult and fragile. Google Web Toolkit (GWT) eases this burden by allowing developers to quickly build and maintain complex yet highly performant JavaScript front-end applications in the Java programming language. </p>

<p>The topics presented below provide comprehensive coverage of GWT from many different angles. For new comers, there are tutorials to get you started, FAQs covering many of those very early questions and a glossary to highlight important terminology. For more experienced GWT developers, the API Reference is one that you will surely want to bookmark and the Developer Guide delves very deeply into many advanced topics that will help you make the most of GWT. Also, for those who are simply trying to understand what GWT offers, this guide offers a wonderful way to get a view of the available features that goes well beyond bullet points.</p>

<p>The use of Google Web Toolkit and Apache Derby as development tools is because they are new, but popular and powerful development tools which aim to facilitate the work of the programmer, in order to concentrate in the main aspects of the application, instead of worry about low-level implementation details. Google Web Toolkit provides a Java API for web-based applications, and in the compilation phase it converts all of Java code to optimized JavaScript code. Apache Derby is a small footprint database management system which can be easily integrated with Java since it is totally written in Java and provides a easy Java API. </p>

<p>Java Persistence API (commonly known as just JPA) is used to implement persistence. Persistence refers to the ability of an object to live besides the lifetime of the process that created it. It makes use of Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) as persistence entities and requires the identification of the classes that will be stored in the database. A POJO is a term used to refer to a ordinary Java Object to emphasize the idea that ordinary objects can be used to represent persistence entities. The API uses the term Entity to define classes that will map to a relational database.</p>

It also comes with a Transformer interface that you can inject into your client code. Reflection based. Plain Java classes can be used as adapters, or you can directly implement the Adapter interface. Works well with Spring and probably other IoC containers. No dependencies.  News and blogsIntroducing JAdapter 0.1 JAdapter: Convention over Configuration JAdapter 0.2 is out PurposeOften you need to convert from one type to another. For example when your service code returns object of type A, but you really needed an object of type A+. Or when you require AB, but the API only provides A. This conversion is often performed by adapting the original type to the new type using adapters.  </p>

<p>The adaptation usually takes place directly in the client code. This means that the client has to: 1) know the type of the object and determine which adapter is most suitable for it, 2) know about all possible adapters that are suitable for the current adaptation, 3) handle possible adapter dependencies that are not known at compile time.  </p>

<p>JAdapter aims to solve these problems. Adapters are first registered in a central registry and can then be looked up as needed. This makes adapter registration a configuration activity and can be carried out in the context of DI frameworks, such as the Spring framework.</p>

 title : The jbati Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jBati ORMjBati is a JavaScript library for Object Relational Mapping (ORM).  The API and configuration is modeled on iBATIS and the targeted platform is Jaxer. </p>

<p>The jBati framework maps SQL statements you write to domain objects.  jBati is best suited for an existing DB schema, or when domain objects are backed by complex SQL querries.   </p>

<p>jBati provides a simple to use and understand framework that exposes the full power of SQL and takes care of the repetitive coding of mapping result sets and query parameters to JavaScript values. To use the jBati framework, you write custom SQL for CRUD operations, define a mapping to objects, and the library takes care of marshaling and un-marshaling JavaScript objects. </p>

<p>What&#39;s up with the name?jBati is inspired by iBATIS, which is a successful project with a much larger stature than this new project; therefore less letters and less capital letters are used in the name (it&#39;s jBati instead of jBATIS). </p>

<p>The j in jBati might stand for JavaScript, Jaxer, or maybe even iBATIS junior. </p>

<p>News200805 - Developers Guide updated to include an example.   </p>

<p>200804 - jBati V0.1.0 Released!  The initial release of jBati is available on the downloads page. </p>

 title : The laszloparty Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The platinum library is a platform abstraction library, geared primarily towards MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game development. </p>

<p>The library provides a common development target for networking, opengl, threading, sound, input and other misc game targeted components. </p>

<p>Platinum does not re-invent the wheel by reimplementing existing libraries.  Instead it wraps the existing platform libraries for each functional component, into a nice easy to use object based system. </p>

<p>Platinum is designed to allow write once and run everywhere with little or no modifications and does not require any external libraries other than the ones that would normally be expected to ship with the platform.  This makes installation of products using Platinum a snap since you don&#39;t have to manage long complex chains of dependencies.  </p>

<p>Platinum is written entirely in Cross-Platform ISO C++. </p>

<p>Platinum works out of the box on Windows, Linux and Mac OS/X,  other platforms may be added in the future, and should be relatively easy to add because of it&#39;s modular design. </p>

<p>Development of Platinum takes place as part of a larger development effort aimed at producing a highly efficient MMO Engine called DREAM (Dynamic Robust Engine for Advanced MMOs).   </p>

<p>There is an online book that goes in depth into the development of both Platinum and DREAM, and focuses on cross platform MMO game development.  The book and community can be found at http://www.dreamrpgonline.com/ </p>

<p>There is are closed source licensing options available for development of commercial (non GPL&#39;d) games.  You can find more information about it at http://www.dreamrpgonline.com/</p>

 summary : <p>UpdateI believe that I&#39;ve done enough testing now to prove to myself that this will even better than I previously thought. Though my ideas on exactly what this engine will entail have changed a bit. The change being, that it will be a client side engine with a very limited server side library. Anything related to an actual game will be posted on my main project website: http://www.nemesisstar.com. Only things related to the JavaScript Canvas Engine itself will be posted here including source code, code samples, and code-walk through&#39;s on more difficult sections to understand. </p>

<p>Sound support and IE support are secondary (in that order!) initial sound support will be added via a scriptable flash component, but since I have a distaste for flash other components will be added as well (Unity3D, Java). </p>

<p>First release will support a very simple RPG world with an Isometric view. It will be stand-alone with some limited server-side scripting (retrieve data for the game itself). After that it fully functional I will begin adding support for other thing such as the option to go from isometric to a flat 2d map, ability to turn the isometric map, and then ultimately cross-domain gaming. I&#39;m very interested to see what people do with the ability for a single game to navigate across multiple domains with only a simple script plugin. </p>

 title : The metagame Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Meta-Game aims at being a full-featured engine for computer role-playing games, possibly massively multi-player online ones. Its purpose is also to be an exercise in style and design, making it elegant using modern C++ techniques, and even exploiting features of the forthcoming C++0x standard which already has some parts implemented in some compilers. </p>

<p>It uses a client/server approach with a simple and clearly-specified protocol so that the client and the server can be independent and thus favor competing clients, eventually with different capabilities (text mode, 2D, 3D...). Development focuses for now on the server which is designed with a hybrid programming approach, combining C++ with Python, since it is to be highly scriptable for rules and items. </p>

 summary : <p>Micron System Version 3 IntroductionMicron System was originally developed by Martin Tang(the Version 1 and Version 2 which were based on a research project) during the last 2 years.  </p>

<p>By Version 3, Micron System Team gathered a small group of motivated people who are willing to do the challenge to bring the classical UNIX operating system back to the modern history by replacing its old shell environment with a new Microsoft Windows GDI+ like GUI front end.  </p>

<p>Declearing that our source codes ARE NOT BASED ON ANY third party&#39;s(including BSD and Linux) source code, the Micron System(including its source code) will be released under our Micron System Public License Agreement(BSD). </p>

<p>The Team have chosen Qemu branching from 0.9.0 as our official system emulator(board based) and will add our new architecture supports(which will be supported by Micron System). The code will be maintain in our SVN repository, and be published under its original license respecting its original authors who did the great work. </p>

<p>Micron System has no intention to be a Windows or Linux replacement(which are both PC based), but a new POSIX system for the whole computer system(supporting many processors with exactly the same HAL), future applications will include game consoles, handhelds, industrial control systems, communication systems, etc. When you learned one architecture&#39;s development method from Micron System, there will be no more pain to pay for other processors supported, at the same time, the hardware designers will have more freedom to switch to their project&#39;s best choised processors. </p>

<p>There may have commercial activity involved as we don&#39;t refuse to commercial development, but in the future if you want to public Micron System within a commercial product, you first have to gain a copy of our signed permition prior as described in our License Agreement. </p>

<p>English is used as our natural language, and we welcome any people from any country to participate in our project, who can provide us help (both technical and documentary) by providing patches, technical hardware specs, even suggestions, at the same time, we are just cool guys willing to do something like you are =P </p>

The second version is under svn/trunk/development and should not be assumed to be stable but includes the most recent updates to the code. </p>

<p>2- The MITesProjects.zip: The file includes the project files for visual studio for different platforms (currently PC and PocketPC). </p>

<p>3- The Bin.zip: The file includes some of the needed files to compile the project in visual studio and will include the binaries generated during compilation. </p>

<p>Instructions for Compiling the Code and Running with Attached MITes Sensors1- First, make sure you have the right number of MITes receivers connected to your machine.  </p>

<p>2- Download the source tree. (Go to the source tab for instructions). Use the development version, go to svn/trunk/development. </p>

<p>3- Download the most recent zip file for Visual Studio projects  Development MITes Projects. </p>

<p>4- Download the latest bin zip file Development Bin Zip File. </p>

<p>5- Uncompress both zip files in the root source code directory (i.e. where MITesSRC/ exists) so that you end up with the MITesSRC directory, the MITesProjects-v9 and the bin-v9 directories at the same level. For the development version, uncompress the zip files under develeopment/.  </p>

<p>6- Inside the unizippped MITesProjects-v9/ folder, you will find MITesProjects/ folder. Move this folder to its parent directory development/. Similarly, move the bin/ folder inside bin-v9/ to the development/ directory. You should have the following 3 folders in the development/ directory: MITesSRC/, bin/ and MITesProjects/. </p>

<p>7- To run the PC version, navigate under the source directory to MITesProjects/PC and click MITesDataCollection.sln. Alternatively, to run the Pocket PC version, navigate under the source directory to MITesProjects/PPC and click MITesDataCollection.sln. This will load the appropriate solution in Visual Studio.  </p>

<p>8- Using Visual Studio&#39;s solution explorer, set the MITesDataCollection project as the startup project. </p>

<p>9- Rebuild the solution. </p>

<p>10- Choose the &#39;start debugging&#39; option under Debug. The code should run. </p>

 title : The mobilogger Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to Mobilogger projectMobiLogger is a mobile blogging tool for the Android platform. It&#39;s main design principles are: </p>

<p>Do one thing (mobile blogging) and do it well No matter where your blog is hosted, it&#39;ll be editable with MobiLogger Simpler is better </p>

<p>Basically, you just install MobiLogger, configure your blog(s) to MobiLogger and start writing. Currently, MobiLogger is in it&#39;s first public release so don&#39;t expect it to do eveything. But it&#39;s constantly improving! </p>

<p>New page for the development and HTC HeroDue to constant delays of me getting and Android phone, I&#39;ve been putting off the development Mobilogger for a while. A few days back, I finally got my hands on the HTC Hero! So now you should expect me back in the active development mode again, and commits pouring! </p>

<p>I have to say, HTC Hero is the best smartphone I have ever used and it&#39;s so fulfilling to know that I actually can implement everything I can ever imagine on this device.  </p>

<p>Currently I&#39;m working on the code to include pictures to the blog postings. Earlier, you could only insert IMG tags to the postings, but now the plan is to have Mobilogger upload the images to your favorite image gallery service and use the URL in the automatically generated IMG tag. Currenlty I plan to support Picasa Web and Flickr.  </p>

<p>Current code changes have been mostly getting the framework around the changes in shape, but I expect to get into developing the actual beef really shortly.  </p>

<p>So life&#39;s good! </p>

<p>Testers needed for 2009 RC 1 !! (and a small rant)Yesterday I got around releasing the RC1 for this year. This contains mostly bug fixes, but is the baseline for future work. The project has been in hiatus for some time, since I STILL CAN&#39;T BUY AN ANDROID PHONE FROM FINLAND, which is hugely annoying. I&#39;ve been delaying the purchase of the Dev Phone, since we constantly get promised that &quot;It&#39;ll be still another month before LG/Samsung/Whoever releases a new GPhone&quot;. I tried the dev phone 1 and didn&#39;t like it enough to buy one. I don&#39;t want to own many different phones, I want one which I can use and develop software on. It should not be too much to ask. Right...Right? </p>

<p>Release 2008.3 releasedThis version now supports the SDK 1.0 and should now be tested on the real device. </p>

<p>Release 2008.2 feature highlights:Supported blog interfaces or services: Blogger/Blogspot Wordpress weblogs Metaweblog api (Drupal and various other CMSs) LiveJournal Basic yet capable rich text editing features Save entries locally and post when connected Easy to use NewsMon, Nov 24th 2008 </p>

<p>I just released 2008.3 which was surprisingly difficult to get out. Turned out that the SDK1.0 API changes actually messed up a lot of external library code so I needed to do quite a bit of work. Anyway. Hopefully some kind G1 owner will now test this. </p>

<p>Wed, May 12th 2008 </p>

<p>Looking for more project members! The release plan is currently lagging behind because of the lack of time I have for the project. MobiLogger codebase is relatively simple still so it&#39;s a perfect time to join the project! So if you are a capable developer/UI designer/tester who is willing to take responsibility of some of the development tasks, please join the project!   </p>

<p>Would be especially neat to find someone with a read device, but of course you can just as well work with the emulator only. </p>

 title : The modularengine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Modular Engine (Working Title)Modular engine will not be the final title of this project because it is more of a descriptor than anything.  Modular Engine is something that rather follows a title like Chester: A Modular Application Engine. </p>

<p>What is Modular Engine?Modular Engine is a project I started to ease the building of other projects.  Instead of rewriting a lot of code or using libraries that probably don&#39;t fit the aims of my project and are hard to incorporate, I started this.   </p>

<p>With Modular Engine, you can take whatever parts of the engine you need for new projects and seamlessly integrate it in.  One can also start developing a new project off the core of Modular Engine.   </p>

<p>Ultimately the core of Modular Engine is very simple.  It basically loads and runs modules from the code.  The current modules are mostly Windows/OpenGl oriented, and I hope to change that in the near future.  I would like to have, at least, a Linux port of this project by Version 2.0, hopefully that will come through a single module (after some code revising) and some porting of Windows Specific Code. </p>

<p>What is Modularity?Modularity can be defined in many different ways.  For myself and this project I go by the following definition: In computer science, modularity is the property of computer programs that measures the extent to which they have been composed out of separate parts called modules. (Wikipedia.com) In Modular Engine, each major element of the engine (i.e. graphics, sound, networking, HUD, Windows Interface, etc.) are a separate DLL that can essentially be loaded by any program to be used as they will. </p>

<p>Originally I had hoped to have this project run modules with absolutely no dependencies (i.e. Any module can be used without the importing of another.)  This is simply unfeasible, but the goal of this project is to use as few modules as possible.    </p>

<p>The reason it has developed as such at the present time is because of two things: </p>

<p>Ease of development At the current time, I am the sole programmer on this project, but hope that by version .7 or later I will advertise and obtain more help.  In other words, there is too much to do and perhaps, I&#39;m a little bit lazy. Ignorance Many times, I had found my self writing code, needing some dependency for it, and just making it static, not realizing that I was actively going against my project goals in the beginning.  This is why I have developed documentation so that the aims of this project are well known; not just to others, but to myself.  If it&#39;s written down, it&#39;s easier to follow. </p>

<p>Joining this ProjectAs this is an open source project anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute to it. You can contribute by making and submitting patches, working on additional engine modules, or working on your own git repository that can be pulled from occassionally. </p>

<p>Tracking This ProjectThis project can be followed various ways: </p>

<p>Join and contribute to the mailing list. http://groups.google.com/group/modularengine-discussion Follow the Modular Engine Google Calendar (Will Be Updated Soon) http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=viovf0d58b09jeaj0kj3025kfc%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago Chat on our IRC Channel (It shouldn&#39;t be hard to catch me on there): IRC Host: irc.freenode.net Room/Channel: #modular-engine You can also email me directly at:  cmptrgy412{at}gmail.com Current Stage of DevelopmentMost of the last month of development has been dedicated to porting the completed modules to linux and using GNU Make instead of VS projects. </p>

<p>The actual problem now is getting it to compile correctly using Cygwin.  I will getting it to compile correctly soon using the MinGW compiler, but I&#39;m having some difficulties linking to certain libraries. </p>

<p>After the main modules to work in both Windows and Linux, which will hopefully be very soon, work will start on a new and improved graphical user interface. The interface will be able to dynamically load and use a texture and corresponding xml file as references in creating all the interface objects such as buttons, sliders, etc.  A series of events such as OnRelease, OnHover has been implemented which will activate functors when they are triggered. </p>

<p>Questions &amp; Answers </p>

<p>Why another operating system ? </p>

<p>I am aware that a lot of operating systems are already being developped. For me the process of writting it from the scratch is part of the educational process. I do not intend to replace any existing OS. </p>

<p>What is the targeted audience ? </p>

<p>First I do it for myself. </p>

<p>I decided to share this code to help other people that are interested in OS development, and to be able to get help/suggestions from other people. </p>

<p>Why a microkernel ? </p>

<p>Because I like modularity, and I want to separate OS functions as much as possible to have a cleaner code, easier to manage, easier to understand and therefore easier to debug. Even if this flexibility has a cost. </p>

<p>Why using C++ ? </p>

<p>I do not plan to use the full C++ language, only a subset of it to make the code more readable, and to ease code management (namespaces, operators, advanced memory management). </p>

<p>I am lost </p>

CN provides a compelling alternative to existing message passing frameworks like MPI by eliminating painful administration tasks and providing a simplified programming interface. </p>

<p>Running CN on machines that share a subnet creates an ad-hoc cluster or &#39;Neighborhood&#39;.  Nodes can come online and go offline as they please.  Using a simple client API, you can write your own jobs for CN.  As the programmer, you decompose the jobs into tasks, and these tasks are distributed across the Neighborhood equitably. The tasks can communicate with one another via message passing in order to complete their work. </p>

 title : The neurospaces Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Neurospaces project is a development center for software components of computational neuroscience simulators.  This is in contrast to the monolythic software system design of current-generation neuronal simulators. </p>

<p>The first component that has been developed is a model container, a modeling system that allows to store and interact with a model in various ways. It translates a biological model to a mathematical model. A second component that was recently developed is Heccer, a fast compartmental solver that uses Crank-Nicolson integration to compute the behaviour of nerve cells. The third component is SSP, a simple lightweight scheduler, that integrates Neurospaces and Heccer and allows them to work on a simulation of a biological model. Gluing the components together gives you a very efficient neuronal network simulator that is easy to use. </p>

 summary : <p>When starting out in 2007, NHive was intended to become a new .NET Collection Library, using the C5 Collections library (version 1.0.1) as a starting point and released under a more liberal licence than the original PowerCollections collections library license.  </p>

<p>Since that time the PowerCollections library has been released under a much more liberal license on CodePlex and the NGenerics project has come up as another feasible .NET collections alternative with a liberal license. Therefore, the main incentive to spend time on this project no longer exists. </p>

<p>The code in this project may still be of interest to the following groups of developers: </p>

<p>For C5 Collection users and/or evaluators that are looking for C5 dictionary implementations that support the standard System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary interface, the code will remain available in the Subversion repository (http://nhive.googlecode.com/svn/projects/c5/tags/C5-2.0.0-alpha1/).

 summary : <p>Old Maps OnlineRepository for new software tools and patches of existing open-source tools, which are usable for libraries, archives, museums as well as individuals, who are publishing scanned old maps and other historical documents. </p>

<p>Development is supported by a R&amp;D grant DC08P02OUK006 - Old Maps Online (www.oldmapsonline.org) from Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. </p>

<p>Project objectives:Development of a technology and a pilot system to allow memory institutions to reliably georeference and publish maps and other graphic documents. The system will have the following capabilities: - it will provide online georeferencing tool for large digitised maps - it will facilitate search for digitised maps and graphics linked to a certain geographic location. It will provide user friendly interface using geographic and time information (marking an area on a map, timeline, map ranking) - it will be available in Czech and English and it will be possible to translate it into other languages. Development of methodology for online publishing of (large) old maps and other graphic documents and their georeferencing by memory institutions. Individual software tools developed by the project that could be used independently will be released under some open source license. </p>

<p>Publications:Tiles as an approach to on-line publishing of scanned old maps, vedute and other historical documents (in print). Presentation scheduled at ICA Commission on the History of Cartography - 3rd International Workshop, Barcelona, article is going to be published in e-Perimetron. Development plans:Online Georeference Tool      </p>

<p>OpenLayers: support for Zoomify Tiles patch structure (testing). </p>

<p>gcps2kml - tools for generating best transformation (ideal non-proportional bounding box with rotation) for KML from given set of GCPs. Ideal affine transformation for WorldFile. (under development). Online Georeference: online tool for specifying GCPs (Ground Control Points) for scanned documents, which are already published as Zoomify tiles/WMS/TMS (implementation: application will host probably on Google App Engine and will use OpenLayers and gcps2kml). GUI prototype Raster map warping server - for precise rectification of raster maps based on GCP database </p>

<p>Prototype of warping server - warping of raster maps using gdal tools (based partly on Jan Hartmann work).   Image Server for publication of scanned TIFF master files </p>

<p>IIPImage: patch for Zoomify tiles support - a free image server for serving tiles directly from TIFF master file (under development). 3D Presentation of already published maps </p>

<p>Python KML SuperOverlay server for remote Zoomify/TMS tiles. WMS availability of maps published as tiles </p>

<p>MapServer: patch to support of the reprojection for online tiles (TMS/Zoomify) (implemented directly or trough GDAL driver). High-quality on-line search interface for collection of historical maps  </p>

<p>Web Search Interface for searching of the map collections: An area on the map + range on the time line + fulltext. Search with ranking: Search will use  index and  algorithm. Search Indexer - with support for metadata import trough OAI-PMH, ... Possible improvement of existing tools for simplify switch to JPEG2000:IIPImage JPEG2000 support - by GDAL/FWTools linking (usage of JPEG2000 Kakadu library). Simple GUI tools for GDAL tools (gdal_translate, gdalwarp, gdal2tiles). Supported on-line publication format of scanned images:Mainly: Zoomify tiles for non-georeferenced images. For georeferenced images: a WMS service  or tiled WMS-C/TMS. </p>

<p>Possibly also non-georeferenced images trought WMS, and plain JPEG/JPEG2000/TIFF available at given url. Maybe DjVu formats and images available trough MrSID server or ECWD protocol.</p>

 summary : <p>Peppy Plugin DevelopmentThis is the homepage for plugin development for peppy.   </p>

<p>Peppy is an extensible framework in Python that can support editing and viewing many different types of files.  It features a multi-window, multi-tabbed user interface based on the emacs concept of &quot;major modes&quot;.  Like emacs, it supports viewing and editing of many different types of files, not just text files or source code. The primary target is still source code editing; however, unlike most other editors peppy is not limited to just editing text.  Evidence of its flexibility are major modes for editing binary data, controlling a music player daemon, and viewing arbitrarily large (multi-gigabyte) hyperspectral images. </p>

<p>About PluginsThe peppy application is extensible through python distutils and eggs.  This site is primarily used to host plugin development of those modules that are independent of the development of the main application, have dependencies that are beyond the scope of the main release, or use native code.</p>

 title : The pyrering Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PyreRingTestrunner to manage command line test scriptsObjectiveThe goal and inspiration for PyreRing is to develop an open source test runner that will execute scripts intended to act as individual test cases. We hope that it will simplify the writing of test cases by adding the functionality, flexibility, and reduce unnecessary complexity. By removing the administrative burden that often surrounds testing, the test author can focus on writing meaningful, direct, and useful test cases. It is hoped that any project can quickly and easily install and use PyreRing with minimal knowledge of how this test harness works.  </p>

<p>BackgroundPyreRing was born out of frustration of maintaining a host of unrelated test cases. Countless days have been spent attempting to assimilate the various results, keep track of different requirements, and differentiating test cases failures from harness errors. PyreRing is written in Python.  Python was chosen because it is easy to understand, powerful, and quite frankly it&#39;s fun to play with. This in no way limits what your test cases may be written in.  As long as you wrap your test cases with a Unix shell or scripted language wrapper, it will be executed.  </p>

<p>PyreRing&#39;s strength lies not just in running the individual test cases that you&#39;ve created; it&#39;s capable of running the resulting test suites that are comprised of the battery of test cases that you&#39;ve produced.  Furthermore, PyreRing will add the following capabilities: </p>

<p>Set a timeout value Send reports to email addresses Automatically organize your test cases by filesystem directories or suite files that you define Create automatic suites based on a predefined block in your test scripts Captures standard out and standard error into a comprehensive log </p>

 title : The quodlibet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Are you sick of audio players that think they know how to organize your music for you? Do other media libraries choke and die after a mere 10,000 songs? Do you often find yourself thinking Boy, I wish I could grep my music? Or are you just looking for something that can tag your audio files?  </p>

<p>Quod Libet &amp; Ex FalsoQuod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python. It&#39;s designed around the idea that you know how to organize your music better than we do. It lets you make playlists based on regular expressions (don&#39;t worry, regular searches work too). It lets you display and edit any tags you want in the file. And it lets you do this for all the file formats it supports -- Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Musepack, and MOD. </p>

<p>Quod Libet easily scales to libraries of thousands of songs. It also supports most of the features you expect from a modern media player, like Unicode support, multimedia keys, and tag editing. </p>

<p>Ex Falso is a program that uses the same tag editing backend as Quod Libet, but isn&#39;t connected to an audio player. If you&#39;re perfectly happy with your favorite player and just want something that can handle tagging, Ex Falso is for you. </p>

<p>Ex Falso and Quod Libet have been tested on many GNU/Linux distributions, and we&#39;ve heard it can run on FreeBSD. Anywhere with GTK+ 2.10, Python, and an OSS or ALSA compatible audio device should be able to use it.</p>

 title : The remote-testbed Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Re-Mote Testbed Framework is a collection of modules for providing remote access to wireless sensor network testbeds with a main focus on modularity, abstraction levels, and responsiveness. The components of the framework fall into three categories: Client software, server software and host/gateway software. The client is a Java based GUI featuring mote console windows useful for debugging applications. The server software consists of a mote server daemon written in C++, a relational database based on MySQL, and a mote information server based on Apache Tomcat and Axis. The host software is a mote host daemon written in C++ with site specific configuration in shell scripts. </p>

<p>Getting StartedIf you are using the Re-Mote client basic information is available in the UserManual. If you are deploying a testbed see the AdministratorManual and read the SecurityConsiderations. If you want to contribute read the DeveloperManual and take a look at the RoadMap to get an idea of what needs work. Questions and Bug ReportingQuestions can be mailed to the mailing list. All discussions related to testbeds and sensor networks are welcome. Note, first time posters are moderated to prevent spam. </p>

<p>If you found a bug in the client or one of the other components, please enter it into the issue tracker. If the bug has already been reported you are encouraged to add extra information as a comment. This will help to confirm that it is reproducible and raise the attention of developers. </p>

<p>CreditThe project is being developed in collaboration between DIKU and CIT and headed by Jonas Fonseca and Rostislav Špinar. The initial work was done by Jan Flora and Esben Zeuthen at DIKU under the supervision of Philippe Bonnet. </p>

 summary : <p>The RpgSdk is a multi platform software development kit used to aid in the construction of computer role playing games. It provides a framework that eases the manipulation and interaction of game data. Among computer RPGs, there is a common theme of what types of data is used. The SDK captures that theme in a generic way that enables the implementation of custom rule sets through a plug-in type of architecture. </p>

 title : The Project Europa Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SB_DKP is, first and foremost, developed for easier tracking of DKP for my guild on Balnazzar-EU, Serious Business. But since there are no trade secrets or security holes in the addon (and I&#39;d REALLY like a place to keep the source controlled), it seemed like a nice thing to upload it. The addon is not yet mature enough to work out-of-the-box for people not in Serious Business, as it requires a static data file with DKP values in its current state. Future releases will see a more independant approach, with the eqDKP script used for external data included. What to expect: - a good look into slash commands and smart ways of accomplishing them, as well as a good basis for anyone wishing to learn the very basics of UI work.</p>

 summary : <p>Linear and non-linear optimization solvers designed for OpenOffice.org Calc. </p>

<p>IntroductionThe goal of this project is to develop a Calc add-on component that solves a constrained linear or non-linear programming model for an optimum solution. An optimum solution in this case is defined as a feasible point that either maximizes or minimizes the objective function while satisfying all given constraints. </p>

<p>Please note that the Go-oo variant of OpenOffice.org ships scsolver as the default Solver for Calc.  So if you use Go-oo, you don&#39;t need to install scsolver as a separate extension package. </p>

 title : The shepting Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>These projects represent my homework and small projects that likely no one else will really want to look at. If you do though, feel free to suggest any improvements or use the code for the base of your own project. I&#39;m most proud of the Configs files as I use them on every new Linux/Solaris/Mac OS X computer I create a new user on. Just one SVN checkout and I can have all my shortcuts and aliases right there. That&#39;s efficiency! </p>

<p>ConfigsThis project is a collection of my configuration file for bash and emacs that reside in the home folder on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X in my case). It also has a Python script to make symbolic links to these files in the users home directory. That way, you can update this checked-out project to the latest version and all the linked files are automatically updated. </p>

<p>Purlieus 500This is a completed project for a microcontroller class we had in 2006. It is an assembly language program for an HC9S12 microcontroller, which parses a stream of NMEA input data from a GPS, and lights up LEDs corresponding to the correct direction you wish to go. I&#39;m pretty proud of the code segmentation and the string parsing. code </p>

 summary : <p>SKUA is a project with co-Is Norman Gray (project manager) and Tony Linde of the University of Leicester, funded by JISC from Jan&#39;08 to Jun&#39;09. </p>

<p>From the proposal:We propose the creation of a semantic infrastructure for astronomy based on the organisation of assertion services with relatively simple interfaces. To date, relatively little work has been done within the Virtual Observatory (VO) on semantic systems development. Our project will provide a service-based semantic infrastructure, with toolkit and SOA API, which will make it easy for many more VO developers to engage with semantic technology, and embed it in their applications. The key benefit of this proposal is that it engages with an existing vibrant development and user community, and builds upon working infrastructure, making it possible to demonstrate and prove both concepts and tools as we develop them. The proposed infrastructure will support tagging by design, allowing us, and our users, to experiment with emergent Web-2.0 approaches to social collaboration. This is an integration project, helping client authors find resources and services, tying together existing technology in a new, semantically enhanced and sustainable, context.</p>
 title : The slapkg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>About slapkgslapkg is a next generation package manager for Slackware Linux. It is fast and highly compatible with standard Slackware package management tools. Additionally, it can download, install or upgrade packages from standard Slackware mirrors. </p>

<p>NewsJuly 15th, 2008 - We are currently moving stuff to the new home page: http://localhost.ba/Slackware/Slapkg. I&#39;ve got tired of google wiki, we also don&#39;t use svn or google issue tracker. </p>

<p>June 23rd, 2008 - Version 0.6.2 released with major bugfixes for Slackware 12.1. Upstream python bug was fixed and our workaround was creating big problems. As a result, directory names were not properly recorded during package installation. If you used slapkg on Slackware 12.1, you must fix it as soon as possible. We will prepare a small script for that task, until than, append &quot;/&quot; to directory names in /var/log/packages/ (only for packages installed with slapkg) </p>

<p>June 3rd, 2008 - Version 0.6.1 released, minor cleanups. </p>

<p>May 6th, 2008 - Version 0.6.0 released, Sample pkgtool compatible frontends; SlackBuild is distributed with source code archive. </p>

<p>Raison d&#39;etreContrary to popular belief, Slackware has excellent, well thought out, package management system. Package format is very simple, package database is in clear text format, easily processed by various tools (and, if need arises, fixable with any text editor and gnu tar). By design, pkgtool doesn&#39;t handle package dependencies, and we like it that way, thank you. </p>

<p>But alas, pkgtool is written in BASH, which is a great scripting language/shell, but not really well suited for text processing. Other than unpacking package archives, pkgtool spends most of its time parsing textual files, over and over again (and it&#39;s rather slow). </p>

<p>I thought I could do better and created a test version in more apropriate, high level language (Python). The results were promising, less code, speed comparable to pkgtool when installing packages, and much faster for package removal or upgrade. Fast forward one year, I finally have had some time to refactor code and write some documentation. Both are now good enough for general consumption. </p>

<p>GoalsFaster and more maintainable pkgtools (see PerformanceTests) Integrated remote updates (I happen to like slackpkg, but it&#39;s dog slow) Getting startedFirst read installation instructions. You can install from source, or you can create and install proper Slackware package (we provide build script). At some point in future, we should be 100% compatible with pkgtool, so you don&#39;t have to learn strange new commands if you don&#39;t want to. For more curious folks, we provide all-in-one command line program named slapkg which replaces various pkgtool scripts (installpkg, removepkg, upgradepkg). </p>

<p>One notable difference from pkgtool is that you can interrupt long operations using CTRL+C. e.g. you issued upgradepkg .tgz, pressing CTRL+C once will quit after installing current package, and pressing CTRL+C twice will quit immediately (leaving your package database in inconsistent state). </p>

<p>ContributingAny help is appreciated, bug testing, documentation, artwork or python coding skills. You can help us even if you only use the software (just let us know if you have any problems). Bug reports should be submitted to issue tracker and discussed on the mailing list. All code contributions must use the same license as slapkg, ditto for documentation. </p>

 summary : <p>In the context of Software Engineering, Software Process defines a set of activities, roles and artifacts that are used throughout an application’s lifecycle. The Object Management Group (OMG) created the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) in order to better represent and design software process. However, artifacts in SPEM are represented as monolithic documents of loosely information, which means they are primarily manipulated by word processors and have limited potential to formalization. The challenge is to build software artifacts that can better be controlled, managed and formalized. In this project we present ongoing work in extending SPEM to represents artifacts as structured documents in a way that artifact information content can be manipulated by tools other than word processors thus enhancing the amount of control during the software process. Moreover structuring artifacts properly allows content reuse through different artifacts, which avoid redundancy and misinterpretation.</p>

 summary : <p>The RosaryDSSay, learn, and practice saying the Rosary on a Nintendo DS!  A wonderful new way to enjoy this traditional Christocentric prayer. Do you need an easy way to brush-up on your Hail Marys, Our Fathers, Apostles&#39; Creed, and Glory Be to the Father prayers? Try out The RosaryDS. </p>

<p>screenshots</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FeaturesLearn and practice the Rosary prayers while reading the screen. Press the &#39;Pray with Me&#39; button for a voice to read with you. Automatically knows the day and date for the Mystery scriptures. Extras feature. What is the Rosary?The Rosary is made up of twenty &quot;mysteries&quot; (significant events or moments in the life of Jesus and Mary), which, following the Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, are grouped into four series.  The Rosary is made of beads which represent which prayer is to be recited. Normally, the person saying the rosary holds on to the current bead in which they are reciting. </p>

<p>The first of the four mysteries contains joyful mysteries (recited on Mondays and Saturdays); the second, the mysteries of light (Thursdays); the third, the sorrowful mysteries (Tuesdays and Fridays); and the fourth, the glorious mysteries (Wednesdays and Sundays). </p>

<p>&quot;This indication is not intended to limit a rightful freedom in personal and community prayer, where account needs to be taken of spiritual and pastoral needs and of the occurrence of particular liturgical celebrations which might call for suitable adaptations.&quot;  (Rosarium Virginis Mariae, 38). </p>

<p>Ways to use The RosaryDSThere are basically two ways to use The RosaryDS. On your PC and on your NintendoDS. </p>

<p>Use a NintendoDS EmulatorDownload a NintendoDS Emulator. I recommend DeSmuME (for .nds files) or no$gba (with .gba files) Use MicroSD Card on Real NintendoDSPurchase the R4 Revolution for DS (or similar product) Purchase a 1GB or 2GB (only, nothing greater than 2GB will work) MicroSD memory for R4 Setup the R4 and load TheRosaryDS.nds.

 title : The transmissionlab Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This package contains the TransmissionLab model, written to allow simulation of cultural transmission and evolution phenomena.  The goal of TransmissionLab is to accurately represent theoretical models of CT (e.g., random copying, prestige-biased transmission, frequency-biased transmission) within a variety of population structures (e.g., complete graphs/well-mixed,  sparse random graphs and social networks of varying topologies, spatial lattices), and using  a variety of update algorithms (e.g., Moran processes, Wright-Fisher processes, various other birth-death processes).  TransmissionLab seeks to also make data collection and  &#39;observation&#39; of simulated populations simple, with modules which are completely separate from the simulated population itself thus preventing observational &#39;side-effects&#39; on the model.   Analysis flows from data collection, and can be done in a variety of ways. </p>

<p>Binary distributions of the simulation model are available under the Downloads tab, in the form of a jar file and an associated zip archive of library dependencies.  Source code is available on the Source tab, via anonymous Subversion repository access. </p>

<p>We encourage you to read and familiarize yourself with the README, License, and GPL.txt files contained in the source distribution.  These govern source and binary distributions of TransmissionLab, including your rights to distribute and modify TransmissionLab.  In addition, these files indicate that no warranties, express or implied, are provided for TransmissionLab.  The suitability and fitness of TransmissionLab for any specific purpose or project is not guaranteed by the authors; although we are naturally happy to discuss issues relating to the scientific accuracy and behavior of the system, since our goal here is to produce a system useful not just for our own research, but for others to use.</p>

 title : The tvac Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps is in need of a technology upgrade.  At the present time, they are using paper forms and files for nearly all of their record keeping.  The first step towards a modern data storage/retrieval solution would be to convert their paper &quot;call sheets&quot; into a software system.  The sheet is two sided and includes information such as who went on the call, relevant times, patient info, injury, treatment, etc.  Call sheets are used for record keeping and are often subpoenaed for legal purposes. </p>

<p>The HeatWave team proposes a three part system to support the basic requirements for electronic call sheets.  The first subsystem is a centralized data store for the call sheets that responds to actions and requests from the two user subsystems.  The user subsystems are client programs that provide a call sheet interface similar to the paper version with which the EMTs are already familiar.  One client program will allow the creation of new call sheets to be entered into the data store, while the other will allow the user to search the data store based on several criteria and access previous records.  It is necessary to separate these programs because call sheets have special legal status and can only be accessed under special circumstances.  Ultimately, we would like to allow EMTs to take tablet PCs or PDAs with them on call to record the data to avoid the duplicate work of taking down notes during a call and transfering the data into the system upon return to the station.  The search client will only be run on TVAC&#39;s LAN, while the call sheet creation client will be run on a wide array of desktops, laptops, palmtops, tablet PCs, and PDAs all of which can communicate with the data store simultaneously.</p>

However, my computer is having problems seeding so it is preferred that you use Megaupload.winChain has been updated to 1.0.1 to fix the bug with copying files. 1.0.2 is imminent and will fix the bug with the Cygwin button being greyed out. Until then, just run the installer in the Resources folder.The preBuiltToolchain file can be downloaded from here, or if you prefer BitTorrent, at TPB.winChain is simple: Download the builder software from the Downloads section, then download the 500mb pre-Built Toolchain files from the MegaUpload link. Then simply run winChain, direct it to preBuiltToolchain.zip, and let it work its magic. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll go something like this: </p>

<p>You&#39;ll download the two files. You&#39;ll download WinRAR and extract preBuiltToolchain.rar. You run winChain.exe and it&#39;ll ask for the preBuiltToolchain folder. You&#39;ll wait a little while as winChain copies the file (it should only take a second). winChain will launch the Cygwin installer. You just have to keep clicking &quot;Next&quot; until it completes... no special options or anything. winChain will alert you that you&#39;re good to go, and put a Cygwin shortcut on your Desktop. You can now use Cygwin to built iPhone apps. To test, navigate to &quot;/HelloApplication&quot; in Cygwin and type in &quot;make&quot; and the Hello World application should build. winChain also includes a iPhone application template builder (&quot;winChain Template Builder.exe&quot;), and an option to install Notepad++ (in my opinion, the best code-notepad out there), so that you can be coding in no time. </p>

<p>Feel free to contact me if you have problems getting winChain to work, or if you need some programming help :) You can contact me at winchainbuilder@gmail.com. Please don&#39;t send winChain-related emails to idemocracy@gmail.com! </p>

 summary : <p>We&#39;ve been using Erlang in commercial products for over 10 years now, and it&#39;s taken about that long to get into a position where we&#39;re considered a viable player for mission-critical product development. In order to get there, we&#39;ve also been extolling the virtues of functional programming in general, and often cited Ocaml as an example of how you don&#39;t have to sacrifice low-level performance. </p>

<p>We feel that the ongoing paradigm shift towards multicore architectures is really helping our cause. There is much discussion about how to get all those legacy apps to work and scale on new hardware, and the advantages of functional/declarative programming are becoming more obvious. </p>

<p>Erlang is very strong in the area of concurrency, distribution and fault-tolerance, but fairly weak when sequential performance is of the essence (especially number crunching). When Erlang performance isn&#39;t enough, we usually jump into C-routines linked into the Erlang runtime, with all the problems associated with that. Often, instead of risking system integrity, we live with the performance we can get out of Erlang. It would be nice if we could present Ocaml as a safe (and productive!) driver environment for things like parsing text-based protocols, numerically intensive tasks, and complex sequential algorithms. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that there have been some discussions about concurrency in Ocaml. From an Ocaml perspective, this binding could be a way to use Ocaml in distributed systems, where Erlang is used as a &quot;systems glue&quot; for supervision, load balancing, replication, etc. </p>

<p>Idea:  </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to explore the idea of running an Ocaml runtime in Erlang&#39;s memory space. Both languages are garbage-collected, and Erlang&#39;s linked-in driver interface allows for &quot;drivers&quot; that use their own threads. We could target only the multi-processor variant of Erlang, where this sort of cooperation becomes slightly easier. </p>

<p>For a looser connection, Erlang&#39;s distribution protocol is documented, and allows for &quot;C-nodes&quot; (non-Erlang nodes) to connect to an Erlang cluster over TCP. One could actually start with talking via regular pipes, using a common serialization format, and then gradually making a tighter and tigher connection. </p>

<p>I will make no false promises, like &quot;if we do this, Ericsson will use it&quot;. I have no money to offer anyone, and we who have started looking at this on the erlang side have fairly little time to spend on it. Business as usual, in other words: no time, no money - just an idea that might be fun to explore. </p>

 title : The functional-javascript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Functional is a library for functional programming in JavaScript. It defines the standard higher-order functions such as map, reduce (aka foldl), and select (aka filter). It also defines functions such as curry, rcurry, and partial for partial function application; and compose, guard, and until  for function-level  programming. And all these functions accept strings, such as &#39;x -&gt; x+1&#39;, &#39;x+1&#39;, or &#39;+1&#39; as synonyms for the more verbose function(x) {return x+1}. </p>

<p>Functional lets you write code such as this: </p>

<p>  map(&#39;x+1&#39;, [1,2,3])
<br/>  select(&#39;x&gt;2&#39;, [1,2,3,4])
<br/>  some(&#39;_.length &lt; 3&#39;, &#39;are there any short words?&#39;.split(&#39; &#39;))</p>

<p>  // double the items in a list
<br/>  map(&#39;_/2&#39;, [1,2,3])
<br/>  // find the odd numbers
<br/>  filter(&#39;%2&#39;, [1,2,3,4])
<br/>  // or the evens
<br/>  filter(not(&#39;%2&#39;), [1,2,3,4])</p>

<p>  Array.prototype.sum = reduce.curry(&#39;+&#39;, 0).compose(&#39;this&#39;)
<br/>  [1,2,3].sum()</p>

 title : The gmemsess Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>gmemsessgmemsess is a secure lightweight memcache-backed session class for Google appengine. It is only suitable for short-term sessions, for providing your own authentication system or shopping cart, for instance. gmemsess is in use in at least one commercial application, and depending on memcache for data storage (rather than the datastore) has now been well proven. </p>

<p>Security Featuresgmemsess works by storing an eight-character session ID in a cookie on the client&#39;s browser. Each character can be an upper- or lower-case letter, giving almost 10^14 (hundred trillion) possible session IDs, so an attacker trying to guess the session ID will take rather a long time. </p>

<p>Apart from the session ID, all session data is stored in appengine&#39;s memcache, so attackers cannot access it (unless they hack appengine, in which case everything is lost anyway). </p>

<p>MemcacheMemcache has benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are that it is fast and it&#39;s timeout feature handles session timeouts neatly, allowing gmemsess to be much smaller (and faster). </p>

<p>The main drawback is that memcache does not guarantee storage in any way. According to Google, it may disappear at any time, when resources are limited, or the memcache system is reset for instance. This means sessions may die mysteriously, and your users will have to log back in, or start shopping again. In practise this does not seem to happen. </p>

<p>Long Term SessionsTo handle long term sessions (days/weeks/months), gmemsess would need significant changes to make it write to the datastore as well as memcache. If you need this, please contact me at greg@vig.co.nz.  </p>

<p>Integration with Django, CherryPy, WebPy...There have been some requests to modify gmemsess to work with the various web frameworks. I&#39;m reluctant to do this because it will more than double the size and complexity of the code, and I love simplicity.  </p>

<p>Simplicity means you can&#39;t use gmemsess with your framework out of the box - but it also means that it is easy to modify gmemsess any way you want. Have a look at the code in gemmesess.py - I think you&#39;ll be surprised how little there is. All you need to do is pass your framework&#39;s container into gmemsess instead of the request handler rh, and then use the container&#39;s request and response objects instead of rh.request and rh.response. See here for an example for CherryPy. </p>

<p>Another solution is to send your framework&#39;s developers a link to gmemmsess - again, that simplicity means they should be able to integrate it into their framework with little trouble. Most frameworks seem to need modifications for AppEngine, so it makes sense to build gmemsess directly into the framework. </p>

<p>Documentation__init__(rh,name,timeout)Create a session object. 
<br/>rh -- the parent&#39;s request handler (usually self) name -- the cookie name (defaults to &quot;gsid&quot;) timeout -- the number of seconds the session will last between requests (defaults to 1800 secs - 30 minutes) invalidate()Delete session data and cookie. 
<br/>is_new()Returns True if session was created during this request. 
<br/>get_id()Returns the session ID as a string. 
<br/>save()Save session data. No arguments. 
<br/>Using gmemsessA gmemsess session works just like a python dictionary, so you can add as many key/value pairs as you like. To get started, download gmemsess1.4.zip and extract gmemsess.py into your project directory. </p>

<p>In your code, add import gmemsess To make a session called sess, add sess=gmemsess.Session(self) To find out if this is a new session, use if sess.is_new(): To store something, use sess[&#39;something&#39;]=&#39;Do as you would be done to&#39; Access or change something with sess[&#39;something&#39;] To delete something, use del sess[&#39;something&#39;] After storing/changing/deleting something, do sess.save() to make it permanent To end the session, use sess.invalidate() </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a really simple example: </p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env python</p>

<p>import gmemsess
<br/>import wsgiref.handlers
<br/>from google.appengine.ext import webapp</p>

<p>#----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>class MainHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
<br/>	#----------------------------------------------------------
<br/>	def get(self):
<br/>		sess=gmemsess.Session(self)
<br/>		if sess.is_new():
<br/>			self.response.out.write(&#39;New session - setting counter to 0.
<br/>&#39;)
<br/>			sess[&#39;myCounter&#39;]=0
<br/>			sess.save()
<br/>		else:
<br/>			sess[&#39;myCounter&#39;]+=1
<br/>			self.response.out.write(&#39;Session counter is %d.&#39;%sess[&#39;myCounter&#39;])
<br/>			if sess[&#39;myCounter&#39;]Hit your browser&#39;s refresh button several times to see it working.</p>

 title : The imgmap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>With the imagemap editor you can easily draw ALL the standard image map shapes (rectangle, circle, polygon), and you can have full control over the generated HTML code as well. </p>

<p>The editor natively uses the canvas HTML element to draw the shapes on a given image. The ExplorerCanvas library from Google is used to get the same result in browsers, that does not support the canvas element but can use VML instead. ExplorerCanvas works quite well, however it is still beta quality, and not as fast as the native canvas drawing, so expect some lags in IE. The editor is currently tested to work in FFX 1.5/2/3, Safari 3, Opera 9/10 and IE 6/7/8.</p>

 title : The jconch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GoalThe goal of the jconch project is to produce a reliable, safe set of implementations for common tasks in mulithreaded Java applications.  The goal is to be similar in spirit to the way that Spring scraps the boilerplate for common user tasks in database work. </p>

<p>Current FunctionalityLogical Equivalence Locking -- Both synchronized and ReadWriteLock-based based on logical equivalence (#equals) instead of reference equality (==). Thread-safe Lazy Map -- Good for caching look-ups in a multithreaded environment.  Use this to substantially improve performance in cases where repeated expensive look-ups are occurring. Fast, Thread-safe Multiple-Key Objects -- For when storing one object as a key to a map just isn&#39;t enough. Easy Spring Integration -- Architected with an eye towards making life easy for Spring users. Might Someday Do List(If you want this stuff, vote for the issue.) </p>

<p>Generic Functors -- Versions of Commons-Collections functors that have type information.  Naturally Multithreaded Producer/Consumer Chains -- An easy way of representing distinct stages of a pipeline and configuring their threading model. Groovy-based Pipeline Builder -- Because Groovy&#39;s Builders are cool. </p>

<p>Want to Keep Up-To-Date?You can get notices when things happen with JConch by subscribing to the JConch mailing list.  Just send an e-mail to jconch-subscribe@googlegroups.com.  Messages will all be prepended with [jconch], so it&#39;ll be easy to create a rule to handle them. You can also subscribe to the JConch RSS feed if you don&#39;t feel like sharing your e-mail address. </p>

<p>Requirements for UseJava 1.5 or later Commons-Lang and Commons-Collections, which any respectable Java application should probably already have in play.  The specific versions used in development are provided in the &quot;dep&quot; archive (see Downloads). What&#39;s In a Name?While the project started out as the Java CONCurrency Handler, it&#39;s taken on an additional meaning through an idiosyncracy.  The conch has been a symbol of deciding who gets a turn to speak in meetings, probably based on its use as such in &#39;Lord of the Flies&#39;.  That seems very fitting for a concurrency system! </p>

<p>What about java.util.concurrent?This package requires a Java5 or greater JRE.  While Java5 added many low-level concurrency tools (which are used in this class), it does not provide &#39;grab-and-go&#39; solutions for common concurrency problems.  For instance, while it provides Semaphore and CompletionService, useful tools for development, it does not provide an actual producer/consumer framework. </p>

<p>Who is Behind All This?As of now, all development has been done by Robert Fischer of Smokejumper Consulting.  If you&#39;ve got tricky concurrency problems or just generally need some expertise on Java/Groovy development, drop him a line.</p>

 summary : <p>Boost.Join is an asynchronous, message based C++ concurrency library based on Join calculus. It is applicable both to multi-threaded applications and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based applications. It follows Comega&#39;s design and implementation and builds with Boost facilities.

 title : The jqmock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jqMock is a lightweight javascript Mock Framework for the jqUnit testing framework. jqMock allows functions in dependent functions such as native alert dialogs to be mocked, so that your own code can be tested in isolation. </p>

<p>jqMock has comprehensive expectation support, with complex argument matching criteria, ordered/unordered expectations, multiplicity control, intercepting return values and throwing exceptions.  </p>

<p>See the user guide hereLeave a comment on my blog here.InterceptingIntercept functions so you can write your unit test in isolation. </p>

<p>jqUnit.test(&#39;hello world test&#39;, function() {
<br/>    var alertMock = new jqMock.Mock(window, &#39;alert&#39;);
<br/>    alertMock.modify().args(&#39;hello world!&#39;).multiplicity(2).returnValue();
<br/>    hello();
<br/>    hello();
<br/>    alertMock.verify();
<br/>    alertMock.restore();
<br/>});Better AssertionjqMock provides an assertion function assertThat which allows you to setup powerful and flexible expectations by providing a comprehensive set of expressions. Even if you do not use this framework for mocking, assertThat is a very useful addition to the jqUnit toolset. For example: </p>

<p>jqMock.assertThat(3,3);
<br/>jqMock.assertThat([1,2,3],[1,2,3]);	
<br/>jqMock.assertThat({a:&#39;a&#39;,b:&#39;b&#39;}, {b:&#39;b&#39;, a:&#39;a&#39;});
<br/>jqMock.assertThat([1,2,3], is.instanceOf(Array));
<br/>jqMock.assertThat(&#39;foo&#39;, is.anyOf([&#39;foo&#39;,&#39;bar&#39;]));
<br/>jqMock.assertThat(myobject, is.allOf([is.instanceOf(MyObject),{x:&#39;x&#39;}]));Detailed Error MessagesError messages are clear and explicit, and failures are presented with full details of the satisfaction state.</p>

 summary : <p>LocationAPITools library, version 1.0.1Summary:A collection of classes that simplify the development of location-aware mobile applications using the JSR-179 Location API on the J2ME (CLDC/MIDP) platform, e.g. on GPS-equipped smartphones. </p>

<p>Author:Matthias Stevens (Sony CSL Paris / Vrije Universiteit Brussel) </p>

<p>Description:The primary use case is a location tracker that stores tracks in KML (cfr. Google Earth/Maps), CSV or plain text format. </p>

<p>Package com.sony.csl.j2me.locationapitools.demo contains a MIDlet class that demonstrates how LocationAPITools can be used to create simple GPS tracker application that produces KML files. For examples of more advanced uses of this library refer to the NoiseTube project (see below, look for NoiseTube MobileNoiseTagger). </p>

<p>The code is known to be working on the following Symbian OS-based platforms: </p>

<p>S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (Symbian OS 9.2), e.g.: Nokia N95 and Nokia N95 8GB smartphones S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 (Symbian OS 9.3) Although this is untested, the code should also work on other (non-Symbian/S60) J2ME CLDC/MIDP platforms/devices, as long as the JSR-179 Location API is supported on the platform/device in question. </p>

<p>This library was developed within the scope of the NoiseTube project at Sony Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) Paris, for more information please refer to: </p>

 summary : <p>A script based library to create and manage Metalink download files, which contain HTTP, FTP, rsync and P2P download links for single or multiple download files. </p>

<p>In addition, single-file BitTorrent files can be generated as well as imported. </p>

<p>The Python version is generally faster than the PHP version, especially for large files. But both versions offer exactly the same functionality, except for 32-bit limitations of PHP resulting in wrong </p>

<p> tags after scanning files bigger than 2 GB, which have to be manually corrected. </p>

<p>The library is a fork of the Metalink Editor by Hampus Wessman. </p>

<p>Please report bugs and feature requests in the Issues list. </p>

<p>For convenience the library provides a command-line interface. </p>

<p>Usage: metalink.py [FILE|DIRECTORY]...</p>

<p>Create Metalink and BitTorrent files by parsing download files.
<br/>Helper files will be searched and parsed automatically:
<br/>.metalink, .torrent, .mirrors, .md5, .sha1, .sha256 (sum, SUMS), .sig.
<br/>Glob wildcard expressions are allowed for filenames (openproj-0.9.6*).
<br/>Torrents will only be created for single files with chunks (parsed or scanned).
<br/>Chunks will only be imported from single-file torrents.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p># Parse file1, search helper files file1.* and generate file1.metalink.
<br/># In addition, create file1.torrent (if exists, create file1.torrent.new).
<br/>metalink.py file1 --create-torrent=http://linuxtracker.org/announce.php</p>

<p># Parse directory, search download and helper files *.* and generate
<br/># *.metalink for all non-helper files bigger than 1 MB.
<br/># First metalink file with no download file match will be the template
<br/># for download files with no corresponding metalink file.
<br/>metalink.py directory</p>

<p># Upgrade to new release with single metalink template.
<br/>metalink.py --version=1.1 file-1.0.zip.metalink file-1.1*</p>

<p># Update file-1.0*.metalink files with new version number 1.1,
<br/># parse file-1.1* and file-1.1*.torrent and generate file-1.1*.metalink.
<br/>metalink.py --version=1.1 file-1.0*.metalink</p>

<p># Define URL prefix to save the original .metalink download URL:
<br/># http://openoffice.org/url/prefix/file1.metalink
<br/>metalink.py http://openoffice.org/url/prefix/ file1</p>

<p>Options:
<br/> --create-torrent=URLs  Create torrent with given tracker URLs (comma separates groups, space separates group members: &quot;t1, t2a t2b&quot;)
<br/> --overwrite            Overwrite existing files (otherwise append .new)
<br/> -t, --template=FILE    Metalink template file
<br/> --url-prefix=URL       URL prefix (where metalink should be placed online)
<br/> -v, --verbose          Verbose output
<br/> -V                     Show program version and exit

 summary : <p>MultiCurl class library is a solution for work with MULTI CURL PHP extension. It provides to execute some parallel HTTP requests with limit of downloaded size. Example: start 100 downloads with 2 parallel sessions, and get only first 100 Kb per session. </p>

<p>Supported features: </p>

<p>- Set query for CURL multi sessions. The main idea you can use only limited number of parallel requests. If you add next request, and the query is fully filled, the script waits while one or some previous CURL multi sessions will be completed. </p>

<p>- Set maximal size limit for downloaded content. Please note: it is possible to download rather more bytes than the limit because download operation uses internal buffer. </p>

<p>- Set common CURL options for all requests.   - Set separate CURL options for different requests if it is necessary. </p>

<p>- Use callback events for response result processing. </p>

<p>- If you use MultiCurl class library you don&#39;t need to use complicated PHP functions like curl_multi_init, curl_multi_add_handle, curl_multi_select, curl_multi_exec, etc. You can use only very simple and useful API.</p>

 summary : <p>paws - A PHP library for AWS - Amazon Web Services  </p>

<p>About this LibraryThis library currently provides a high level, natural PHP programming style interface to AWS SimpleDB. It will eventually be extended to include S3 and EC2. </p>

<p>It relies on the standard Amazon_SimpleDB library, but wraps it in an easy to use class that makes it trivial to use SimpleDB with PHP. It is very small, and comes with complete documentation explaining each function of the class and provides usage examples. </p>

<p>The package also includes a PHP Web application that allows you to easily access your SimpleDB online. The app, pawsDemo.php, allows you to create, delete, and list domains. You can create, modify, examine, and delete items. You can perform queries. And you can list out the contents of a domain or the whole database. This app also demonstrates use of the pawsSDB class. </p>

<p>This package is Copyright 2008 Bruce E. Wampler, and is released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License. </p>

<p>Quick StartThe source for this package can be downloaded from here:  http://code.google.com/p/paws-library/ on the download tab as a tar.gz file: pawsSDB-2008-mm-dd.tar.gz. </p>

<p>Untar the package, ideally in your root directory. This will produce a directory /aws-libs, with subdirectories /Amazon and /paws. These subdirectories contain the Amazon_SimpleDB library distribution, the paws pawsSDB class definition, some tools, and the documentation. The file /aws-libs/paws/pawsConfig.php will have to be edited to add your AWS id and password and configure the path correctly. There is plenty of detail in the documentation. </p>

<p>Online DocumentationThe complete programming reference manual is also available on line at ObjectCentral if you&#39;d like to check it out before downloading the package. Click the link in the right column of this page. </p>

 summary : <p>Update: Google has released its own Calendar/GData Python API: http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/ You may prefer to use that one :-( </p>

<p>Python library/class for working with Google Calendar API. </p>

<p>Sample Usage: import cal a = cal.googCal() a.getAuth(&#39;username@gmail.com&#39;,&#39;password&#39;) events = a.query(&#39;mom&#39;s birthday&#39;) if events: </p>

<br/>print event&#39;startTime&#39; 
<br/>print event&#39;title&#39; 
<br/>print event&#39;content&#39; </p>

<p>Notes: Until we get a setup.py working you&#39;ll need to install the following libraries as a private citizen to get things working: 1. httplib 2. libgmail  from http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/ 3. dateutil from http://labix.org/python-dateutil </p>

<p>Files: 1. cal.py is the file where everything API happens.  This is all you really need to get to work. 2. birthdays.py is a bonus program using cal.py to add birthdays to google calendar from google contacts. 3. e2.py import one day from exchange to Google Calendar 4. exchange.py Put calendar entries from exchange into your google calendar. -See &#39;Download&#39; Link on Right Sidebar </p>

<p>TODO: 0. Make setup.py and have it work. 1. Needs to offer all features of API. 2. Probably switch over to using xml dom or something? 3. Be able to choose which calendar to use 4. Handle weird Google (throttling?) errors? 5. Refactor nicely</p>

 title : The reglib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Why not behavior sheets?CSS is nice because it lets you declare styles without worrying about DOM load, traversal or having to reattach styles as the DOM gets updated over the lifetime of the page. Which raises the question, why isn&#39;t the behavior layer similarly declarative? </p>

<p>/* the style sheet */
<br/>div.menu li &gt; a { color: blue; }</p>

<p>/* why not a behavior sheet? */
<br/>div.menu li &gt; a { click: function(e) { ... }; }reglib&#39;s goal is to get as close to that as possible: </p>

<p>reg.click(&quot;div.menu li &gt; a&quot;, function(e) { ... });reglib is so named because it lets you &quot;register&quot; an event handler against a CSS selector. Like CSS, once the above code is &quot;declared&quot;, the event handling behavior takes effect globally. This is true regardless of whether the onload event has fired, or whether the DOM has finished loading off the network, or whether arbitrary sections of DOM have been overwritten. </p>

<p>Besides event declaration, this lib contains a few other convenience and helper utilities. Specifically: </p>

<p>DOM helper functions (see DomFunctions) Basic load-traverse-modify functionality (see LoadAndTraversal) A CSS (ish) selector API (see ReglibSelectors) A cross-browser event adder (see EventAdder) Whenever possible this lib takes advantage of native APIs, such as Node.getElementsByClassName() and Node.querySelector(), falling back on more laborious manual methods for doing the same things in older clients.</p>

 summary : <p>XenAccess LibraryOverviewWhen running multiple domains (or virtual machines) using the Xen hypervisor, this library will allow a privileged domain to view the runtime state of another domain. This technique is known as virtual machine introspection. The current software focuses on memory access, but also provides proof-of-concept code for disk monitoring. </p>

<p>News5 Jan 2009: XenAccess version 0.5 is now available!  This release includes greatly improved support for Windows domains, support for newer versions of Xen, lots of bug fixes, support for viewing raw memory files, a new tools directory with adapters for Python and Volatility, updated documentation, and much more.  You can download this release using the link on the right side of this page. </p>

<p>13 Aug 2008: Help wanted!  The XenAccess project is looking for motivated developers interested in helping to implement new features and improve compatibility across various Xen versions.  Knowledge in C is critical, and experience with Xen and open source projects would be useful too.  Together, we can make XenAccess a true open source alternative to VMsafe!  In you&#39;re interested, contact Bryan Payne. </p>

<p>17 Apr 2008: The project has moved to Google, instead of SourceForge.  Over the course of the next few days, we will be completing the migration including moving the mailing list to Google Groups.  Hopefully things didn&#39;t break too much in the move, but let us know if you find a problem. </p>

<p>Xen CompatibilityThe XenAccess code base requires knowledge of address translations (e.g., between physical and machine addresses) in order to work properly.  Occasionally, Xen makes changes to how these translations are done or to other details that we rely on.  To see if XenAccess is known to work with a particular version of Xen, refer to CompatibleXenVersions, a user maintained wiki page. </p>

<p>Future DirectionsThe current version of XenAccess provides for memory access between two Linux virtual machines. This is only the first step! Below is a listing (in no particular order) of the features and capabilities that will find their way into XenAccess in the future. If you&#39;re a developer and would like to help with this project, this list is a great starting point. </p>

<p>Full support for newer versions of Xen Create higher level abstractions (e.g., easier access to memory) Automatic detection of symbol locations </p>

 title : The cfxweb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome 
<br/> The components built in this project are designed to provide an easy way for ColdFusion developers to leverage the database system behind Avectra&#39;s netFORUM Enterprise.  The code is offered with sensitive information removed, therefore some environment specific configuration can be expected.  If you are using Avectra&#39;s netFORUM Pro or netFORUM Team some of the changes you will make might include namespace modifications and the addition of other authentication criteria like defining a misunderstand attribute.
<br/> 
<br/> In any case, if you have any questions or need assistance understanding or implementing any of this code, please feel to contact me - jumpin(at)iribbit.net.
<br/> </p>

<p> 2009/04/07 
<br/> It should be noted the code offered in this project is for Avectra netFORUM Enterprise v2.0 2006.2.0.12643 Build 2006_02_04.  As I understand it, there has been some significant enhancements to xWeb in more recent versions - executing Stored Procedures and meta data caching.  Both could improve the performance of requests being made and even short cut the number of calls needed, in certain circumstances.
<br/> 
<br/>  2008/03/02 
<br/> Since posting this project, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to rewrite the application that drove the creation of this code.  In the process, I&#39;ve cleaned up all the bad practices, mainly the hard coded variables in the root CFC.  These have been replaced with arguments that need to be passed in when invoking the component.  A couple other things I&#39;ve changed as well.  If there are any questions or problems, please feel free to Create an Issue in this project.
<br/> 
<br/> Other modifications include enhanced and consistent error catching across all methods.

 title : The crediare Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>THE BASIC PROBLEM IT WILL SOLVE: </p>

<p>Working as a project manager, during the process of a software project management, I identified 5 (five) extreme important aspects involved in it: PROFESSIONAL, PRODUCT, PROCESS, PROJECT and PRODUCTION. These aspects are not totally covered by the project management tools currently available on the market. In this way, I use several tools, many times without adequate integration. This lack of integration affects the project and generates an extreme load of work over me, leaving me so overloaded. 
<br/>It would be interesting, not only for me, but for any project manager, that only one software tool was used, assisting in the management of these 5 (five) aspects. An adequate and complete development methodology must be used to guarantee the integration of these aspects. Thus, the CICLONE methodology was first developed based on the CMMI model (SEI), the SPICE norm (ISO) and the PMBOK guide (PMI). 
<br/>WHAT THE SOFTWARE WILL DO: </p>

<p>Crediare will assist the project manager during the software project, either in the elaboration of the artifacts, either in accompanying the work of the team members, or even during the planning of the product (software). It will be possible for the project manager to define and follow previously a specific process for a project, so he can initiate the planning and control of the project after that. The information about the product, as requirements and design, will be registered, so after the project they will be used in the maintenance of the product.	 
<br/>The project manager will have the possibility to follow the team in an individual way, identifying the characteristics and potentials of each professional, always keeping up to date a personal and unique profile for each member of the team. During the project, the production of the software will be followed in industrial scale, with record and analysis of metrics and checkup points. 
<br/>Any or all information registered in Crediare will constitute a knowledge historical base, to be used in new projects as a base of estimates and comparative analysis reports. 
<br/>WHAT PURPOSE IT WILL SERVE: </p>

<p>The main purpose of the Crediare Software will be to automatize and to modernize the main work activities of the project manager, in the 5 (five) main aspects involved in the development of a software:  
<br/>Project, Product, Process, Professionals and Production. 
<br/>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: </p>

<p>Crediare is being developed using PHP language, with any SQL Ansi compliant database. 
<br/>TOOLS INTENDED FOR USE: </p>

<p>As a strong Open Source advocate, I am using many popular Open Source PHP frameworks for developing the Crediare application, each one for a specific purpose. And in the development and management processes, I&#39;m also using some Open Source or free tools, like Eclipse, OpenOffice, Apache Ant, Argo UML, Subversion, etc. 
<br/>	 	 OS PLATFORMS SUPPORTED: </p>

<p>Crediare will run on any PHP platform compatible Operating System: Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS, etc.</p>

 title : The findbugs-tutorials Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project hosts tutorials and other documentation that have been developed for FindBugs. FindBugs is a static analysis tool that finds coding mistakes by examining Java classfiles. FindBugs incorporates some fairly sophisticated checking for null pointer bugs, but also looks for hundreds of other bug patterns, many of which can be found using very simple techniques. FindBug has been downloaded more than 450,000 times from all over the world, and is used by a number of large open source efforts and companies. FindBugs is typically able to find hundreds of real defects/mistakes per million lines of noncommenting source statements. </p>

<p>Using FindBugs in Anger (given at OOPSLA 2007)This tutorial is designed to help attendees fully incorporate FindBugs into their software development process, with an emphasis on solving the issues that arise in using static analysis on projects with a large code base and multiple developers. We will go into substantial detail about how to perform differential analysis, which allows you to see which warnings have been introduced since the previous build, or since the last release to customers. We will also discuss persistent auditing, so that after reviewing a set of warnings and deciding which need to be fixed and which can be ignored, those audit results are applied to the results of each new analysis, so that you don&#39;t have to reexamine warnings already audited. We will also discuss how to apply annotations, including those defined by JSR-305, to allow FindBugs to better understand your own code and libraries, thus finding important bugs and suppressing unimportant issues. Finally, we will also discuss how to write your own bug detectors. </p>

<p> Running FindBugs </p>

<p> Working with XML output from FindBugs </p>

<p> Managing FindBugs and incorporating it into your software development process </p>

<p> Description of JSR-305, annotations for software defect detection </p>

<p> Writing detectors for FindBugs </p>

<p>Using FindBugs for Research (given at PLDI 2007)In addition to having many bug detectors, FindBugs also has a plug-in architecture, allowing third party detectors to be added, and FindBugs can run within a GUI, the command line, Eclipse or Netbeans. FindBugs also supports the ability to track the persistence of defects across multiple versions or instances of a piece of software, so you can see when defect warnings are introduced, how long they persist and when they are removed. </p>

<p>We believe this offers researchers an excellent opportunity to study how certain defects are created, persist and are removed. It also provides an opportunity for researchers looking to gain broader visibility for their own tools: by packaging your own analysis as a FindBugs plugin, you can gain a huge installed base of users. </p>

 title : The hackystat-analysis-boswell Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Purpose:Boswell is a system that collects user information and provides updates on development events to various micro-blogging agents and activity streams.  Examples of these micro-blogging agents and activity streams are Twitter and Facebook status updates.  The goal of Boswell is to use these development events for two main purposes: </p>

<p>Help developers work with other developers on a software project Generate an objective biography of the developer Sources for these development events include Hackystat Telemetry Analysis, Hackystat Daily Project Data Analysis, Hackystat Sensorbase, and Subversion.  Boswell would extract data from these sources and translate them into meaningful statements to be published to selected micro-blogging agents. </p>

<p>Structure: </p>

<p>For more detail of the system. Please refer to the code Documentation : JavaDoc </p>

<p>Capabilities:Currently, the system can pull data from the DailyProjectData and the SensorBase and then generate summaries to be published to Twitter and Facebook.  The types of data that can be pulled include: </p>

<p>File Saves CheckStyle errors FindBugs errors PMD errors JUnit failures Total DevTime for a 24 hour period Drop in Emma coverage    </p>

<p>An example of Boswell in action would be that every 24 hours (between 10:00pm and 12:00pm), Bowell would collect the total DevTime for the user for a given project. It would then process this information and turn it into a Twitter Tweet and/or a Facebook status update to be published on the user&#39;s Twitter and/or Facebook account. </p>

 title : The hackystat-sensor-visualstudio Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to the project homepage for the Hackystat Visual Studio sensor! </p>

<p>Hackystat-Sensor-VisualStudio is a development project to build a Hackystat sensor that collects software development metrics for Microsoft Visual Studio.  </p>

<p>Hackystat is an open source framework for collection and analysis of software development process and product data. Data collected by this sensor will be sent to a web service called the Hackystat SensorBase for storage and can be accessed through the Project Browser.  </p>

<p>This sensor is intended to be easy to setup and collection of data is done in an unobtrusive manner. After the first configuration of the sensor in Visual Studio to provide the developer&#39;s Hackystat account information, developers do not have to be clicking any button or typing in any commands again to control the sensor&#39;s activity. The sensor will automatically collect data in the background as the developer works on his/her projects in Visual Studio. Data is sent to the server regularly if wireless connection is detected. Otherwise, data will be buffered locally until the data can be sent to the server.  </p>

<p>Featured documentation are listed below. For information regarding acquisitions, milestones, resources, risks, and use cases please see our wiki pages.  </p>

 summary : <p>Quick Update: iHacky 1.0 Released!This is the project homepage for the iHacky facebook application.IntroductionThe objective of this project is to create a social networking application for software developers through the popular social network site &quot;Facebook.&quot; In order for the project to be successful, the project must satisfy the 3 prime directives. Details on the how the system works can be found in the developer guide.  A brief description of the main feature is it will gather data from the Hackystat system, store and share the data to create a social network.  Proposed features of the system are listed here: </p>

<p>Prime Directive #1: Provide useful features  </p>

<p>Personal and community discussions on software engineering </p>

<p>Statistics on programming languages and tools Ranking system that determines a user&#39;s software engineering prowess based on Hackystat data and their contributions to the iHacky community iHacky profile that includes user&#39;s developer webpage and blog, rank, and personal statistics Searchable data about problems and issues.   </p>

<p>Automatically notify other users that a iHacky user needs help. </p>

<p>Able to display project information users are developing. Able to search other users based on their skills and expertise Prime Directive #2: External users can successfully install the systemThe current state of the application allows any user to install the application on their facebook.  The application has not yet been fully published, meaning that Facebook users cannot search for the iHacky application in the Facebook application search function. Users can install the application by clicking here. </p>

<p>Prime Directive #3: External developers can further develop the systemThis project will be an open source project. iHacky will be developed entirely on open source technologies such as PHP and MySQL.  The advantages of using open source technologies is that any developer can develop iHacky without concern about cost.  We will gladly accept developers who are interested in contributing to this project. Developers can download the iHacky source code at our downloads section. Developers can also learn how to set up their own iHacky application from the Developers Guide. We also appreciate any feedback, recommendations, or ideas for this project.   </p>

<p>Current SystemThe current iHacky system gathers data primarily from 2 different sensordata types from the Hackystat framework.  iHacky gathers &quot;DevEvent&quot; and &quot;Coupling&quot; data from each iHacky member.  The &quot;DevEvent&quot; data describes the user&#39;s development actions.  These &quot;DevEvent&quot; data are creating when the user edits or saves a file.  The &quot;Coupling&quot; data is created when the user invokes apache Ant with the dependencyFinder.build.xml file.  This file uses the DependencyFinder tool to record the Java packages that the user utilizes. The iHacky application process these 2 sensor data by counting the number of times the user created &quot;DevEvent&quot; data with a certain file and compare it with the &quot;Coupling&quot; data with the same file.  With this comparison, we can generally estimate the proficiency of the user&#39;s knowledge with a certain package.  The iHacky application records all these data into the iHacky database. More information on what information is stored can be found in our developers guide.   </p>

<p>The iHacky system will allow the user to search through all of the Java packages and find other iHacky members associated with those packages.  The iHacky application has a built in email messaging system that allows the user to communicate with other members. The iHacky application also has a expertise browser to allow the user to browse through all the current Java packages that iHacky contains in its database.  The following screen shots are from the current iHacky system.   </p>

 title : The informative-workspace Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is an Informative Workspace?An informative workspace is a workspace with feedback mechanisms designed to help those who are working in it. </p>

<p>How is this project going to implement the informative workspace?Informative Workspaces tend to blend the physical and virtual: &quot;manually updated non-electronic visual displays&quot; co-exist with &quot;electronic devices hooked up to automated processes&quot;. The result (as Kent Beck puts it), is &quot;when an interested observer walks into your team space, s/he should be able to get a general idea of how your project is going in 15 seconds, and be able to get a deeper perspective on real or potential problems by looking more closely.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This project is focused on adding an automated, electronic display to the growing arsenal of informative workspace tools.  The first version of this project will be built for this 3x3 monitor grid.  Software developers who want to track their projects&#39; progress with software such as Hackystat, Hudson CI, structure 101, and intra-dev-team communications through Google discussion pages, IMs, and twitter will be able to use this system to bring all of that data together in one dynamic &quot;billboard&quot; updated in real time.  The billboard will summarize the current state of things so that when a member of a development team steps in the room, they will immediately get a big-picture sense of where they are in the project. </p>

<p>A workspace can often consist of multiple teams involved in different &quot;sub-projects&quot;.  One office can create a single account in this IW billboard and create multiple profiles in that account for each team that uses the same office space.  Each profile will have a different unique set of data and the account master profile will gather data from all the profiles for parallel comparison and integrated analysis. </p>

<p>Teams and managers can pick which data is most important for them at any given stage in the development.  A balance needs to be struck between giving the user sufficient control, and keeping the system automated and &quot;hands-off&quot; so as not to distract from the important work being done in the workspace. </p>

<p>The project currently consists of a ProjectOverviewer, which acts as the heart of a given (sub)project.  It takes up one screen and shows various HackyStat statistics through a HeatMap about the project its files. </p>

<p>Initial investigation into a CountdownClock, a ChatRoom integration, the CyVis complexity analysis, and HackystatTelemetry has also been done.  See the RoadMap and respective wikipages for more details.</p>
 title : The iphone-haptics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Update: HapticKB does not intermittently crash on the latest iPhone firmware 1.1.4. Apple kindly fixed the problem. </p>

<p>iphone-haptics </p>

<p>Iphone-haptics is a project run by the Computing Science Department of the University of Glasgow, Scotland. Our aim with this web site is to publicly experiment with user interface design prototypes, implemented on the Apple iPhone utilising its built-in variable intensity actuator and multi-touch screen.    </p>

<p>Why Haptics?Current mobile device user interface elements are based on desktop widgets not originally intended for small screen finger-based interfaces. Given the dynamic nature of mobile environments, many interaction scenarios can arise and mobile UIs should be designed to accommodate these.  </p>

<p>The term haptic, in general, refers to the sense of touch. Mobile devices can provide users with haptic feedback. Using recent devices, this feedback can be presented via a touchscreen by applying forces, vibrations or motion to the user’s fingertip. Our various different haptic UI concepts and widgets revolve around interaction afforded by fingertip controlled interfaces with an aim to revolutionise mobile device interaction design and escape traditional desktop designs haunting our mobiles today.  </p>

<p>The majority of interaction on a mobile device is visual thus placing a huge demand on the users visual attention which can be dangerous in certain mobile situations or socially inappropriate in meetings for example. Furthermore, when interacting with a button - for example, with the fingertip - the image of the button is covered by the fingertip and therefore any visual feedback can go unnoticed.  </p>

<p>By using haptic feedback, users can physically ‘feel’ their interface and any feedback provided thus reducing the visual demand and allowing for more socially appropriate and subtle interaction. </p>

<p>Prototype 1: Haptic Keyboard </p>

<p>Although the keyboards used on touchscreen devices are based on the original physical mobile keyboards, one important feature is lost: the buttons cannot provide the tactile response that physical buttons do when touched or clicked. Without the tactile feedback, users can only rely on audio and visual cues which can be ineffective in mobile applications.  </p>

<p>One of the key features lost in touchscreen interaction is the ability to feel the buttons. For instance, although touchscreen keyboards are based on physical keyboard designs, they do not produce the natural haptic response which occurs when a button is touched. There have been recent studies into the use of mobile touchscreen devices and the incorporation of virtual tactile feedback with fingertip interaction (1). It has been shown that tactile feedback can be added to button presses using standard mobile phone vibrotactile actuators and can be beneficial to mobile device users, increasing typing speeds and reducing errors. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ClickHaptic feedback has been added to the finger down and up events triggered when a keyboard button is clicked. These events have been adapted to create a fingertip-over event which is fired when the finger moves over any button in the interface. When the fingertip-over event is triggered, a 1-beat smooth 70ms high intensity Tacton (2) is presented using the iPhone’s built-in rotational motor. The cue uses an approx. 175Hz sine wave with increasing intensity during the ramp up time and decreasing intensity during the ramp down time to create a smooth rounded feeling button.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The iPhone&#39;s built-in vibrotactile actuator is shown in the top left hand corner of the above picture. This is turned on when the keyboard buttons are pressed. We have found that the actuator can vibrate at 12 different speeds offering a wide range of tactile sensations.  </p>

<p>When the button is released by the finger, a second 1-beat Tacton is presented to confirm that the button has been pressed successfully. This feedback is 50ms with a lower amplitude setting of 6 thus producing a shorter lower intensity haptic click. By adding haptic feedback to both the finger down and finger up events during button clicks, the natural snap ratio of a physical button is reproduced virtually. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fingertip-Over-Edge EventAnother key feature lost in a touchscreen keyboard is the ability to feel the edges of the keys. We have created a tactile equivalent to this so that users can feel around the display and know when they were on a key or moving between one key and the next. </p>

<p>An event is triggered whenever the fingertip moved over the edge of any button on the screen, indicating a transition or slip from one to the next (fingertip slips can be troublesome for users and can cause errors that are often undetected). This allows users to run their fingertips over the buttons feeling all of the edges.  </p>

<p>Prototype 2: T-Bars and File-o-Feel </p>

<p>Mobile device user interface elements tend to be based on desktop widgets that were not originally intended for small screen finger-based interfaces. Mobile scenarios afford different interactions from desktop scenarios, so should be designed accordingly. This prototype demonstrates a new type of widget, the T-Bar (tactile bar), designed specifically for finger-based touchscreen interfaces using tactile feedback. Through the addition of tactile feedback, the user’s fingertip is guided along the T-Bar until an item is successfully selected. </p>

<p>T-Bar Interface WidgetT-Bars 3 are user interface widgets that take on the role of buttons, named as such because they are both tactile and have a vibro-map shaped like the letter T, shown in a horizontal layout in the image below. Tactile feedback is most  useful when used to enhance gestural interactions, we have designed an element where the fingertip is used to slide and activate, using tactile feedback to guide the user to a successful activation and make adjusting movements along the way. The slide movement is analysed and, if the length of the slide is above the threshold and the fingertip touches the top of the T-Bar, an activation event is triggered. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>File-o-FeelFile-o-Feel 3 is a prototype T-Bar list interface based on the traditional file-o-fax/rolodex concept of a scrollable tab-divided collection of information. Most mobile UIs present catalogues of information in large scrollable lists; if there is a large amount of content to be displayed in the list, each index heading can be extremely small and difficult to select with the fingertip. Furthermore, the finger may often occlude the index text, making rapid lookup difficult or impossible. This type of interface was chosen for our prototype because it is typical of many mobile applications containing lists of items; for example, lists of songs in music players, emails in mail applications and contacts in address books. File-o-Feel (pictured below) is designed to utilise a vertical row of T-Bars. The horizontal edges of a vertical list of items can be felt, and by sliding along the edge the item may be opened to fill the display. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Left hand side shows File-o-Feel interface with T-Bar rows and left-to-right gesture. Right hand side shows two-  finger gesture required to scroll through the list. </p>

<p>As T-Bars have been designed for touch interfaces and these increasingly support multi-touch functionality, the File-o-Feel interface also exploits multi-touch capabilities, allowing users to simultaneously use multiple fingers, rather than just one. File-o-Feel operates in two different modes, selection mode and scrolling mode. Scrolling mode is activated when the user places two fingers on the screen. File-o-Feel allows users to quickly scroll through the list of information using two fingers, whilst ‘feeling’ and interacting with the T-Bars can be accomplished with one finger in selection mode. This technique eliminates the need for traditional scrollbars, whilst continuing to support the traditional requirement for lists longer than the height of the screen, and also preventing problems that can occur with touchscreen lists when users intends to scroll but their touch triggers a selection event instead. In File-o-Feel the user can touch anywhere on the list whilst using two fingers without selecting anything, because ‘feel’ or selection mode is disabled. Then, using one finger, users can slide along the T-Bar of the item they wish to select. Here they will feel another tactile bump to indicate that the item has been selected successfully. Whilst traditional UIs have the concept of focus we deliberately ignore it. For example, if a button is pressed in a traditional interface only that button can receive movement events until the press is released once more. The concept of focus is not used in our interface so that users may start by selecting one item via its T-Bar and then move their finger to another T-Bar, without lifting it off the display. </p>

<p>File-o-Feel will soon be available for you to try. </p>

<p>Future iPhone Haptic ElementsWe are continuing to develop new haptic interaction concepts for use with the iphone which enhance interaction with lists and a completely new interaction technique solely for fingertip interfaces. Stay tuned. </p>

<p>DisclaimerOur applications use undocumented methods and as a result can be unstable, we have not damaged any iPhones ourselves but please be careful and use our software at your own risk. If the vibrations get &quot;stuck&quot; on, then run the application again and, on the next tap, they will stop. The long-term effects of continually using the vibration actuator in this way are not yet known, for example, battery life or vibrator failure. These should be investigated before making long-term use of this software.</p>

<p>  This project is new and still in development. Right now I am working on documenting the software and the methods to detect software design patterns that were introduced in this work. Please let me know if you have questions.  </p>

<p>Setup InfoIn case you have problems running the examples, please check your environment 
<br/>configuration. The following page describes the setup that we are using. 
<br/>http://www.cse.yorku.ca/course_archive/2006-07/F/6431/tools.htmlInfoDesign patterns abstract reusable object-oriented software design. Each pattern solves design problems that occur in every day software development. The detection of design patterns during the process of software reverse engineering can provide a better understanding of the software system. The latest tools rely on the abstract syntax tree representation of the source code for fact extraction.  Our approach uses static and dynamic code analysis to detect design pattern in Java applications. We use the roles, responsibilities and collaboration information of each design pattern to define static and dynamic definitions. The static definitions are used to find candidate instances during the static analysis. After the static analysis we validate the found candidate instances using the dynamic behavior of design patterns. For the dynamic analysis we instrument the Java bytecode of the application we are analyzing with additional code fragments and extract method traces from the running application. These method traces represent the dynamic facts of an application. We present several restrictions that are used to define design patterns dynamically. After the dynamic validation we rank the results according on how good they match the dynamic definitions. This thesis introduces a new approach in detection of object-oriented design patterns in Java applications. We test our approach using the 23 original GoF design patterns and analyze the results. Compared to other tools, our software achieves better results in detecting design patterns. The methods we choose for our approach work great in detecting patterns given the static and dynamic facts as input files.</p>

 summary : <p>Pbdms is a peer-to-peer sharing window application, which is aimed to support researchers, readers to manage their documents (e.g: Papers, Ebooks, PhD Thesis..) as well as share these documents with their comments, rating to other users in the network. </p>

<p>When multiple users running the program (on their own computer) and connect to each other (by adding IP of buddies&#39; computers), they form a network. In this network, people can share their documents and comments about them. At the same time, users are able to search for documents to see other&#39;s comments and download these documents. It is very convenient for users when they want to read a document but they don&#39;t know how useful it is, they first search for others&#39; comments then decide whether to read it or not. </p>

<p>This program is very suitable and useful for a university where a lot of researchers, students reading hundreds of documents a day... It will save alot of time reading these documents. </p>

<p>The program is developed using DotNet Technology, C# language and XML as the database. It is open source and free to distribute.</p>

 summary : <p>Membrane Computing is an emergent branch of Natural Computing introduced by G. Paun. This new model of computation starts from the assumption that the processes taking place in the compartmental structure of a living cell can be interpreted as computations. The devices of this model are called P systems. Roughly speaking, a P system consists of a cell-like membrane structure, in the compartments of which one places multisets of objects which evolve according to given rules. </p>

<p>Most variants of membrane systems have been proved to be computationally complete, that is equivalent in power to Turing machines, and computationally efficient, that is able to solve computationally hard problems in polynomial time. Although most research in P systems concentrates on computational powers, lately they have been used to model biological phenomena. </p>

<p>As P systems are inspired from the structure and functioning of the living cell, it is natural to consider them as modelling tools for biological systems, within the framework of Systems Biology, being an alternative and complementary to more classical approaches like Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and to some recent approaches like Petri nets and π-calculus. </p>

<p>P system models take into consideration the discrete character of the quantity of components and the inherently randomness in biological phenomena. Besides, the key feature of P systems is the so called membrane structure which represents the heterogeneity of the structural organisation of the cells, and where one can take into account the role played by membranes in the functioning of the system. </p>

<p>In this repository we will collect the partial achievements in the development of our software project for applications in P systems.</p>

 summary : <p>A pure python client library for putting and getting jobs from the beanstalkd queue. </p>

<p>More info about beanstalk can be found at the project&#39;s homepage </p>

<p>Feedback: Please let us know if you find any problems, or have any suggestions for improvement.  Also, there are the beginnings of a twisted client in trunk right now. Give it a try! </p>

<p>Latest: 0.11.0 -- this version of the beanstalk client will work with beanstalkd 0.10 and 0.11.  beanstalkd is currently in a rc cycle for 1.0, which means that this client will work for most releases through 1.0. </p>

<p>Older versions are available on the download page. </p>

<p>Important Note: pybeanstalk is written to python 2.5  It takes advantage of some features that are new in that python version (specifically: the functools module, and generators that have the notion of .send()).  I am willing to help port this to older python versions, but am not going to do so unless someone will actually use that functionality. Feel free to contact me about such a change. </p>

<p>The other way is there is a class this module exposes called SnarlMessage. This allows you to keep track of the message as a python object.  If you use the send without specifying False as the argument it will set the ID to what the return of the last SendMessage was.  This is of course only  useful for the SHOW message. </p>

<p>qMock is a &#39;expect-run-verify&#39; JavaScript mocking library in the style of jMock, or EasyMock, which can be used in isolation, or more usefully in conjunction with a test-harness such as QUnit, or YUI Test as part of the TDD cycle. It facilitates behaviour-based, or &#39;glass-box&#39; testing of JavaScript programs, by allowing developers to mock collaborator objects, and verify their behaviour. It was written by Mark Meyer and Andy Beeching, a couple of JS hackers in London, and we thought we&#39;d share the results with the community. </p>

To fully understand this project&#39;s agenda, it is necessary to understand that the fundamental reason for democratically available property rights is NOT about greed or money.  Providing the secure property data infrastructure is about enabling others to own property, to build their enterprises, to create products and services that others can enjoy and appreciate and to pursue happiness according to their OWN AGENDA. </p>

<p>Institute for Liberty and DemocracyProperty rights have an extremely profound impact upon health and sustainability of  human liberty and democracy.  If robust property rights mechanisms and efficient free enterprise transactions are available, individuals can derive their own meaning and sustenance by working on those ventures and creating products that both provide income and define their own existence.  Information technology is key in documenting property ownership as well as ensuring symmetric information in negotiations and exchanges. </p>

 summary : <p>Thursday July 23, 2009 7:54 - 8:02 pm - Who&#39;s brining the wine for 2009!!! Skylines...pie lines...Obama is here Obama is here and those sky little...women are about to lose two in a row and drop out of the playoff race right before allstar break.  </p>

<p>All set up for power move though, whatever they want in LA for CP, then whatever they want for Sudney, Catherine, Janel in NY!!! Like cool and easy/Hot and Nasty USA Gymnastics...and then she came in to crush the competition in dancing with the stars...what a surprise!!! AVP stars making successful transition soon to Oak Street Beach/Michigan Avenue with every one looking forward to 2010 and 2012 cause not enough World Records this Olympic Summer Games. Even though Beijing, China allowed American girls and women to have a unique and exciting chance to attain the level of elite world class athlete, this is especially true in soccer as in the first season of WPS Women&#39;s Professional Soccer see&#39;s Chicago Red Stars sixth place of seven teams... </p>

<p>What is the responsibility of coaching, academia, and the women’s movement to the attainment of such athletic accomplishments in our community? As a baccalaureate and M.A. Chicago Studies Loyola University Chicago alumni and third semester M.S. Information Technology Computer Science student in Technology Management (TM) Track continuing archival and traditional research attempts to analyze this question through the development of this open source project centered around athletics management software. </p>

<p>Methods – Development of business plan/coaching style/open source project built around IT/archival data coincides to March 2008 visits to Notre Dame Archives and other visits to the Chicago State, De Paul, Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern, and UIC archival collections, De Paul has up until this point been the source most referenced. Although now realizing that the University of Detroit Mercy (like Loyola University Chicago, also a member of the Horizon League conference) and Marquette archival collections are also accessible, this revision centers on a reexamination of the (UIC) University of Illinois at Chicago archives and recent discovery of Notre Dame collection. </p>

<p>Results – Business plan/open source project/archival paper/coaching credentials in early stages of development but there seems to be substantial lack of coaching focus on specific goals of world class athletics in midwest which can be directly seen in lack of Olympic presence of girls and women in this area and lack of athletic record almost totally in archival collections concerning girls and women. Most strikingly, at the De Paul archives, the collection with the most current archival materials, it was obvious that the two programs many would consider closest to world-class elite women’s athletics are both chronicled, however slightly, yet other sports are starkly absent.  Secondly, at Northwestern, the archival record is, at times, parallel with the history (if not the Illinois history) of the development of women’s athletics specific to world-class competition, such as the Olympics. Lastly, at other universities - Chicago State, UIC, and Loyola, the overall lack of archival data is alarming, thus the reason for the reexamination.  </p>

<p>Conclusions -  This research into women’s athletic development has led to a thesis that girl’s/women’s athletes in American universities are not usually competitive with world-class standards, and this directly correlates with traditional defeatist/gradualist attitudes embraced by a majority of the coaches of American, and especially, midwest and more specifically Chicago-area girls and women.</p>

 title : The terot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Having a full test suite with good coverage for your large application is an essential tool for maintaining code reliability and programmer sanity, but despite this, many projects still neglect this important aspect of software development.  In pondering this programming paradox, I came to understand two fundamental axioms of software development: </p>

<p>1.  Software developers are pompous *******s who truly believe their code is simply too elegant and efficient to necessitate testing, despite half a century of testament to the contrary and a bulging bug list. </p>

<p>2.  Writing unit tests is simply not much fun.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, no software tool will ever be capable of bending the average software developer&#39;s ridiculously inflated ego, but a tool that can provide a comprehensive test suite without requiring the writing of a single test ... well, at least it&#39;s a Turing-computable problem. </p>

<p>Terot began life as a project to teach myself the intricacies of Java generics &amp; reflection, but somehow grew into a project that taught me generics and reflection, AND was available for free on Google Code.  The basic premise is that by injecting essentially random data into your methods and recording the results, you can identify behavioral changes in your application&#39;s logic and predict future problems before they occur.  To this end, The Goal of the project is to develop a tool that provides the most generally useful test analysis as possible, while requiring a hard limit of half an hour to set up on a project of arbitrary size.</p>
 title : The trackingtestmetricssimplified Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Metrics are very important in the development of software as it helps to identify the errors in the software development and thus helps to ensure the quality of the software. Testing metrics or test metrics helps to improve the testing process by providing information such as real status, quality and productivity of the testing effort. This helps to ensure that the tested software is defect free. </p>

<p>The most difficult part of a testing process is in tracking these test metrics. This is an arduous task as details of the test cases created or executed, defects filed or changed, resources added or removed need to be constantly updated. This puts a lot of pressure on the QA test management team as they need to spend a lot of time in tracking these. Thats where an advanced test management system comes handy. </p>

<p>These systems facilitate live tracking, thus updating the metrics instantaneously and accurately. And also since the testing details are updated in neat charts and tables information like track creation, execution and defects by release, priority or user can be tracked very easily; just click and see the updates.</p>

 title : The unityasap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>We here at UnityASAP, believe that unity is the goal of the modern church.  Two thousand years ago an example was set by the first church of how to uplift and support one another. </p>

<p>Time is precious.  Love is the most important commandment.  We seek to unify the power of the Church in love, by giving them the opportunity to give their most precious of commodities, time, in service to both God, and the fellow man.  We believe that by giving we enable God to bless our lives. </p>

<p>The software under development here will be free to all, and will maintain this vision of using technology to further the unity of the body of Christ. </p>

<p>Our first project, is a prayer network. </p>

<p>This application will be Client Server, with the primary server software being based on Python, and the primary client being a Web Client. </p>

<p>We would like to make the server side software a network similar to Napster in that there are central index servers, and organizations can run this software as a web server.  The software would then register itself to the Global Index servers, which would maintain a list of lists. </p>

<p>Prayer requests would be entered into the server and locally filtered or handled by the organization, and then input onto the network, where it would be filtered, and cleaned up by volunteers, and then propagated throughout the world wide network.  Prayer Warriors would receive a set number of prayer requests daily and would choose to pray for or ignore the request. </p>

<p>If they decide to ignore the request then it would be sent to a different warrior. </p>

<p>At some point we will decide how many Prayer Warriors are appropriate for the type of response needed based on the severity and impact of the prayer request. </p>

<p>A system of 7 priority levels on prayer requests is being developed, from the lowest priority request, discernment over an issue to the highest level 7 request, which would be such things as Global Warming, or Presidential Politics. </p>

<p>Higher priority requests would be sent to larger numbers of Prayer Warriors.  The general population would only be able to enter prayer requests up to a certain level, the higher level requests would be reserved as a network emergency bulletin to get immediate action from as many Prayer Warriors as possible.  For example say a disaster the likes of 9/11 were to happen, we would then push out a level 7 prayer request to the entire network to pray for the families, and to lift up the rescuers that were risking their lives. </p>

<p>The lower level requests would have instant feedback as Prayer Warriors signed on to pray for the request.  For example, you have 145 Prayer Warriors engaged in spiritual battle for your request.  As the Warriors join the battle, the number would go up.  For this reason we want to have a mobile client for the iPhone that would allow more active interaction with the software while away from the computer.</p>

 summary : <p>Lightweight C++ framework for building network applications. Allows event-driven design, based on the Leader/Followers Reactor pattern as the most effective for UNIX-based systems. The idea behind the framework is simplicity, scalability, very high performance and low dependency from other software. To be a “swiss knife” for network applications. It consists of four parts building the modular framework functionality. The first one is abstraction of the socket-based communication mechanisms. It easily fits into the reactor part, that abstracts the OS-level multiple event sources multiplexing mechanisms. The third part contains most of the needed utilities for every network application like string processing, abstraction of POSIX threads and thread-synchronization mechanisms. Fourth one is for logging and tracing. The framework also comes with small, modular, easy-to-read, scalable HTTP server, that demonstrates how the framework parts fit into a real-world application. The framework is built on top of the standard C++ library and pthread library as the intent is minimum dependency from other software.</p>

 summary : <p>BTLSocket is a framework for networking based on the BSD socket API (Winsock on Windows) which simplifies the process of creating, reading from, and writing to sockets. The framework offers the usual abstraction of event-based programming, but also allows for manual control of individual sockets. </p>

<p>The framework supports TCP and UDP over IPv4 and IPv6. </p>

<p>The framework allows programmers to string together classes which process input and output to and from the socket, each of these classes passing their results to the next class in line. In this way, it is possible to, for example, asynchronously read from a socket until a certain character sequence is found, and then pass the data read from the socket, or some part of it, to the main program flow. </p>

<p>This mechanism also eases the development of protocols, and allows, for example, the creation of a reusable class which implements SSL or TLS. </p>

<p>In fact, this project aims to also provide a few frameworks consisting of these kinds of classes, including an SSL/TLS framework based on OpenSSL. </p>

 summary : <p>The Clay Framework is a light-weight PHP framework geared toward performance, scalability, and extensibility. Clay&#39;s core currently consists of under 300 lines of code and uses an extendable library-class structure. Clay also allows the use of API modules, which are loaded dynamically and only when needed. API modules provide an interface for reusable functions that are in development or are not substantial enough to be used as a library. The small code base and dependency handling of Clay allows a small footprint and more powerful applications. </p>

<p>Clay&#39;s design allows an application developer to toss aside what isn&#39;t needed, or extend what is already there. It also features a powerful templating engine, which combines the flexibility of most compiled engines with the ease of pure PHP templating. </p>

 summary : <p>The Dash Framework enables Java components to be developed with clear and documentable external dependencies on configuration, component wiring, and runtime context. </p>

<p>Dash ObtainDashObtain: Provides lazy, thread-safe acquisition of fields with the @Obtain annotation. Like dependency injection, but more declarative. </p>

<p>Example @Obtain use (without error handling...): </p>

<p>public class Forwarder implements MessageListener {
<br/>  @Obtain MessageProducer forwardTo;</p>

<p>  public void onMessage(Message message) {
<br/>    forwardTo.send(message);
<br/>  }
<br/>}Dash ContextDashContext: Provides &#39;safe&#39; global variables: a public static @Context field can be exposed in a thread-safe, thread-local, and execution scoped manner. </p>

<p>An example is authenticated User. Contextual and execution scoped access to the current principal user is easy to show: </p>

<p>public class Authentication {
<br/>  @Context static Principal principal;
<br/>}</p>

<p>public class Forwarder implements MessageListener {
<br/>  ...</p>

<p>  public void onMessage(Message message) {
<br/>    Processor userDefault = getProcessorFor(Authentication.principal);
<br/>    ...
<br/>  }
<br/>}The reference to Authentication.principal will occur within the scoped execution of a message handler. Within that scope the principal can be setup and reliably removed like this: </p>

<p>public class PojoMessageDispatcher {</p>

<p>  @WithinContext
<br/>  public void dispatchMessage(Message message, MessageListener listener) {
<br/>    Authentication principal = lookupPrincipalFromChannel();
<br/>    listener.onMessage(message);
<br/>  }
<br/>}The @WithinContext will ensure that principal, once set, will be null-ed out after the dispatchMessage method returns. </p>

<p>Implementation TechnologyThese Dash projects are implemented with Java 5 and AspectJ. They support compile and load-time weaving.</p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to DRE Framework InitiativeThe search engines of World Wide Web have brought numerous people the ability to retrieve and browse internet information with ease. They have been very successful in meeting the expectations of general knowledge consumers looking for generic information on the internet. One of the key reasons for success of web search engines is their ability to identify structure among published internet documents, with the help of crawlers that exploit the hyperlinked nature of web. Enterprise knowledge consumers have much more complex requirements than simple literal searches. Accelerated rates of information explosion or its expiration coupled with unstructured nature of enterprise content have forced users to explore new avenues for effective search and information retrieval inside an enterprise setting. Unlike a generic user on the internet, an enterprise consumer often has more information on what he is looking for, in the form of documents, images or information artifacts. Establishing relationships between a given artifact and the content already available on an enterprise has become a very challenging task. </p>

<p>In this effort we plan to build a modular distributed research engine framework that helps users to query information by providing a sample artifact over a wide variety of enterprise and public data sources containing structured as well as unstructured content. Quiet often the enterprise consumers want to choose between the data sources over which the search is being performed rather than looking through the every information source inside the enterprise; where each information source can be structured or unstructured. Users should be able to relate the contents of a document artifact to the existing content in enterprise by dynamically querying several configured data sources and presenting them to the user in an appealing fashion.</p>

 summary : <p>Formy - CSS Form FrameworkFormy is CSS Framework for better form  management. </p>

<p>There are some great tools and examples for creating web forms. They usually use tables, div, list or just pure CSS for construction of the form layout. Some of these techniques are not so accessible (tables) or in absence of CCS the form layout will fall apart. </p>

<p>That is why I decided to make universal CSS for forms who will interact in the simple natural way with HTML form and HTML form will work decently well even without CSS. </p>

 summary : <p>Hartija - Css Print FrameworkRecently I had a client who wanted to improve the printing layout for his web site. I made mini case analysing various web printing techniques and how different web sites site manage &quot;printer friendly&quot; pages. </p>

<p>The Study and analysis of different CSS methods for web printing brought me to a discovery that many important web sites are not optimized for printing, even the kind that can be done with little effort. </p>

<p>To solve this problem I decided to make universal Cascading Style Sheets for web printing by uniting all best CSS printing practises into one. </p>

<p>What is CSS Framework? </p>

<p>&quot;A CSS framework is a library that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of a webpage using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Just like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks package a number of ready-made options for designing and outlaying a webpage.&quot; - Wikipedia </p>

<p>How to use this Framework? </p>

<p>Just use it like normal CSS: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Important: media set to &quot;print&quot; </p>

<p>When you print the browser will use the stylesheet defined for printing. </p>

Other features are also provided for application security, internationalization, data conversion, and SQL operations. </p>

<p>News (Dec 2007)The first Websites based on InMotion Framework is now live at http://www.jeepskiing.com/ !Most of the InMotion Framework components and code are based on the code generated by CodeCharge Studio and donated to the project by YesSoftware, Inc.  YesSoftware is also a sponsor of this project. </p>

<p>Some of the benefits of using InMotion Framework include: </p>

<p>Free ASP.NET component library. InMotion components will include medium-advanced components such as Grid, Record, Editable Grid, Gallery, Calendar, Report. Less amount of coding. Provided components offer many properties for configuring advanced functionality. Simplicity of coding. We will offer sample applications that demonstrate how to implemenet advanced features in Web applications with very simple code. Support for 3rd party tools like CodeCharge Studio for even faster RAD. Active development and support with frequent updates and patches. </p>

<p>The InMotion Framework will be distributed in 2 forms: </p>

<p>Visual Studio project containing the framework code in C#, and documentation Executable updates for CodeCharge Studio that enable CodeCharge Studio to create VB.NET and C# Web applications based on the InMotion Framework. </p>

<p>The InMotion Framework is distributed under dual licensing: </p>

<p>GPL license allows for the InMotion Framework to be included in all open source applications based on the same GPL license. A commercial license is offered at no charge (free) for inclusion in any Web applications created with either Visual Studio or CodeCharge Studio. This means that only companies who want to use InMotion Framework with other software tools should contact us to obtain our permission to do so. </p>

<p>There are two separate modules: </p>

<p>Legato Actions - extension of well known command pattern to make tasks and actions. Legato Injection - Depedency Injection Container based on MXML configuration and metadata injection </p>

<p>Legato ActionsActions framework solves some common tasks and problems that exist during rich application development: </p>

<p>multiple access methods to functionalities (by button, menu item, context menu etc.), building multilingual interfaces, building sequences of tasks (for example to show dialog and save document before closing it ), organizing business components. </p>

<p>An example and see the source. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Multilingual supportNames, icons, tooltips are loaded from resources file  </p>

<p>addAction.label=Add
<br/>addAction.tooltipText=Add task
<br/>addAction.icon=Embed(&#39;../../icons/add.png&#39;)Changing language on runtime changes actions and visual components language. </p>

<p>Actions aware visual componentsJust add your action to button, menu or context menu - visual components will take the look from action and execute it on click. </p>

<p>Read more on LegatoActions </p>

<p>Legato InjectionIt&#39;s an implementation of the pattern as described by Martin Fowler in “Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern”. It contains setter injection and constructor injection implementations. Main ideas are to : connect simple components in depedency injection container, make use of Flex features e.g. use MXML files (with code completition etc.) rather than external XML files for depedency injection configuration, </p>

<p>This container can be used also as a service locator. Features: </p>

 title : The openface-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Social network application is a new and significant phenomenon in 2008. There are now over 24,000 Facebook applications in 6/2008. In order to develop a Facebook application, a developer must be proficient in several languages including PHP (or Java) and JavaScript. In addition, the developer has to learn new technologies including FBML, FQL, Mock AJAX. There is an opportunity to significantly reduce the amount of effort involved in the initial learning and development as well as on-going maintenance of these applications. </p>

<p>In addition, Open Social is a strong alternative to the Facebook API but uses a different technology architecture. Developers are stretched trying to support two API in one application.  This is analogous to the multi-platform support challenges before the Web. There is no solution today to help ease this pain and, again, there is a significant opportunity to address and solve this problem.</p>

 summary : <p>Pal - PHP Application Library </p>

<p>Probably the world&#39;s quickest AND most flexible PHP application framework! How can that be? Well, here are some of the features. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>- It&#39;s a &quot;programmer&#39;s framework&quot;. It lets you dive in and write code for your site right away in a dynamic, expressive way, using just PHP. </p>

<p>- Separate your site cleanly into Actions, Views, Components, allowing several people to work on different tasks. </p>

<p>- Very easy to learn, e.g. functions are called Pal::action, Pal::view, Pal::import, and do exactly what they say. Be productive in almost no time at all. </p>

<p>- Very flexible system for importing other PHP code and reusing components in many projects, independent of directory structure. </p>

<p>- Extensible through an extremely flexible and powerful plugin system and hook system. Build your site out of reusable plugins. </p>

<p>- Functions to validate and sanitize parameters, among other things. </p>

<p>- Layouts that keep track of scripts, stylesheets, and more, automatically </p>

<p>- Really easy to use database system that writes code for you (currently supports MySQL additions like ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE) </p>

<p>- Very poewrful object relational mapping that allows foreign keys with arbitrary numbers of fields, arbitrary joins and relationships to be defined, in an object-oriented way. Easily retrieve related row, join them together if necessary, and process them through the ORM. </p>

<p>- Engineered for speed! Almost all files aren&#39;t loaded unless they are needed, so your projects can be huge. Pages typically can render with only a few milliseconds&#39; overhead. Even the ORM is fast :) </p>

<p>- Independence of features -- use some or all. </p>

<p>- Coming soon: CMS project for building projects that allow users to manage the site, like Drupal. (CMS project will import the users and permissions plugins.)</p>

 title : The phaux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Phaux is a PHP5 web application framework that abstracts much of HTTP and it&#39;s inherent weaknesses.  </p>

<p>A component based framework for creating applications. A Phaux component is a stateful object that is responsible for drawing itsself. Any component can embed or call any number of other components. This allows a high degree of reusability.  Callback based request handling. With Phaux you don&#39;t have to create a page to handle a link or a form. You simply provide a callback to be executed when the link is clicked or the form is submitted. The HTML generation is programmatic, no templates, allowing the developer to think of code and not layout. CSS has matured enough that it should be used for layout exclusively. This allows the programmer and designer to work largely independently.  REServe object relational mapper provides automatic database table creation and migration. REServe and Phaux work together to provided rapid prototyping of web applications with no code generation. The databases and the tables do not have to be hand crafted by the developer, as they are generated from your object and automatically migrate with your objects. Advanced error handling. While in development mode Phaux prints informative backtracked colorized error messages with source code so that your problems can be fixed quicker and will less headache. Phaux even catches internal PHP errors like parse errors and presents a custom error page. When your application is marked as deployed Phaux displays a generic error page with a unique error number. Never again will your application display an ugly cryptic error message to your end users.   Discussion group is at. http://groups.google.com/group/phaux-dev</p>

 title : The pluto-test-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PLUTOAs in-database languages become increasingly powerful, programmers are beginning to create more and more code that runs within database management systems.  Included in this mix is one of the most popular database management systems in use today, Oracle, along with its proprietary programming language, PL/SQL. </p>

<p>Though there many powerful tools for creating PL/SQL code, there are limited tools and frameworks for properly testing that code.  The PL/SQL Unit Testing for Oracle framework, PLUTO, is the open source, object oriented, xUnit-based system for developing unit tests that attempts to fill the gap in Oracle unit testing. </p>

<p>The framework is written in PL/SQL and is based on the Oracle object system.  The inner-workings of the system are based largely on the JUnit design, with a few PL/SQL&#39;isms added in.  The system is built to be easily extended and has hooks to interface with common test runners like Perl&#39;s Test::Harness. </p>

<p>PLUTO is lightweight, easy to install, and is free and open for everyone to use.  Please feel free to give it a spin and comment back with any feedback that you might have. </p>

 title : The pux Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewPUX allows you to create data processing networks, connecting various data processing nodes with each other. Possible applications (given suitable node implementations) include data mining, image analysis/pattern recognition, and much more. The main goal of this project is to create data processing components or applications with minimum effort and maximum flexibility. </p>

<p>DetailsNodes are re-useable micro-components, designed to perform a specific high-level task (such as reading a text file, loading an image, or calculating something). Within a network, these are connected via the nodes&#39; ports, which may perform implicit type checking and/or conversion of data. A node will sit idle, waiting for data to arrive on it&#39;s (required) input ports. Once all input ports are filled with data, the node executes and pushes the resulting data through it&#39;s output ports.  Configuration of a node takes place through configuration ports. A configuration port is essentially a required input port, but usually has constant data available by default. This could be the filename of an image to load, or proxy settings. However, a (compatible) output port may be connected to a configuration port as well, allowing for a node to be reconfigured at run-time. Each node runs in its own separate thread, pushing its output data to the connected target node(s) when there is data available for further processing. Generally, PUX is designed to allow the network topology itself to change during run-time. Although no network-altering nodes are available yet, the architecture is flexible enough to allow port re-connections, node additions or removals at &quot;any&quot; time during execution. Currently PUX only provides a small number of sample node implementations. These include HTTP network access, image loading and display (using a simple Swing frame), basic math operators, data split/merge nodes, XML loading and XPath selections. Other (more advanced) nodes are to follow soon. </p>

<p>XML Network ScriptsPUX comes with a script reader module, which creates PUX networks from XML documents at run-time. Possible applications are on-the-fly generation of PUX networks from various sources, execution of the network e.g. within a web or application server, and streaming the result back to the users. Exporting of XML scripts from existing network objects will be implemented in the near future. </p>

<p>OutlookEventually PUX is expected to grow into a full-fledged data processing framework, providing node implementations for as many use-cases as possible. Another goal is to develop a graphical network editor, allowing users to create and modify networks by using simple drag and drop operations.</p>

It takes the best ideas from it, which still allows for the user to completely separate program logic and presentation without unnecessary clutter. </p>

<p>This project really is the bare-bones, and it was created because I could find nothing else like it. A lot of the &quot;simple, easy&quot; frameworks I came across ended up having AJAX helpers, ADOdb connectors, Smarty templating, and other things that aren&#39;t completely necessary. This is all you need to get going, and nothing more. Anything else you&#39;d like to add in is totally up to you. </p>

<p>The only requirements are Apache, PHP, and mod_rewrite.</p>

 summary : <p>SOAFacesThe goal of the SOAFaces project is to provide developers with an API for building SOA and RIA powered components (called SOAFaces Bundles or just Bundles) that can be composed easily into web applications or workflows and jobs with convenient access to local and remote messaging services. </p>

<p>SOAFaces = RIA + SOA 
<br/>With SOAFaces you get the full power of an AJAX API combined with a SOA API. </p>

<p>What can I build with SOAFaces? </p>

<p>Secure Web Applications Mashup applications to full-blown AJAX clients Batch job scheduling Workflow processing You decide........ </p>

<p>SOAFaces download page. </p>

<p>Specifically, the goals of the SOAFaces project include the following: </p>

<p>No need to write GWT RPC code anymore. Use the UniversalClient API to talk with POJO services that are packaged in your application server and/or talk with Mule accessible services/endpoints all across your enterprise and internet. Your GWT application will have convenient access to messaging services (SOAP, JMS, ESB ...etc) that can return JavaBeans or JSON objects back to the GWT client. All marshaling is handled by the framework. A framework for building SOA GUI applications using modular/pluggable components. Build anything from a simple AJAX type weblet all the way to a full blown web application. Package your code as a component and deploy your code as a modular/pluggable and self contained component. SOAFaces components are packaged into a simple JAR formatted archive and easily shared, deployed, and run. Create back-end workflow powered jobs and services that can be scheduled and run on the back-end with easy access to web services. Workflow properties and configuration rules can be configured using a web GUI. There are three main constructs: </p>

<p>UniversalClient API - An API to use from any GWT client to make SOA service calls with no RPC. This API can be used with our without weblets/tasklets (you can use it in any plain old GWT client). Cool way to build GWT apps without all that RPC code and with easy access to web services. Weblet - A modular/pluggable way to build/package/deploy front-end web applications using GWT and SOA. Tasklet - A modular/pluggable way of build/package/deploy back-end tasks that can be run in scheduled batch jobs with convenient SOA integration. Sounds like a lot doesn&#39;t it? Well the SOAFaces framework is up to the task and keeps it as simple as possible. Keep reading if you would like to hear more........ </p>

<p>Building Web ApplicationsWith SOAFaces you can build and deploy web applications that are powered with SOA and GWT. You can build your web GUI using the GWT (Google Web Tookit) framework and deploy your GWT applications on any standard j2ee servlet engine (like Tomcat). With SOAFaces, web developers can focus on building applications that can easily tap into web services hosted across the network. SOAFaces provides a MuleClient like API called UniversalClient. For those not familiar, the MuleClient interface is a universal messaging client available from the Mule Project that can invoke services endpoints such as JMS, Web Services, SMTP, SFTP, ...etc and send and receive data. UniversalClient is an extension of the MuleClient API for AJAX/GWT applications with even more extended capabilities. UniversalClient gives a GWT client the ability to access ESB services exposed by Mule. You can also expose our own POJO services using UniversalClient and make them available from your servlet engine (WAR webapp) directly. So you can message with remote Mule services or develop your own services and access them all from the UniversalClient API. </p>

<p>To develop your own services, you create &quot;local&quot; services that you deploy in our servlet engine, and access these services using the same UniversalClient API. In fact the UniversalClient API functions as a universal messaging interface for GWT clients. It automatically marshals data in JSON and/or POJOs for you with no GWT RPC programming. The UniversalClient API builds on and extends the Mule endpoint notation, allowing you to access local POJO services within your web application (servlet engine). With this UniversalClient API you can mix and match resources and services all across the network to build GUI applications with a clear separation between the services/implementation and the GUI presentation. </p>

<p>Building Modular and Pluggable Client ApplicationsA Weblet is the essentially building block for building modular component based applications. It is simply a GWT client that adheres to the SOAFaces API for building a GUI component (called a Bundle) and provides for an easy way to deploy big or small GWT GUI applications into a container. A Weblet is a modular GWT client that you can pick up and deploy in any SOAFaces container. Using the power of GWT and SOA, you can build mashups that pull and combine data from different sources across your intranet or internet, allowing developers the freedom to focus on what they do best - building applications and not dealing with implementing server-side code and marshaling data between client and server. </p>

<p>Building Modular and Pluggable Workflows and JobsWorkflow? Yes, you can use SOAFaces to build jobs and tasks that can be run and scheduled in a workflow within a job processing container. The essential building block is called the Tasklet. Jobs (composed of one or more Tasklets) can be scheduled and run on a timer or executed on demand (this is up to the container to provide these services). A SOAFaces workflow can execute any arbitrary server-side java code and/or access messaging services via a MuleClient interface. The input properties of a workflow/job can optionally be edited, graphically, using the same GWT GUI framework used to build applications. So you are free to give your job/workflow components full-blown GUI interfaces to customize them anyway you chose. Or if you like just write server-side code (with no GUI) and package it up in a Bundle for use in a job. A Job can be composed of multiple Bundles. </p>

<p>Where/How to use the SOAFaces Framework?With SOAFaces you have several ways you can use the framework. You can use the framework for building modular Bundle jobs/tasks, modular Bundle GWT weblets, or as a SOA messaging API in your existing GWT clients code to extend your GWT client to the SOA universe. Here is a break down of the scenarios you have for using the SOAFaces API: </p>

<p>Usage Scenarios  Deploy Where?  Do What?  Tasklet API  Weblet API  IOViewer API  UniversalClient / Services API   Standalone GWT Client  Any standard J2EE container (e.g. tomcat, jetty...etc  As a messaging API for use in any GWT client to access SOA services     Required   GUI Component (Bundle)  SOAFaces Container (e.g. JobServer, SoaFacesRunner)  For deploying and running modular weblets/applications   Required   Optional   Workflow Component (Bundle)  SOAFaces Container (e.g. JobServer, SoaFacesRunner)  For batch job scheduling &amp; workflow processing  Required  Optional  Optional  Optional (with Weblet/IOViewer)  </p>

<p>Standalone GWT ClientThe SOAFaces framework can be used as part of your existing GWT web application and provide you the ability to connect your GWT application with POJO services in your backend webapp and to access Mule/SOA services all across your network. You can use the SOAFaces framework with any standard GWT application to access remote SOA services with no RPC coding. The UniversalClient is only one small part of the SOAFaces framework but it is a very powerful and useful API to use directly in your GWT web applications. The UniversalClient API provides any GWT client the ability to access Mule services/endpoints and to send/return JSON and POJO objects with minimal effort - no RPC! The API also allows creating &quot;local&quot; services that can be deployed within the Bundle server-side and accessed as POJOs services from the UniversalClient API. So you get simple POJOs exposed as local services with remote access provided using the UniversalClient API. </p>

<p>Simply include the SOAFaces framework JARs in with your servlet code and in your GWT code and you instantly have extended your GWT application with convenient messaging capabilities. No extra deployment or anything is needed. Simply use the SOAFaces framework with your existing GWT application and go. To get more information on how to get started using the UniversalClient API with you GWT application go here. </p>

<p>Bundles as Application ComponentsIf you want to build modular component application (weblet), then you can package your code as a Bundle and deploy it in a SOAFaces container that will run and manage your Bundle Application. A Bundle Weblet uses the the Weblet API to allow you to build GWT applications that are managed and run with a SOAFaces container. You of course have full access to the UniversalClient API as well, to access SOA services. </p>

<p>Bundles as Workflow ComponentsA Bundle Tasklet uses the Tasklet API to build modular server-side Java code that can be run as part of a larger job. The job can be scheduled for example and run any number of ways. The tasklet is packed in a Bundle and can also include a GUI customizer using the Weblet API. A Bundle Tasklet is deployed, run and managed, all within a SOAFaces container. </p>

<p>Underneath the HoodThe essential building blocks of SOAFaces are tasklets and weblets. A packaged SOAFaces component is called a SOAFaces Bundle (or Bundle). A Bundle can be made up of a weblet and/or tasklet. The tasklet provides the API for implementing and executing back-end java code and services when the Bundle is used to build a workflow job. The weblet provides the abstraction for building AJAX Web GUIs of any kind. A weblet can be a standalone web application, that interfaces with remote web services, or it can be the GUI used to customize the input properties of a tasklet. </p>

<p>As discussed, SOAFaces also provides easy access to Mule services and can easily interface and communicate with remote and local Mule services of all shapes and forms. SOAFaces leverages the GWT framework which serves the basis for its Web GUI API. </p>

<p>Weblet - Building ApplicationsThe Weblet is the main abstraction for building end user GUIs with SOAFaces. A weblet enabled application can be deployed and run from a web application server. A weblet based application can be deployed and loaded dynamically within a hosting container without requiring server restarts. The code that makes up a SOAFaces Bundle is bundled and packaged in a JAR called a Bundle (SoaFaces Bundle). Here are details on creating a SOAFaces Bundle (Bundle). </p>

<p>With a weblet, you have the full power of the GWT API at your disposal. The weblet interface itself is nothing more than a GWT Composite widget that can contain any GWT widget you drop into it. It functions as the top level UI panel for your application, mashup, or any other UI thing you want to build. What is especially nice about a weblet, is that you can just compile your GWT java classes into java binary classes and include them in a JAR file and the container will handle compiling your GWT java code into actual ajax/javascript. You can use virtually any standard GWT or third party GWT widget libraries and include them in your Bundle JAR and it will all get linked and compiled for you into ajax/javascript; this sort of similar to how a j2ee server complies JSP pages on the fly. Cool don&#39;t you think! So develop your components in GWT, package them up in a Bundle, and drop them into a SOAFaces container and go. No need to mess with GWT javascript to java compiling! </p>

<p>Weblets - Accessing Remote Server-Side ServicesWeblets and generic GWT applications can access services using the GWT UniversalClient interface. This API is similar to standard MuleClient API available in native server-side java. The GWT UniversalClient API can pass and return POJOs (basic java primitives and objects that support the GWT IsSerializable interface) and/or JSON types. So using the GWT UniversalClient interface a GWT weblet can access web services and other ESB endpoints throughout your enterprise and over the internet, and do this directly from a GWT GUI. </p>

<p>If we stopped there that would be interesting enough. However, you can also define your own &quot;local&quot; services and access such services directly from the GWT UniversalClient interface as well. A local services is a POJO method that is exposed as a local service and bundled directly within the Bundle JAR. So a Bundle can contain all the client and server/services code ,if that is what you prefer, or you can mix and match local services with remote service across your network or internet. </p>

<p>For example access a remote web services might go something like this: </p>

<p>  //pass POJO and returns POJO
<br/>  UniversalClient.send(&quot;axis:http://my-web-services.com/?method=hellworld&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, asyncPOJOHandler);All endpoints supported by Mule are supported the GWT UniversalClient interface. </p>

<p>Accessing a local services would look like this: </p>

<p>  //pass POJO and returns POJO
<br/>  UniversalClient.send(&quot;soafaces://com.acme.local.MyServices/getHelloWorldEndpoint&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, asyncPOJOHandler);</p>

<p>  //pass POJO and returns JSON
<br/>  UniversalClient.send(&quot;soafaces://com.acme.local.MyServices/getHelloWorldEndpoint&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, asyncJSONHandler);The prefix soafaces:// tells the UniversalClient to route the call to a POJO service in the current Bundle JAR and return the results of the method. In this example the method com.acme.local.MyServices.getHelloWrold(&quot;Bob&quot;) is called and a POJO or JSON result can be returned via the asyncHandler. </p>

<p>Tasklets - Building JobsA tasklet is a simple way to create any arbitrary server-side java code and run it a container that supports the SOAFaces Bundle API and run it as part of a job. The input and output of a tasklet is a JavaBean. One JavaBean for input and another for output. A tasklet consumes a JavaBean as input and returns a JavaBean as output. These input and output JavaBeans can have UI customizers/viewers that can edit and render the contents of the input/output JavaBeans for user manipluation. The Weblet API is used to render the GUI for the customizers/viewers. So you can pair a tasklet with a weblet if you want to give your tasklet a graphical representation (this is optional of course). </p>

<p>Multiple tasklets can be composed and packaged together into back-end workflows and executed on timers and schedules for example as part of a job. The specification defines a life cycle for the execution of one or more tasklets that are chained together to execute a single job.  </p>

<p>Tasklets - Property MappingTasklets even get more interesting and powerful when you understand how the property mapping features works between multiple tasklets that can makeup a job. Tasklets can share and communicate with each other when they run as part of a job/workflow. Individual tasklets can pass JavaBeans to each other during the execution of the workflow (a chain of tasklets). The output JavaBean of one tasklet can serve as the input to the next tasklet in the chain (or even other tasklet further down the chain). This is done through a mapping specification to allow the end user (business analyst type person or developer) the ability to configure which properties of one particular output JavaBean get mapped to which corresponding properties of another input JavaBean. This is a very powerful features, it allows end users to customize behavior using a simple point and click GUI where the output of one tasklet can function as input to another tasklet. It allows tasklet&#39;s with no knowledge of each other to work together to perform a larger and more complex job or workflow operation. The SOAFaces API makes all this possible and straight forwards. </p>

<p>Weblets and Tasklets - Use Them Together or SeparatelyAs mentioned, if you are only interested with building a RIA GUI, then you do not have to use the Tasklets API - you just focus on an use the Weblet API (org.soafaces.bundle.client package). Now, if you want to build back-end jobs and workflows then you should use the Tasklets API (org.soafaces.bundle.workflow package), and only use weblets, along with the tasklets, if you want to build GUIs to customize your tasklet&#39;s properties. Using weblets with tasklets is optional but is very powerful as it provides you with a way to allow end users to customize the inputs of tasklet. Once you have constructed your code, you then take it and package it up into a SOAFaces Bundle (Bundle JAR file) and deploy - that&#39;s it. It is very similar to deploying a WAR file but even simpler :) </p>

<p>OSGiSOAFaces Bundles sort of sound like OSGi bundles don&#39;t they? Well, the two have similar goals with regard to building modular components that can be deployed in a runtime container and discover each other....etc. SOAFaces takes it a little deeper, but the underlying requirements of packaging code into components and hot deployment, for example, are very much similar. The SOAFaces project will make every attempt to align itself with the OSGi effort where it makes sense. </p>

<p>Best, -Gordon Brander </p>

<p>AboutTaffy saves you time. As a CSS Developer, there are a few things you probably do a lot: override default browser styles, give your type a readable measure, re-work typography, etc. Taffy takes care of these tasks that you&#39;ve been doing over and over for every project, leaving you to do what you do best: craft semantic, beautiful CSS. </p>

<p>Taffy lends you a hand with...Resetting ugly default browser styles for cross-browser consistency and future-proofness. Giving type a consistent typographical measure. Readable, accessible em-based text. Typographical proportions based on the traditional scale 24, 18, 14, etc Giving older, senile browsers a pretty, usable basic stylesheet Making you a cup of tea (well, maybe in future).</p>

 title : The tester-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tester is simple integration testing framework. It enables you to execute functional regression tests. </p>

<p>Features </p>

<p>Simple usage. You do not need to know any programming language. Just create and edit files in folder. To execute test, simply issue tester with the name of the test as parameter. The name of the test is actually relative path to the folder where test files are placed. Tester has only CLI, no GUI. Portability. As Tester is written in java. it can be used on any java based platform (windows, unix) Abstraction. Execution of a test is driven by test script - test.flow file. The file defines sequence of test commands with parameters (a command correspondes to one line). Various commands were developed to work with FileSystem, JMS, Database, tibco Rv etc. This moves your testing work on higher level, you can focus more on fuctionality and business matters of the testing. Extensibility. You can develop your own commands to work with whatever system you want. The commands are implemented in java. Consistency.It supports token/value substitution and record multiplication for message files, reference files, sql scripts, and other test files. This allows you to extract functionality into the variables on one place, which keeps your test more consistent. 	 </p>

<p>Improved maintainance of your systems. It is possible to run a package of tests on background. When applied on daily basis, this allows you to keep the systems always fully functional and under control. With the simple daily report your manager could sleep better after an avalange of change requests has been implemented in systems.</p>

Infact i am starting a new project in image-recognistion&lt;&gt;AI... will put link in here soon.. --  I am back... If u are using this please do post some feedbacks ;).. will resolve bug reports as best as i can.. if i exhaust i shall give directions for self-help. </p>

<p>I realise that there has been so much download activity here...  for feedback(and further improvement)on this project please do email me.. here is my id &#39;joeljose420.at.gmail.com&#39; .. always in subject line use this word: &quot;bluecon&quot;. </p>

<p>BlueCon is a Generic Bluetooth Connectivity ServerIt offers j2me based mobile users/midlet_developers the freedom to connect to remote network(tcp/ip) services using Bluetooth. </p>

<p>The Uses....are many(depending on your creativity!!), here i list a few : 
<br/>Can be used to leverage the existing internet connection on a PC/LAPTOP to give internet access to mobile..ie, We can access all network services available in PC/LAPTOP 
<br/>Can be used to share remote device&#39;s services(resources) across multiple users over Bluetooth.(this can be used in effect for classroom teaching..where instructor can bring PC/LAPTOP and students can connect to classroom materials through their mobiles using bluetooth) 
<br/>Can be used to set up a smart home!!...or even an intrusion/problem response over mobile!!... ( use mobile to control LAPTOP/PC and interact with the intrusion sensor services ; say through ssh).  
<br/>Why yet another Bluetooth application, arent there tons already??There are many bluetooth based midlets that re-invent the wheel..and behave as if code-reuse was a scifi concept. With this project..i wish to give every midlet developer the freedom to come to terms with the fact that code reuse is not scifi as they have been forced to accept ..on the contrary, its as real as the air we breathe!! This is not an application project in itself.. its a midlet enhancing project, lets say a &quot;kind of library&quot;. </p>

<p>BlueCon ComponentsBasically made up of 2 parts : A BlueCon-Midlet-Extension that is applied to the midlet&#39;s original code ; and A BlueCon-server that is deployed on the remote device. </p>

<p>How do i use this &quot;library&quot; in my Midlet?Any existing J2me midlet can be made the BlueCon-Client by a very small modification to the original sources. There are no side-effects to this modification. Even casual users can do it -- after reading the HOWTO provided.(Midpssh, a popular j2me ssh client, will include the BlueCon extensions in its future releases) </p>

<p>RoadmapBluetooth based j2me mobiles are getting more economical with every passing day..soon it will become affordable for everyone. We can use BlueCon-Server to extend the boundaries of these mobile marvels... ;). </p>

<p>Having said these, I would be better off trying to &quot;cordinate&quot; my releases with some midlet developer, so that i can keep this project as helpful as it started. So In that respect i will be looking upto Midpssh- a really wonderful j2me ssh client. And personally i believe &quot;SSH&quot; is the single most application that can solve all needs ;). </p>

<p>Any midlet developer who needs my help in understanding or leveraging this project can contact me.. I will be very helpful ;) Do post your needs and doubts in the forum.</p>

<p>The Aim of this ProjectThis project has as it&#39;s aim to improve the availability of biblical materials for the purposes of promoting, biblical awareness, personal biblical study, cross cultural language learning and general Church use amongst disadvantaged people groups. This will be achieved by providing Missionaries and other supporting people/groups with a tool set which enables them quickly format and prepare print ready biblical materials for more efficient printing and distribution amongst these disadvantaged people groups. </p>

<p>The Digital Mars D programming language will be the primary project programming language. In addition the project will be using C, XML, XSD and XSLT for aspects of the overall project, such as library language bindings(C), program input configuration(XML), text/data conversion to XML(D, C, XQuery??), XML validation(XSD) and output transformations into HTML and PDF formats(XSLT) etc. </p>

<p>ExamplesD Language bindings for The SWORD Project. Generation of Revised Common Lectionary texts for printing and use as Sunday lectionary readings. Generation of Bible manuscripts in bilingual format for the purposes of cross language and biblical studies. Generation of biblical subsets based on themes, eg. biblical history, prophets, sayings of Jesus, key verse memory lists etc. Generation of interleaved reference / commentary and biblical material for study purposes.</p>
 title : The cachedwebapplication Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A global internet brain is an interconnection of computational devices. This interconnection will enable user to access information from any device. The device may be occassionally connected or persistently connected. In the former case, the devices will be synched when brought online. Both kind of devices are expected to grow at the same rate. Also the interconnection should enable business transaction, education, entertainment, scientific application and enterprise management from anywhere and anyhow. Of course all these access would require priveleges. </p>

<p>On the frontiers of infromation, one application of GIA is semantic web. Semantic web will have information stored in a manner more understandable to the machines which will enable creation of intelligent agent which will deliver information to the users in appropriate format and with less work. am particularly alluding to search engines which has high scope of improvement in terms of amount of work involved in information retrieval To this effect we are creating the format. </p>

<p>HTML used a ground breaking concept of hyperlinking. Although, hyperlinking was built for navigation, people soon realized that it actually represents a relation between two documents. This is semanticism at the crudest level. HTML is a presentation mark-up language. The presentation capabilities in the initial specification was not rich. More richness was added later through style tags.  </p>

<p>The world wide web was imagined as a medium for sharing documents. But it soon grew to be a medium for distributing networked applications. HTML lacked interactive capabilities which was later provided by javascript. At present, HTML enables interactivity through a lot of hacks. </p>

<p>HTML has no semantic structuring of data. This is where XML is so good. It is a brilliant format for creating structured document. XML&#39;s presentation capabilities is low though. Since xml is a document format there is understandably no interactivity.  </p>

<p>So our idea here is to embed a structured document like xml, add the presentation capabilties of HTML, styling of CSS and interactivity of a desktop application. This will provide a perfect platform for content providers who will get the best of the three. When all the document over internet is structured a number of intelligent application will be created that will harness the power of the semantic web and the global internet brain.</p>

<p>or just download (VERSION 1.0) </p>

<p>The 1.0 release works with prototype 1.6 and script.aculo.us 1.8 </p>

<p>How to implement itinclude the javascript files in your HEAD link the colorpicker.css file in your HEAD or Stylesheet add an input field holding the hex color value (without the leading #) initialize the ColorPicker 
<br/>  new Control.ColorPicker(&quot;colorFieldName&quot;);
<br/>Optionsswatch ... specify and ID of an element that will be used as a button to open the colorPicker popUp, and will also display the selected color as it&#39;s background. </p>

<p>IMAGE_BASE ... base URL where the images used for the ColorPicker are located (including the trailling slash) </p>

<p>Callback 	 Description   onOpen 	 Called after the slider popUp is opened.   onClose 	 Called after the slider popUp is closed.   onUpdate 	 Called whenever a user picked a different color. If the user is dragging the slider, or the colorpicker (circle) the update occures onMouseMove.   getPopUpPosition 	 If you want to get control over the position of the colorPicker popUp you may provide this function. ColorPicker expects this function to return an Array with two number values x,y. getPopUpPosition will receive the open event (click) as the only argument. You may access all values and methods of ColorPicker via this.  </p>

<p>Full Example
<br/>color 1 #</p>

<p>color 2 #</p>

<p>color 3 #</p>

<p>color 4 # </p>

<p>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;].each(function(idx) {
<br/>  new Control.ColorPicker(&quot;colorfield&quot; + idx, { IMAGE_BASE : &quot;img/&quot; });
<br/>});
<br/>new Control.ColorPicker(&quot;colorfield4&quot;, { &quot;swatch&quot; : &quot;colorbox4&quot; });
<br/>WARNING: You must not call &quot;new Control.ColorPicker()&quot; unless you closed all wrapping block elements around the form (i.e. divs) - otherwise you will get an exception in IE6/7. If you need to so, use  </p>

<p>Event.observe(window, &quot;load&quot;, function() { 
<br/>  new Control.ColorPicker(&quot;colorfield4&quot;, { &quot;swatch&quot; : &quot;colorbox4&quot; })
<br/>});STYLESHEETTo make the ColorPicker work like it should, you also need to include the colorpicker.css file to your page. </p>

<p>This file defines the appearance of the ColorPicker PopUp and is using the following keys: </p>

<p>With the increase in the amount of data one can access comes the need to have more efficient ways to retrieve the very same data. With the advent of the internet the data one is able to access increased exponentially and still continues to increase at the same pace. Conventional data like documents are comparatively easy to index and processing the same is less intensive. But processing 3D models is a complex task, quite simply because of the way they are stored. They, unlike text documents contain co-ordinates and texture information. They need a different approach to be indexed and to be searched accurately, efficiently and intuitively. The internet is full of thousands if not possibly millions of three dimensional object models. They are the next step in information retrieval systems and search engines. They are the successors to two dimensional pictures. Assume that while shopping one could also rotate and view the product from all angles. Most online sellers already provide such facilities but finding a model of a three dimensional object is a shot in the dark with a search of the files available. What if one did not know the name of the object? What if they just had a model and wanted to find similar models? This task would involve the search and retrieval of 3d models from a large dataset, that too with the ability to show similar shaped models, to to be able to match all models belonging to the specific class or type of the query model, not to mention being able to match objects invariant of deformations and similarity transformations of rotation, scale and translation. Shouldn’t there be a way to look through all possible matches and show us the results. The underlying 3d object detection technology can be applied to many fields including robot navigation, industrial manufacturing, automated driving, robotic surgery, and for recognizing human hand gestures for an improved HCI. </p>

<p>About our project </p>

<p>With the advancement of information technology in our society, we can expect that computer systems to a larger extent to be embedded into our environment. Our dependence on search engines for various tasks is already well established. The internet, over the years, has amassed huge amounts of data that needs to be indexed for efficient retrieval. Currently search engines are capable of indexing only limited types of data, but as our dependence on the internet grows, as the processing power of our desktops increases, so will the types of data we process upon. And thus the need to index the more complex types of data. The internet contains millions of detailed 3D models in a huge category of objects. Searching according to their filenames or through references of the pages they appear in, are at present the only way to search for them, there exists no automated way for comparing one 3D model with a search set and come up with a set of possible matches. Our aim was to develop a reusable engine to be able to search and index 3D meshes. To be able render the possible results and the query model itself. The indexing of 3D models is such a precarious task for the simple reason that the search not only has to be resolution independent as in case of search for two dimensional pictures but it also has to be independent of translation, orientation and distortions. The approach must not only be accurate but also be quick to compute, invariant to transforms, the indexed data must also be condensed enough to be stored. </p>

<p>Problem Description </p>

<p>The problem is to create a 3d model search engine which provides an intuitive query interface for a user to search a query model in a large database of indexed 3d objects both accurately and efficiently. The search engine must devise and implement a shape matching algorithm which is capable of matching shapes with scale, translation, rotation and deformation invariance. The query interface must allow a user to import a 3d model file, render and view the model (ability to rotate and scale the model), and then search the model database for similar models. The user should be able to adjust the engine’s settings to tune the search results’ speed according to the computing resources on the client machine. The interface must also allow search results to be rendered and saved. The application must also have Model Database Manager allowing import, delete, rename, move and view options for models and allowing addition, deletion and renaming of categories. All the models in the database must be indexed with their respective shape descriptors. The search engine should use its own optimized file format for 3d object representation and feature reading and writing model data from the same. We formulate this problem as an model database indexing problem, where the closest matches for a query 3D model are retrieved from a large database of indexed 3D models. The problem is to find the most similar images in a large database of 3D models, given an input query model. The shape descriptor parameters of the retrieved models are used as estimates for the comparison with query 3D model. Each model is labeled with parameters describing its shape parameters. Estimation of 3D models is useful in many applications, ranging from the 3D object search to human-computer interaction to automated recognition of sign languages. </p>

<p>Compilation du code.« Dictionnaire le Littré » est compatible avec une multitude de plates-formes informatiques. Le code de « Dictionnaire le Littré » repose exclusivement sur la bibliothèque Qt, qui permet de créer des fichiers exécutables pour Macintosh, tout comme pour Linux ou Windows, et ce, sans rien changer à la source. Voici comment : </p>

<p>Télécharger l&#39;archive Littre-source-2.0.tar.bz2 dans un coin de votre disque dur. Extraire le dossier qui s&#39;y trouve. Installer Qt SDK LGPL pour la plate-forme voulue. Une fois l&#39;installation terminée, cliquer sur l&#39;icône Qt Creator. Choisir File &gt; Open... et ouvrir le fichier Littre.pro (extrait à l&#39;étape 2). Choisir Build &gt; Build All dans le menu de Qt Creator. Le fichier exécutable Littre est alors créé dans le sous-dossier bin (voir l&#39;étape 2). Avec d&#39;importantes modifications et les outils appropriés, il est même possible de compiler « Dictionnaire le Littré » pour Windows CE ou Symbian OS. </p>

<p>Accessibilité.Lorsque vous lancez « Dictionnaire le Littré », il décèle la présence de lecteurs d’écran, destinés aux personnes aveugles ou malvoyantes. Le texte « Mode accessible » apparaît alors dans le titre de la fenêtre principale, et l&#39;interface devient lisible par la synthèse vocale. Il faut dire que la bibliothèque Qt, sur laquelle repose le logiciel, ne produit presque rien d&#39;accessible. Il m&#39;a fallu parfois des pages de code pour décrire imparfaitement un menu ou une zone de liste. Il s&#39;agit d&#39;un travail artisanal et parcellaire, mais j&#39;ose croire qu&#39;il profitera à certains d&#39;entre vous. Je garantis de bons résultats avec le lecteur libre NVDA. </p>

 summary : <p>Garuda Messenger is a Chat Service Client. There are many chat services on the internet like Yahoo, MSN, AIM, Google Talk etc. Garuda aims to provide a client environment to all those messenger services under one roof. So that users who have accounts in all those services need not download and use separate clients for each one of them. With Garuda you can use only one client and access those services, thus avoiding confusion for novice users of internet. Garuda is inspired from other such softwares like Gaim(Currently Pidgin) and Miranda. Presently, Garuda Messenger is a client for only Google Talk (Jabber Protocol). Soon other messenger service clients will be integrated. Requirements: CPU: 800 MHz Intel or AMD CPU RAM: 256MB RAM or more OS: Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista .NET Framework 2.0 or above (Vista users need not download .NET framework separately) Internet Explorer 6.0 or above Flash plug-in for Internet Explorer (Optional) – For the video playback </p>

<p>How to send videos to a friend: For YouTube videos, you can send the link of the video page as a message to your friend. Video will be displayed automatically inside chat window for you as well as your friend. For other sites however, you must follow couple of steps.  Copy the embedded source text of the video that the website provides.  Type “video:” without quotes in the chat window and then paste the embedded source text that you copied in the first step So for example the website provides a source like - </p>

<p>The greatest video ever made Then the message you have to send will be:  video:The greatest video ever made </p>

<p>How to send images/pictures to a friend: You can send images in the same way. Replace the first word (‘video’ in above case) with image and the embedded source with link of the image. So to send an image with link , message will be  image: </p>

<p>Customizing the chat window: To customize chat window, open any chat window, save that conversation as html page with file name &quot;BoxTemplate&quot; (without quotes. full filename should be BoxTemplate.html ) in the same directory the executable is located. You can edit this html page to your heart’s content so long as you keep the JavaScript functions you find in it as messages r printed out using those functions. Edit those functions carefully to modify message printing recommend using absolute file paths inside BoxTemplate, instead of relative linking. Hit the reload button in chat window to refresh it with edited page. All messages will be lost in that window. So beware.</p>

 title : The helpyourself Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>If you use Adobe Photoshop Elements to organise your photo collection and are wanting a way to share your ENTIRE photo collection (along with its organisation - tags, collections etc) with your fiends and family, then HelpYourself might be the answer.</p>

<p>What is HelpYourself?
<br/>---------------------
<br/>HelpYourself is a Java web application that you can run on your own PC to share your photos (all of them) using your own internet connection.  Because you use your own PC and internet connection, the only limits are how many photos your PC can store and how much bandwidth your ISP provides.</p>

<p>What are HelpYourself&#39;s Features?
<br/>---------------------------------
<br/>HelpYourself uses an interface VERY similar to Adobe Photoshop Elements, and will preserve/show your tags, collections, imports, and just like Adobe Photoshop Elements, it allows searching for photos using any tag combination.</p>

<p>HelpYourself will allow revealing stacked photos (using a simpler mechanism than Photoshop Elements!) - just click the stack icon.</p>

<p>HelpYourself shows the caption you enter for a photo and also any notes.  It also shows the metadata from your photo, in either a brief or complete format, much like Adobe Photoshop Elements.</p>

<p>HelpYourself will show smaller versions of your photos by default that are better for browsing on a web page, but it also allows downloading the original version of each photo, allowing your friends and family to help themselves to the photos they want rather than having to ask you to send them the originals.  Hence the name: HelpYourself.</p>

<p>HelpYourself tracks and shows the number of times each photo is &#39;hit&#39; and the number of times each photo is downloaded.</p>

<p>HelpYourself supports RSS feeds so those who need to know as soon as you import a new set of photos, or photos with a particular tag combination and use their favorite RSS browser to do so.</p>

<p>HelpYourself allows you to keep some of your photos private - in addition to those you have tagged as &#39;hidden&#39; in your catalog you can specify any additional tags that should not be shown.</p>

<p>HelpYourself allows you to password protect your entire collection just in case you don&#39;t want just anyone looking at your photos.</p>

<p>HelpYourself automatically detects and shows updates to your catalog (eg. new photos imported, or existing photos modified - tags changed etc).</p>

<p>What are HelpYourself&#39;s Limits?
<br/>-------------------------------
<br/>HelpYourself currently only supports JPEG photos.</p>

<p>HelpYourself does not support archived photos - your photos must be permanently located on your PC.</p>

<p>HelpYourself has only been tested with Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 for Windows, though it was originally developed for Adobe Photoshop Album 2, so it may still work with PSA2.</p>

<p>HelpYourself is best viewed with the Mozilla Firefox browser. (No, really. Internet Explorer 6 doesn&#39;t support transparency in PNG format images which HelpYourself makes use of, although IE 7 beta is better.)</p>

<p>What do I need to run HelpYourself?
<br/>-----------------------------------
<br/>In order to run HelpYourself, you will require
<br/>1) Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 (for Windows)
<br/>2) Java 5 Development Kit
<br/>3) Apache Tomcat 5.5
<br/>4) Knowledge to expose your webserver to anyone you want to share your photos with on the Internet</p>

 title : The hotels-travel-booking-internet-software Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Reservation System to simplify the task of online booking, provides users a unique, intuitive and easy to use interface that improves the way people use the web. Online reservation system for hotels, properties, motels and b&amp;bs. </p>

<p>The site that I made : http://www.israeldeal.com , http://www.israel-travel-agency.com </p>

<p>The lodging industry is well represented over the internet but sometimes it is hard to find hotel names, official contact info as telephone numbers, website and email address. Search engine results for accommodation or travel search queries will return hundreds or thosusands of results from hotel reservation services or their affiliated websites but not from the actual hotels websites. </p>

<p>These project will help to the hotels or travel agencies to sell there services by internet, update and add information immediate, directly, without unnecessary dealer&#39;s supplement. </p>

<p>These project will help to the customer to contact hotels, travel agency directly for getting cheap prices. </p>

<p>I am looking for hotels owners, travel agencies(or related to the travel business)  from all over the world. </p>

<p>If you are intrested this idea, Please contact me. </p>

 title : The htrsh Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WHAT IS HTRSH?HTRSH (Hyper Text Remote Shell) is similar to the remote shell (rsh) but it works right in your web browser using HTTP or HTTPS protocol for data transfering. </p>

<p>USERS TARGETFor all users who cannot use remote shells (e.g. ssh, rsh, telnet, etc..) to access some hosts connected to the Internet. The reason of it may be unavailability of external access to the Internet, strict rules of the firewall, NAT (Network Address Translator) and so on. In such case, htrsh may help you to admin your host or server via your Web browser everywhere! Or are you Web geek? Then it is for you! </p>

<p>HOW IT WORKShtrsh consists two applications work together:  </p>

<p>It is server part (hereinafter just the server) and interface part (hereinafter the client). You just configure and run the server on a host you are willing to access. For example, it may be your home or work computer.  </p>

<p>The client works on some host in the Internet (e.g. on free Web hosting). The client &quot;draws&quot; special web interface you work with via your Web browser. </p>

<p>The client can show special web &quot;terminal&quot; which provide working with remote host. The console (terminal) is similar to the standart UNIX/Linux or MS Windows console depends from OS installed on the remote host (the server side). While you are working with the terminal,  the server periodically &quot;asks&quot; the client for new commands to do. You just type commands in the console as usual, and the server executes them and send results to the client to show its in the console (in your Web browser!).  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pay attention, that this technology works with out opening any ports on your system (where the server is running), it is just http(s) requests!!! </p>

<p>PROJECT STATUSIndeed, the program is being developed and has not been released yet. </p>

<p>TECHNOLOGIESThe server is cross platform application which is being written with ANSI C using cURL cross platform library (Cygwin for Windows version).  </p>

<p>The client is cross platform application either, it is the web interface is being written with PHP and Prototype Java Script library making extensive use of AJAX for better responsiveness. </p>

 summary : <p>HuawaY! es un simple proyecto dedica a generar un asistente para la instalación de Modéms ADSL USB bajo sistemas GNU/Linux. Intenta proporcionar una interfaz amigable para aquellos usuarios principiantes en sistemas Linux. Asi mismo otro de los objetivos es darle al usuario las herramientas para que pueda tomar el control de las acciones que esta realizando. </p>

<p>La idea es soportar otros modéms, en un futuro no muy lejano.  Actualmente HuawaY! se encuentra en fase beta.  </p>

<p>Sobre la información del modém:El modem es reconocido muy bien por los nucleos GNU/Linux 2.5 en adelante.  Sucede que éste tipo de modems requieren un software cerrado al que se donomina firmware. También las distribuciones necesitan software adicional para volver operativo y funcional al modém. </p>

<p>Por todo lo anterior mencionado, hemos desarrollado un instalador fácil para modéms USB ADSL. Solo hay que obedecer al pie de la letra las instrucciones. </p>

 title : The layer9 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Layer9This project is designed for security. The code is designed to be open source, but not advertised. Please try not to advertise that you use or develop for Layer9... use it between friends. </p>

<p>Project DescriptionL9 is designed to be the next generation of internet communication. 2008 is the 20 year anniversary of the birth of Internet Relay Chat - 1988 is ages ago on the timescale of the internet. It&#39;s time for something new... a revolution is in order. </p>

<p>Design GoalsThere are a number of goals that L9 attempts to meet (not necessarily in this order): </p>

<p>1. It has to be &#39;untappable&#39;. A reasonable level of privacy can be achieved in a &quot;mesh&quot; network layout. </p>

<p>2. It cannot be in control of any single party. Lessons learned from IRC - AIM and Google Talk are not secure ways to communicate. </p>

<p>3. It has to be really, really easy to use. If the goal is adopt all end users, including people who are not computer literate, we need to KIS. </p>

<p>4. It has to be easy to install, manage, and maintain. With a lightweight, easy-to-use server daemon, it&#39;s easier for people to find justification for hosting a relay. </p>

<p>5. It has to be very, very secure. Using new concepts in computing like port knocking, token authentication, and one time passwords, while combining more mature technologies like PKI, symmetric encryption, and steganography, we can achieve a new level of security. </p>

<p>6. It has to be undetectable. You should be able to use it in any environment, no matter how hostile. </p>

<p>7. It should be available anywhere. You should be able to sit down at any computer, and with reasonable (non-admin) permissions, be able to connect to the system and begin communication. </p>

<p>InspirationsThere are a number of legacy projects that inspired L9. Namely, the now abandoned WASTE project, and Internet Relay Chat. Concepts from these protocols will be used extensively.</p>

<p>WhyDownload videos from youtube to your computer  Carry it on your iphone, ipod, psp, etc. for watching it when you don&#39;t have broadband Extract audio from songs, convert them to ringtones    HowDownload &amp; run the setup After installation finishes, run medpiper.exe from your install directory  Enter the URL for a video on youtube &amp; the file name for saving the video on your computer Hit Fetch &amp; wait :)  Video would be saved in your installation folder (default is C:\Program Files\medpiper) or the path you specified in &quot;file name&quot; above MoreThe software finds the main video from a youtube page and downloads it as a flash (.flv) file It then converts it to the selected format (currently mpeg only) that most computers and portable players can handle Unchecking the download or convert box would disable the above steps respectively e.g. if you already have a .flv file that you want to convert to mpeg, disable download option. TroubleshootingIf downloader works and you see a &#39;.flv&#39; file but no &#39;.mpeg&#39; file its likely that my ffmpeg build didn&#39;t work on your machine.

 title : The mlb-squeezeday Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>StatusStatus as of May 5, 2009: Only works with alternate (second language) audio feeds. </p>

<p>Getting this plugin working again (for anything other than the alternate language broadcasts :) will take some doing. </p>

<p>The good news is that as of May 5 mlbviewer is able to get MLB Gameday Audio (and Video) feeds, convert them to FLV with rtmpdump, and play the result with mplayer.  The author posted this summary of how mlbviewer gets the RTMP URL. </p>

<p>Ideally the SqueezeBox would support RTMP natively, removing the need for rtmpdump, but I don&#39;t know whether or when that might happen. </p>

<p>In the meantime, conceptually it should be possible to feed the FLV to the SqueezeBox instead of to mplayer.   I don&#39;t know enough about SqueezeCenter&#39;s APIs to say if this would be straightforward. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a lot of cycles to spare right now, but I&#39;m happy to provide any pointers to anyone who&#39;d like to dig in and apply daftcat&#39;s experience with mlbviewer to mlb-squeezeday. </p>

<p>DescriptionPlugin to play MLB Gameday Audio through your Squeezebox audio player. </p>

<p>Subscription to MLB Gameday Audio required. </p>

<p>InstallationWindows:  </p>

<p>Download mlb-squeezeday-0.1.2-win32-x86-perl-5.8-openssl-0.9.8g.zip </p>

<p>Unix, Mac:  </p>

<p>Make sure you have IO::Socket::SSL, Net::SSLeay, and OpenSSL installed. Download mlb-squeezeday-0.1.2-1.zip Mac: see additional note below. </p>

<p>All: Unzip the zip file, and copy the MLBGameday directory to the SqueezeCenter plugins directory. </p>

<p>Stop and restart SqueezeCenter. </p>

<p>Through the Web UI, configure the plugin with your MLB Gameday email address and password -- e.g. http://localhost:9000/settings/plugins/MLBGameday/settings/basic.html </p>

<p>Navigate to Internet Radio:MLBGameday, browse to an in progress game and then to a station, and play. </p>

<p>MacTo get the SSL dependencies (IO::Socket::SSL, Net::SSLeay, OpenSSL): </p>

<p>Install appropriate XCode developer tools from Apple&#39;s Developer Connection site, http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/ To install OpenSSL, download the source for 0.9.8g or later, configure, and build -- ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install To install Net::SSLeay and IO::Socket::SSL, use CPAN -- sudo perl -MCPAN -e &#39;install Net::SSLeay&#39; ; sudo perl -MCPAN -e &#39;install IO::Socket::SSL&#39; Restart SqueezeCenter </p>

<p>Thanks to radiomd for figuring out how to get the Mac prerequisites. </p>

<p>Known issuesUser&#39;s MLB Gameday password stored in plain text in Plugin prefs file on server. Does not work for archived games. Does not work through web UI. Does not work for Softsqueeze emulator. TroubleshootingMLB Gameday does not appear in Radio menuCause 1: Plugin not installed properly. Confirmation: If the directory server/Plugins/MLBGameday is missing or empty, then this is the problem. Resolution: Reinstall. Cause 2: Plugin failed to load. Confirmation: Check server.log for error messages. Resolution: File a bug report with the relevant section of server.log and the version numbers of your operating system, SqueezeCenter and the MLBGameday plugin. Final possibility: make sure you&#39;re connected to SqueezeCenter, not SqueezeNetwork. --- </p>

<p>Error message: SSL dependencies not foundCause 1: OpenSSL and/or Net::SSLeay not installed Confirmation: Run the following command.  Errors indicate that the dependencies are in fact missing: perl -e &#39;use IO::Socket::SSL&#39;. Resolution: Install OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay. Cause 2: OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay are installed, but are not on SqueezeCenter&#39;s search path. Resolution: Run SqueezeCenter (slimserver.pl) from the command line. Cause 3: (Windows only) -- The contents of the zip file were not all copied to the Plugins directory; or you downloaded the generic zip instead of the Windows zip bundled with OpenSSL. Confirmation: If C:/Program Files/\SqueezeCenter/Plugins/MLBGameday/lib is missing the Net or IO directories, then this is the problem.  Resolution: Download the Windows zip, and use the &#39;Extract all&#39; button to extract the contents of the zip file to the Plugins directory. Error message: MLB Gameday login failedCause: MLB Gameday Audio emailAddress/password not configured or incorrect Confirmation: Verify that you can login to MLB Gameday through your web browser at http://mlb.mlb.com/mediacenter/index.jsp and listen to live games. Resolution: Reconfigure the plugin emailAddress/password through the web interface, e.g. http://localhost:9000/plugins/MLBGameday/settings/basic.html Error message: ...Cause: MLB Gameday Audio website is having problems. Confirmation: Check whether you are able to play MLB Gameday Audio games through the Web UI at http://mlb.mlb.com/mediacenter/index.jsp Resolution: Wait for the MLB Gameday Audio site to resume service.</p>

<p>Second, write a wiki page that discusses how you intend to work as a group.  In particular, what mechanism will you use to facilitate a short, daily meeting among the team members?  You should model your team process after the Scrum methodology.   </p>

<p>Finally, you need to learn how to use JAXB to manipulate XML using Java.  The way JAXB works, in a nutshell, is like this:  </p>

<p>Design your XML data representation. In particular, implement an XmlSchema definition for each type of object you are manipulating.  Install JAXB 2.0 (unless you&#39;re using Java 6, in which case it comes pre-installed.)  Run the XJC compiler, giving it as input your XmlSchema definition. It will blast out a bunch of Java class definitions that correspond to your XmlSchema and that are specially suited to processing by JAXB classes.  Compile your newly generated Java classes, and then use the JAXB &quot;Marshaller&quot; class to translate Java to XML, and the JAXB &quot;Unmarshaller&quot; class to go from XML to Java.  This sounds complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it is really quite straightforward.</p>

 title : The nzb-cli Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>nzbNozbe.com is a GTD web application that also has iPhone interface. Although the site is intuitive, after a while it felt that command line interface would sagnificantly improve the experience. nzb is meant to complement nozbe.com, quicken the most common operations at a time when you work at your main computer, which for me is pretty much most of the time. </p>

<p>Everything is synced with the nozbe.com, so that you have access to the actions from the browser (on different computer), as well as iPhone. nzb provides only subset of the functionality of nozbe.com, on which it relies for such tasks as creating projects and contexts. </p>

<p>nzb is developed incrementally, features are added in the order of their value-added. Currently it allows to list next actions; add an action; and mark an action as done. It is the smallest subset that I felt I could release. More functionality will be added soon. You are welcome to add feature requests on the Issues page. </p>

<p>Who might be interestedPeople who are already using Nozbe and shell. </p>

<p>InstallationThere are two featured downloads at the moment. One for Windows and one for Ubuntu, which I expect to work in other distributions too (please let me know if I am wrong). </p>

<p>The archive contains a single executable file, which you may put on your path for convenience. On first run, nzb will ask you for the email and password. </p>

<p>UsageTo display help </p>

<p>$ nzb --helpTo display the list of next actions issue: </p>

<p>$ nzb
<br/>1. do loundry
<br/>2. call John
<br/>3. buy Resolver OneIt displays all the not-done next actions. </p>

<p>As you see, the list of actions comes out ordered. After you called John, you check an action (mark as done) as follows: </p>

<p>$ nzb check 2
<br/>1. do loundry
<br/>2. buy Resolver OneIt prints the list, as it is after marking &quot;call John&quot; as done. You can check more then one action at a time simply by providing more identifiers after check. </p>

<p>You can filter the actions by contexts. To display actions in Computer or Internet: </p>

<p>$ nzb Computer Internet
<br/>1. buy Resolver OneIt is important to understand how the actions are numbered. The numbering is context sensitive. </p>

<p>$ nzb 
<br/>1. do loundry
<br/>2. buy Resolver One
<br/>$ nzb Computer Internet
<br/>1. buy Resolver One&#39;buy Resolver One&#39; action has different number, depending on the filtering. To check it you could either,  </p>

<p>$ nzb check 2
<br/>1. do loundryor  </p>

<p>$ nzb Computer Internet check 1The secound would not print anything, as there would be no more actions left in Computer or Internet contexts. </p>

<p>Assuming we haven&#39;t checked the &#39;do loundry&#39; action, let&#39;s add another action to Home context: </p>

<p>$ nzb Home add &#39;water the plants&#39;
<br/>1. water the plants
<br/>2. do loundryIt is added to Inbox project, the list of actions in the Home context is printed. </p>

<p>In dos prompt, use duble quotes rather than single quotes. </p>

<p>There is a special case: </p>

<p>$ nzb add &#39;action&#39;Adds an action to the Computer context, but prints next actions from all the contexts. </p>
