 title : The x-rms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Most specifications (describing requirements, tests, constraints/hazards, and design approaches) for complex systems are hosted either in databases, in documents, or in wiki&#39;s. All approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. Database-based system tend to be expensive and proprietary, and conversion systems are needed to generate document &quot;views&quot; onto the data that can be read by stakeholders and persisted in a document control system. Database approaches provide great flexibility and enable linking between requirements and related artifacts like tests, design details, constraints, parent requirements, and hazards. Document-based systems are inexpensive and easy to set up, but lack a mechanism to link requirements to related artifacts. It can also be hard to maintain consistency in document formatting and content with multiple spec authors at work. Wikis provide easy access to project stakeholders, but don&#39;t lend themselves to structured and consistent information formatting. Linking wiki pages and table records can be manually intensive, and creating print-quality documents can be difficult. </p>

<p>LSpeX combines the power of a database-driven RMS system with the simplicity and low cost of document and wiki-driven systems. All requirements and related artifacts are persisted in XML, with one XML file created per requirement, test, hazard, or design specification. Each specification type has an associated schema to ensure compliance to organization-specific specification norms. XSL-FO is used to transform the XML-based specifications into a set of PDF documents. The key feature of the resulting PDF documents is a rich set of internal and external links. The links help management complexity by making it easy to navigate between related specifications. For example, links connect individual requirements to the test protocols that demonstrate their complete implementation, and to the constraints or hazards that motivate their existence. PDF redlines can be automatically generated for change management activities.  </p>

<p>The entire system is customizable through a set of XSLT files, and is powered by Xalan and FOP (both open source). Plugins can be created to connect the system to wiki&#39;s and document control systems to make specification reading and controlled editing easy.</p>

 title : The xmlcontenteditor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an application that I use to manage my website.  The application communicates to a php script that sits on my webserver using HTTP.  The PHP script allows me to create, read, update and delete XML files that without needing to FTP into the site and upload files manually.  The application uses the remote web service to manage content; it automatically sucks down all files from the server and displays the websites files and folders and allows new ones to be created.  It also has backup and restore functionality, which is the only thing that, at the time of this writing, is not completely finished. </p>

<p>The XML files are transformed using XSLT into HTML.  When you browse my website, the index.php script opens the XML file and transforms it; all of the links within the site are generated such that they point back to the index.php script.  A query string argument tells the script which XML file needs to be transformed.  In the absence of a query string argument, the website will open the default home page. </p>

<p>This project contains several pieces.  One piece is the windows application, which is written in .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008.  Another piece is the website itself.  I have included two directories in the website folder that are critical to the workings of the project.  The first is an XSLT directory, where I store the XSLT transforms.  The second is the XML folder, where I store the management webservice, and where I keep the content files.  The root folder has the index.php script, which shows how the transformation is seamlessly hidden from the users browsing the website. </p>

<p>At some point, I will have a tutorial up on my website that illustrates how this whole project works.  You can subscribe to the RSS feed so that you can be notified of when that articles goes up. </p>

<p>We can enhance this CMS and make it a good one, and more robust.   </p>

<p>1) We need to put database for ecommerce in the admin, and much nicer GUI, so we can do reports on sales. 2) We need to add one more GUI layer on top, so it can simplify the page creation more.  That is when we create a new page, all the functions are called and create a page. 3) We need to implement drag and drop functions so we can drag a component and drop it on the new page. 4) I need to write an English version for instruction.  :) sorry folks, too busy with other designs. </p>

 summary : <p>© Jan (Honza) Javorek </p>

<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT IS IDLE. Development of Joss doesn&#39;t continue anymore, but current version works fine. If you are interested in programming Joss, let me know. </p>

<p>VÝVOJ TOHOTO PROJEKTU NEPOKRAČUJE. Vývoj Jossu nepokračuje, ale současná verze funguje dobře. Pokud máš zájem ve vývoji pokračovat, dej mi vědět. </p>

<p>Joss (en)Joss is a simple web-based program, which allows you to create and administrate your own website in a very, very simple and easy way. Too intelligent people calls it CMS (content management system) or framework. </p>

<p>Joss believes if it is kind and friendly to others, they will too. Joss would like to be a really simple and fast CMS. At the same time it is not afraid of the latest web technologies and hopes it can restrain them to be useful and well implemented. </p>

<p>Code is written in object PHP 5 and uses or plans to use technologies XML, XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in the most upstanding way. </p>

<p>Thanks to all who encouraged me to the creation of Joss by releasing their great projects and ideas as Open Source. Especially thanks to the genius David Grudl and my friend Michal Wiglasz. Joss derive benefits from containing a code of Texy! formatter and some parts of Nette framework. </p>

<p>Joss (cs)Joss je jednoduchý webový program, díky němuž si můžeš velmi snadno tvořit a spravovat své vlastní stránky. Přehnaně inteligentní lidé tomu říkají framework, RS (redakční systém) nebo CMS (content management system, systém pro správu obsahu). </p>

<p>Joss si vyhrazuje právo všem okolo tykat. Věří, že když bude k druhým co nejvíce přátelský, bude mu opláceno stejně. Chtěl by být opravdu jednoduchým a rychlým redakčním systémem. Zároveň se nebojí nejnovějších technologií a doufá, že se mu podaří je zkrotit tak, aby byly prospěšné a implementovány správně. </p>

<p>Kód je napsán v objektovém PHP 5 a využívá nebo hodlá využívat co nejpoctivěji technologií XML, XHTML, CSS a JavaScript. </p>

<p>Díky všem, kteří umožnili vznik Joss vydáním svých skvělých projektů a myšlenek jako Open Source. Především to byli génius David Grudl a můj přítel Michal Wiglasz. Projekt těží z toho, že využívá kód formátovače Texy!, některých částí frameworku Nette.</p>

 title : The lagrange-cms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Lagrange CMSLagrange is new Content Management System that aims to be simple enough for mainstream internet users to administer their web site, yet have enough power and flexibility to be deployed in an enterprise environment. The primary goal of Lagrange is to make it simple enough that you don&#39;t have to employ web developer in order to administer a site.  </p>

<p>Goals </p>

<p>Focus on actual content management and not site design. Rather than focus on things that make the site design easy, Lagrange should merely facilitate the integration of an existing site design into set templates and allow for easy creation of new pages from templates and editing of content areas. Utilise DHTML and AJAX almost exclusively within the admin console. The idea being that a CMS should feel more like an application that makes web pages, not a web page that makes other web pages. Be secure Support multiple users and roles  Support offline editing of site with the ability to publish at a later time. Facilitate integration with version control Framework to allow for community plugin development Run purely on free software    Language &amp; Platforms </p>

<p>Lagrange is written in PHP and employs Ext JS 2.0 for the admin consoles front-end interface. MySQL is used for data storage.</p>

 title : The maxsite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MaxSite CMS предназначена для создания сайтов различной сложности. Из-за того, что я долго занимался поддержкой русского WordPress, перед своей системой я поставил задачу сделать так, чтобы MaxSite CMS полностью перекрывала возможности WordPress. </p>

<p>При этом очень большое внимание уделено ресурсопотреблению, скорости и расширяемости. </p>

<p>Простая установка. Следуя несложной инструкции нужно указать параметры базы данных. Дальше инсталяция пройдет автоматически. Скорость работы. За счет продуманной архитектуры системы, MaxSite CMS работает очень быстро. По некоторым оценкам WordPress работает примерно в 5-10 раз медленнее. Небольшой размер системы. В распакованном виде это примерно 2,5Мб. Это с учетом того, что в комплекте 39 плагинов (в версии 0.22). Небольшая ресурсоемкость. В среднем MaxSite CMS потребляет (php) около 3Мб. Максимум, что мне приходилось видеть - 4Мб. И это при всех включенных плагинах. Это даже не стоит сравнивать с WordPress, который обычно требует от 9 (ранних версий) до 20Мб (последних версий). MaxSite CMS использует фреймворк CodeIgniter. Поэтому разработчику автоматически доступны богатые средства CodeIgniter: бибиотеки, хелперы, API для работы с базой данных и т.д. Стоит также отметить, что CodeIgniter считается одним из самых быстрых и удобных фреймворков. Развитая система кэширования. Кэширование - часть системы и механизм кэширования очень простой. Поэтому у него высокая скорость и легкость использования в произвольных частях кода. Гибкая система типов данных. На MaxSite CMS можно забыть про ограничения WordPress на типы данных и страниц. Вы можете придумывать свои типы данных, свою систему навигации и т.д. MaxSite CMS не выполняет лишнего кода. При инициализации системы выполняется только «ядро» и подключаются активированные плагины. После этого управление передается шаблону. Поэтому система будет выполнять ровно тот код, который вы ей укажете. Это принципиально отличается от WordPress, в котором выполняется весь код, получаются все данные, а уже потом у разработчика есть возможность что-то с ним делать. С MaxSite CMS у вас полный контроль. Шаблоны для MaxSite CMS не сложнее вордпрессовских. Последние версии шаблона default позволяют другим шаблонам использовать его функциональность для вывода разных типов данных. Такми образом, содание шаблона для MaxSite CMS по сути сводится к обычной верстке. SEO-frendly. В MaxSite CMS можно указывать title, keywords, descriptions для каждой страницы. Можно указать дефолтные значения, а также различные комбинации. Мета-данные страниц имеют структуру ini-файла. За счет этого добавить метаполе (дополнительную информацию к странице) можно вообще без программирования. Опции, настойки также могут быть выполнены в виде ini-файла. Это значительно упрощает их добавление/редактирование. Система разрешений авторов работает по принципу групп. Вы можете создавать разные группы и отмечать нужные для них действия. Система комментирования позволяет оставлять комментарии анонимам, а также т.н. комюзерам - зарегистрированным. Причем регистрация происходит автоматически в момент комментирования. Данные комюзеров хранятся в отдельной базе и позволяют на её основе выполнять любые манипуляции. Главный плюс такого деления в том, что у комюзеров нет доступа в админ-панель. Полная поддержка виджетов. В MaxSite CMS создать виджет очень просто за счет продуманного API. В отличие от WordPress&#39;а, который позволяет устанвливать только один виджет для одного плагина, в MaxSite CMS любой виджет может использоваться сколько угодно раз. MaxSite CMS расширяется за счет плагинов. В отличие от бардака WordPress, в MaxSite CMS используется строгое именование и за счет вспомогательных функций плагины получаются небольшими. Для примера, плагин антиспама, который имеет свою страницу настроек имеет размер всего 13кб. Плагины в которых только виджеты - еще меньше - 2-5Кб. Шаблоны для админ-панели очень просты. Например дефолтный шаблон - это 9Кб. В шаблоне используется нормальный html и css, в которых разберется даже школьник. smile Поэтому, если потребуется сделать свой «фирменный» стиль админки, проблем не будет. Функциональность админ-панели определяется точно такими же плагинами. Разница только в том, что эти плагины прописаны в коде и автоматически активируются при входе в админ-панель. Таким образом любой плагин может добавить себя в админ-панель. При этом все они используют единый несложный API. В админ-панели существует возможность настраивать шаблон. В отличие от WordPress, где данная возможность реализуется очень сложно, в MaxSite CMS для этого достаточно разместить в каталоге шаблона один файл options.ini. Таким образом шаблон можно сделать полностью настраиваемым. Для создания плагинов в комплекте поставки присутствуют файлы template-... для разных вариантов: только виджет, просто плагин, плагин с настройков в админ-панели, полный вариант. В комплекте следующие плагины: Блокировка по IP, Антиспам, BBCode, Календарь, Капча-антиспам, Облако рубрик, Вывод рубрик, Кнопки для комментирования, Счетчик переходов по ссылке, Виджет событий, Виджет Избранное, Последние комментарии, Последние записи, LightBox с галереей (картинки загружаются и автоматически подготавливаются для галереи, код галереи генерируется автоматически), Виджет для ссылок, Виджет для формы логина, Самое комментируемое, Самое читаемое, Пагинация (листание страниц), Плагин перелинковки страниц, Преобразование PRE в список OL, Псевдокод, Случайные страницы, Цитаты или случайный текст, Рейтинг страниц в виде звездочек, Форма поиска, Карта сайта (архив), Смайлики, Облако меток, Текстовый блок (html/php), Twitter (rss-агрегатор), XML-sitemap, Ушки, Sape, случайные галереи. Плагины постоянно добавляются, поэтому их количество будет только увеличиваться. Существует конвертер данных из WordPress. В комплекте поставки входят magpierss и jquery (+UI).

 title : The olimpotools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Olimpo tools is the name of the tools that I want to share with you all. There will be a Data Access Layer Object and a Content Manager System developed in .NET (C#) that compile with .NET Framework 2.0/3.5/4.0 and Mono Stable version. </p>

<p>The DAL is called Generic Database Access Layer and use Refletion to generate the SQL Statements. In the future will use LINQ. </p>

<p>Olimpo Content Manager SystemOlimpo CMS it&#39;s a part of OlimpoTools and it&#39;s a configurable Content Manager System by independent modules. </p>

<p>ModulesUsing Olimpo CMS will save you money because there are several pre-developed modules that you can use like: </p>

<p>User Management - You can add user management support to you WebSite and give them specific access to certain areas of your application. Text Management - Almost all the information in the WebSite are plain-text pages. You can create content for your page using a rich text box. Photo Galleries - You can add photos to your WebSite and show then in a organize way. etc. Install new ModulesInstalling new modules in Olimpo CMS it&#39;s easy. You just need to access the Administration page and in the Install New Modules feature add the link to the service that you want to install. Automaticly Olimpo CMS will list all the available modules that you can install on your WebSite. After choose the module you just need to click on Install. </p>

<p>Olimpo CSM will be bind to this installation WebSite and every time there is a new version of the installed modules, the system will notify the WebSite administrator. </p>

<p>Customize your WebSiteOlimpo CMS will provide a tool that any user can use to customize each page or a bunch of pages of the WebSite. We will try that common user don&#39;t need to know HTML or even CSS to customize the WebSite. </p>

<p>Developing ModulesBecause we can&#39;t reach all the end user specifications, anyone can develop a Olimpo CMS Module using Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010 or MonoDevelop. Knowledge of C# is required to develop Olimpo CMS Modules, but you can use any other .NET Framework language too. </p>

<p>Basic developement toolsOlimpo CMS use SQL Server database (MySQL in the future) with Entity Framework / NHibernate as the working ORM. (For now we are trying to reach a decision about this) </p>

 summary : <p>This is a content management system based on the popular MVC framework Code Igniter (http://codeigniter.com/). </p>

<p>We hope to build this as a flexible cms that can be used in many possible ways, while keeping it with new flavors. The ultimate goal is to make it a revolutionary product. </p>

<p>The status of this project is: Just Started. So I&#39;d recommend you stay tuned with the SVN source every week or so, as the progress will take place. The proper URL for you to checkout is: https://rev-cms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rev-cms </p>

<p>You can use pretty much all sorts of SVN clients. I recommend TortoiseSVN, you can get it here: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in helping us developing this project, please contact me at runzhou.li@gmail.com, with any positive means you can offer, including joining this project. </p>

<p>The current road map is to finish up the basic back-end and front-end models, so we can have a ready to go product that is somewhat suitable for other developers to grab and re-develop based on what we have. </p>

<p>Aspxshell -- 新型.net一句话管理端by cnqing 2008-11-3  </p>

<p>没有太多的言语更多的时间都在coding... </p>

<p>参照&quot;倒转雅典娜&quot;我也采用Q/A的方式介绍Aspxshell. </p>

<p>Q: 什么是Aspxshell?  </p>

<p>A: Aspxshell 如同以往流行的asp/php一句话，是.net平台的一句话管理端。 </p>

<p>Q: 如何使用Aspxshell?  </p>

<p>A: 将服务端shell.aspx上传至服务器，修改里面的&quot;psw&quot;为你自己的密码，然后在本地的客户端shell管理器中新增你刚才的url和psw就可以使用各个模块的功能了。 </p>

<p>Q: Aspxshell同其他一句话有什么区别？  </p>

<p>A:  平台不一样 </p>

<p>2.基于平台本身的不同aspxshell利用.net内置丰富资源相对asp/php可以做更多的事，例如  
<br/>socket。 </p>

<p>3.客户端容易开发，开源代码和模块化的设计可以让更多的人参与到其中完成不同的插件。 
<br/>4.asp/php通过eval方法执行客户端的功能代码，aspxshell通过编译好的程序集+参数执行客户端功能模块。 
<br/>Q: 为什么要开源 </p>

<p>A:  </p>

<p>开源是一种精神 2.只有开源才能更丰富aspxshell的插件 
<br/>3.开源同样是为了让更多的人学习和被学习 
<br/>Q：Aspxshell是用什么语言开发的，对系统有什么要求？ </p>

<p>A：Aspxshell采用绝大多数.net程序员使用的语言csharp,平台当然是.net。 </p>

<p>Q：Aspxshell 如何应对不同的.net版本 </p>

<p>A：server side是兼容.net 1.1/2.0的，所以是否兼容不同版本的.net环境完全取决于客户端模块本身。 </p>

<p>Q：Aspxshell的架构是什么样的 </p>

<p>A：     Server side 和 Client side  </p>

<p>其中server side 是一个aspx文件，client side 包含一个窗体加载器和众多的插件，每个插件又包括一个本地UI，和远程程序集。 
<br/>Q：Aspxshell具有什么特色和优点？ </p>

<p>A： </p>

<p>Aspxshell结构清晰，功能是模块化，开发者可以单独为Aspxshell开发各种各样的模块，以满足独特的需求。 模块之间具有低耦合性，互不影响。同时Aspxshell的模块互相之间可以通信。 </p>

<p>Aspxshell 插件很容易开发，这得利于c#开发高效性。 </p>

<p>Aspxshell 客户端是图形化的，容易操作，内置shell数据库方便管理。 </p>

<p>Q：Aspxshell针对哪些用户？ </p>

<p>A：本项目是为安全工程师进行渗透测试以及演示脚本漏洞的危害而设计，请勿用作非法用途！本项目遵循GPLv3条款，属于开源项目，任何人可以自由复制、使用或修改本代码，本人概不承担法律责任!   </p>

<p>Q：Aspxshell实现了哪些功能？ </p>

<p>A：以下是已经实现的功能列表： </p>

<p># 获取服务端基本信息(操作系统、网络设置、存储空间、组建支持情况...); </p>

<p># 文件管理 </p>

<p># CMDshell </p>

<p># 无组件打包 </p>

<p># MS08-067远程溢出 </p>

<p># 扫描可写目录 </p>

<p># .net探针 </p>

<p># 端口转发 </p>

<p>Q：Anehta未来会怎么发展？ </p>

<p>A：我会持续开发和扩展Aspxshell，在不久的未来会完善英文文档并对外正式发布。目前计划里的蓝图如下：  </p>

<p>Client-Side： </p>

<p># LDAP查询管理 </p>

<p># DHCPserver </p>

<p># Portscan </p>

<p># PEloader （可加载C程序，而绕过执行权限） </p>

<p># Websniff Webshell下的sniff </p>

<p># 服务端代理模块 （直接利用服务端产生HTTP请求） </p>

<p># DBmanager 数据库管理 </p>

<p># XssSender 远程匿名邮件发送 </p>

<p># Remoter Proxy Sql Injection 模块（对注射的支持） </p>

<p># 注册表读取 </p>

<p># 内存驻留  服务端被删除后自动转存 </p>

<p># 进程管理 </p>

<p># 服务管理 </p>

<p># WMI模块 </p>

<p># 升级和传播模块 </p>

 summary : <p>AbstractThe excavations of the German Archaeological Institute on Elephantine Island at the southern border of Egypt aims to fully explore the settlement&#39;s history from Prehistory to the Islamic era. The data collected during the past decades of research are widespread and heterogeneous and a lot of effort is spent to collect a set of common information on the results to enable future analysis on a consistent basis.  </p>

<p>As part of this process, all published plans of the project are under way of digitisation i.e. converted into digital vector-format. Meanwhile, careful consideration has been put on questions of archiving and dissemination of the data. One basic demand is to provide central access to and the possibility of manipulating the graphical information, including the facility to download data-sets for individual mapping (e.g. plans for publication). </p>

<p>Technical StuffThe webclient is based on MapFish which itself is based on ExtJS and OpenLayers. At the moment there are two new widgets: &quot;Printing&quot; and &quot;Query&quot;.  </p>

<p>The printing widget lets you create a frame (that represents the pdf-output) on the map. You can choose the size, the orientation and the scale of the printed map. The frame is dragable on the map. </p>

<p>With the query widget it is possible to query some data, that is served by a wfs-request.</p>

<br/> Of getting to Atlantis,
<br/> You have discovered of course
<br/> Only the Ship of Fools is
<br/> Making the voyage this year..
<br/> 
<br/> - WH Auden, &#39;Atlantis&#39; </p>

<p>The Project has relocated to GitHubGo there now! </p>

<p>Version 0.8White testing lines removed. </p>

<p>Basic repair functionality added. </p>

<p>Switched to universal shell call mechanism for video playing. </p>

<p>Multi-line messages. </p>

<p>Read me first!The client was written specifically for the .NET framework and hence should work perfectly on WinXP and Vista. </p>

<p>After some tweaking and re-writing I&#39;ve got it working reasonably well on the Mono framework (if you are playing on Linux or OS/X you will need to download and install Mono - unzip to a folder and from the bash prompt &#39;mono LcogClient.exe&#39;).  The client is perfectly functional on Mono but the appearance may vary depending on specific system variables.  I&#39;ve noticed the screen drawing can be a bit slow and you may get some flickering.  Then again you may not, your mileage will vary depending on your setup. </p>

<p>The main difference between the versions is that on Windows the combat videos are directly integrated into the client.  For Linux it just does a shell call for MPlayer and on Mac a call for QuickTime.  If you would like a specific function call let me know and I can knock it up for you. </p>

<p>You will need to edit the XML config file with your factionID and password to be able to download turn reports etc. </p>

<p>Version 0.7.5Included ship images provided by Jimbo. </p>

<p>Mac build which calls Quicktime for viewing VCR&#39;s. </p>

<p>Version 0.7Damage now displayed as gradient-coloured bar. </p>

<p>Transfer form bugs fixed. </p>

<p>Build form tidied up, won&#39;t let you build past your energy store. </p>

<p>VCR&#39;s sorted in turn order and menu form shows when you have VCRS for that turn. </p>

<p>Ships now show as larger circle rather than triangle on map when orbiting a planet. </p>

<p>Version 0.6Download off-loaded on to another thread and progress now displayed due to Jim&#39;s ever growing report size. </p>

<p>Cycle buttons added to main form to enable you to cycle thro&#39; your own ship/planets. </p>

<p>Some bigger buttons added for old man Jeff. </p>

<p>Version 0.5CARE - change to .config file, ensure targetRadius is set! </p>

<p>move/intercept merged into contextual shift+left click, i prefer to previous. </p>

<p>nice big button put in for old man Jeff. </p>

<p>Version 0.4log showing if order upload is successful or not. </p>

<p>intercept order now implemented. </p>

<p>you can now move to the same position as a ship (currently crashes) instead of just planet. </p>

<p>re-jigged the build form yet again to solve linux woes – you’ll have to test. </p>

<p>key displayed on initial load of playing form – gives icon keys + command instructions. </p>

<p>uses agreed diplomacy attribute on faction node. </p>

<p>Version 0.3Started optimising the presentation code to work better under Mono in Linux and OS/X.  Hopefully fixed transfer bugs.   </p>

<p>Application now interacts with website - gets reports + uploads orders via HTTP POST!  Set your details in the config file. </p>

<p>Version 0.2Application is now re-sizeable (not entirely sure this will work in OS/X or Linux but I&#39;ve started doing a conversion in Mono which should resolve all the bugs. </p>

<p>Waypoints show, Transfers now should be fixed, distance calculations properly work with wrap-around map (better than host then;) </p>

<p>Version 0.1Lost Colonies Of Guernsey (lcog) is a Play By EMail (pbem) game.  This is a client for  the game written in C# for the .NET 2.0+ framework.  A port to mono will be forthcoming for Linux and OS/X users. </p>

<p>If the game crashes please send me the generated log file.  Please bear in mind the below todo list, your issue might be known. </p>

<p>Please feel free to make suggestions about functionality or provide images, decent icons are hard to come by. </p>

<p>NOTE:  You need to have playerfile.xml and report.xml in the same directory to run the application.  Yes I will make this nicer in 0.2;) </p>

<p>For more information, you can visit: http://www.savemyconf.com </p>

<p>What is savemyconf-client?savemyconf-client is SaveMyConf open source desktop application. </p>

<p>It is written using python and relies on Qt for its user interface. Internally, it uses FeedSync ( Microsoft extension for Atom/RSS feed synchronization, which specification is freely available here: http://dev.live.com/feedsync/spec/v1.htm ) to keep track of the installed applications. It then leverages the REST api provided by SaveMyConf to backup and reinstall your applications. </p>

<p>As a side note, if I&#39;m not mistaken, I think this the first release of an Open Source feedsync implementation for python. If I find some time, I may setup a separate project to only provide the open source feedsync implementation... so far, you&#39;ll have to grab it from savemyconf-client source code.</p>

 title : The vstream-client Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a fork off of the vstream library from the tivo-mplayer project. It has been stripped down to just the client code, and includes an example client application. If you have vserver installed on your Tivo (which most tivo hackers do), then you can use this simple client to stream .ty files from it. MPlayer will also include support for this library soon. This library can also be used by MPlayer/MEncoder to watch/re-encode tivo streams live over a network. </p>

<p>This library was originally maintained by http://armory.nicewarrior.org, but the source and resources from this site have since disappeared, and my attempts to contact the site&#39;s administrators have failed.  Therefore, I am forking the code here beginning with their last release.</p>

 title : The 4watreason Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Since its inception in 1990, feature models have been gaining an ever-growing popularity in the Software Product Line arena as a means to represent commonalities and variabilities of software families. During product engineering feature models guide the product configuration process in which stakeholders select product features. What makes feature models especially valuable is their ability to reject invalid configurations. In this context, a feature model can be seen as a constraint network.  </p>

<p>Dealing with constraints in generally a hard problem. Indeed, configuration is a well-known combinatorial problem for which optimal solutions are rarely possible. More recently, the connection between feature models and logics has raised a great deal of interest in the product line community. This connection enabled the use of off-th-shelf tools such as SAT/CSP solvers and BDD engines to reason on feature-based configuration.  However, many are the reasoning techniques each with its own goods and bads. Also, there are numerous domain-specific aspects that can help boosting particular techniques. We need means to compare such tecniques and identify when one can perform better than the other and their suitability to the domain of feature-based configuration. </p>

<p>4WATREASON is a software tool that helps analyzing and comparing different approaches to feature model reasoning. Currently, the tool incorporates a CSP-based reasoning interface and implementation (Choco), a BDD-based reasoning interface and implementation (JavaBDD), a domain-specific reasoning technique called FTRA, and hybrid combinations of such approaches. Additionally the tool allows refining particular aspects of such tecniques. For instance, BDDs are very sensitive to the ordering of their variables. The tool allows different ordering heuristics to be straightforwardly incorporated and compared with each other.  </p>

<p>Finally, 4WATREASON provides several handy APIs that allows one to quickly specify and load feature models, and use different approaches to reason on them.  </p>

<p>Other features include: </p>

<p>- Visualization of BDDs for feature models - Visualization of logic circuit for feature models - Visualization of feature-tree dependency clusters - Highly parameterized generation of random feature models with an specific number of nodes and extra constraint relations. - Conversion of feature models to CNF - and much more... </p>

 title : The agentw Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Agent World provides tools for simulating and visualizing multi-agent systems and is designed for testing machine learning applications (and specially focused on Case Based Reasoning ones). It includes support for representing information using the Feature Term formalism, and provides a series of relational machine learning algorithms that can deal with them. The whole project is created in C++, and uses OpenGL as the visualization library to ensure cross-platformness. Also, the core Feature-Term representation formalism has been reimplemented in Java (due to the implicit memory manager, the delete operation in feature terms can be performed in constant time instead of linear, and thus the whole implementation is much more efficient!). </p>

<p>In addition to the core utilities, this project also includes several test applications that I have been working on for my own research </p>

<p>The main developer is Santiago Ontañón Villar, and the work was initially developed during his Ph.D. Thesis at the IIIA-CSIC research lab in Barcelona (Spain), and has been continued since then, adding functionality and improving the code base.</p>

 summary : <p>BrainflowOverviewBrainflow is a desktop application for the visualization of functional brain imaging data.  The goal of Brainflow is to make the display of volumetric imaging data as painless and easy as possible.  Certain things, such as viewing multiple image layers, creating custom color maps, performing &#39;on the fly&#39; conjunction analyses, are not terribly well supported by existing visualization packages. Brainflow attempts to remedy this. </p>

<p>Goals of the ProjectBrainflow has relatively limited aims.  Like MRICro http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricro.html Brainflow is a visualization not an analysis tool.  Brainflow will not run statistical analyses on neuroimaging data and it will not do very much in the way of complex image processing.  Very good tools for such things exist, for instance AFNI http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/, SPM http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ and FSL http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/.  Brainflow will however, happily read in images (in standard brain imaging formats, e.g. NIFTI, Analyze, AFNI) that are created by such packages. Indeed, that is the point of Brainflow -- to visualize the results of statistical analyses carried out with other tools. </p>

<p>Cross PlatformBrainflow is written in the Java programming languange.  It should run on windows, linux, Mac and other platforms that support the Java runtime.  This will of course require that you have (the latest version, JAVA 1.6.0) installed on your computer.</p>

 title : The bt-glue Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project DeprecatedThis project was very successful, so much so that we expanded it&#39;s scope.  Bt-Glue turned into RL-Viz, a Java framework that runs on top and is compatible with RL-Glue to help visualize, debug, and experiment with reinforcement learning agents and environments. </p>

<p>Get UpdatesIf you&#39;d like to receive e-mail updates about bt-glue or ask questions, please subscribe to the bt-glue Google Groups mailing list.  The url is http://groups.google.com/group/bt-glue </p>

<p>General InfoThis library is something I&#39;m creating as part of my thesis research.  It will eventually cooperate and interface with Adam White&#39;s RL-Glue. </p>

<p>So far, the code has support for creating environments, agents, sensors, actions, and reward functions.  There are a few example projects, including: </p>

<p>GoalsThere are several libraries for reinforcement learning agents out there, so what makes this project different?  Some ideas: </p>

<p>A small, minimal (I hope) C++ based framework for creating flexible agents, environments, sensors, and actions Focus on getting a wide variety of environments, with all different types of sensors, accessible through a standardized interface so that a single agent can run on any of them, without recompiling or reconfiguring the agent. Focus in visualization of environments, value functions, etc.  (this is not novel to our project) EnvironmentsDiscrete State Grid World (agent senses the state via a unique integer label) Continuous State Grid World (agent senses the state via a pair of continuously valued variables) The previous worlds basically have the functionality of defining reward regions and soft barriers.  The agent gets -1 reward per step unless it enters a reward region, which randomly restarts the agent Acrobot problem that was used at the reinforcement learning competition at NIPS 2006 Mountain Car Skeleton World (empty environment ready to be customized by you) AgentsTabular Q(0) agent with discrete (up, down, left, right) actions Tile Coding Q(0) agent with discrete (up, down, left, right) actions Tile Coding Q(0) agent with structured/continuous actions (dx, dy) Tile Coding Sarsa Lambda - adapted from the mountain car agent in the RL-Library.  Agent is still experimental, but the internals are generic, it can be used without modification on any continuous state discrete action environment. VisualizersCocoa (OS X) based visualizer of agent running around in the grid worlds Visualize agent position and grid world topology Visualize agent value function Extensible Visualizer of agent position in Acrobot.  Working on visualizing the 4 dimensional value function. Rough visualizer of agent position and value function in mountain car, needs to be cleaned up. WANTED Someone to write a very simple QT or Java based visualizer that does the same as the Cocoa one but works cross platform  The project makes use of a library of abstract classes for agents, environments, reward functions, actions, and sensors that allow you to create generic, reusable components. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, right now the code is all for Mac OS X... and is in the form of an Xcode project.  The Xcode stuff is very physically separated from the source code though, so someone with more Unix experience can surely help create makefiles. </p>

 summary : <p>Atomic Objects is an Autonomous Inversion of Control framework for Java tm.  Simply register a set of classes and data sources and Atomic can resolve, cache and manage the entities and their relationships.  The intent is to reduce the boiler plate code and automate the programatic patterns within applications and systems. </p>

<p>In this simple example, an Airline is registered with Atomic and an Aircraft is found against it... </p>

<p>Reactor reactor = new Reactor();</p>

<p>Airline airline = new Airline();
<br/>airline.addAircraft(new Aircraft(&quot;Atomic Airlines&quot;));
<br/>reactor.addObject(airline);</p>

<p>Airline result = (Airline)reactor.find(Aircraft.class, &quot;Atomic Airlines&quot;);You can also write arbitrary interfaces which Atomic will implement at runtime. </p>

<p>Reactor reactor = new Reactor();</p>

<p>Airline airline = new Airline();
<br/>airline.addAircraft(new Aircraft(&quot;VH123&quot;));
<br/>reactor.addObject(airline);</p>

<p>FinderInterface finder = (FinderInterface)reactor.implement(FinderInterface.class);
<br/>Aircraft aircraft = finder.findVessel(&quot;VH123&quot;);This is a simple example.  The real benefit comes as the model becomes increasing complex.  In this example, a MaintenanceScheduler creates the Maintenance object through an indirect call to airline.getAircraft(). </p>

<p>Reactor reactor = new Reactor();</p>

<p>Airline airline = new Airline();
<br/>airline.addAircraft(new Aircraft(&quot;VH123&quot;));
<br/>reactor.addObject(airline);</p>

<p>reactor.addObject(new MaintenanceScheduler());</p>

<p>FinderInterface finder = (FinderInterface)reactor.implement(FinderInterface.class);
<br/>Maintenance maintenance = finder.getMaintenance(&quot;VH123&quot;);This is equivalent to.. </p>

<p>Maintenance maintenance = MaintenanceScheduler.getMaintenanceSchedule( airline.getAirline(&quot;VH123&quot;));Atomic also contains a persistence layer, called Stasis, which connects to JDBC Datasources. It automatically reflects schema information from the database and generates and manages SQL at a relational level. It is not an it is not an object-relational mapper in the same way as say Hibernate and has less of it&#39;s complexity. </p>

<p>Reactor reactor = new Reactor();</p>

<p>reactor.addClass(Airline.class);
<br/>reactor.addDatabase(new Database(&quot;jdbc/atomicairlines&quot;);</p>

<p>FinderInterface finder = (FinderInterface)reactor.implement(FinderInterface.class);
<br/>Airline airline = finder.findAirline(&quot;AA&quot;);Atomic can happily work against other POJO bases persistence models. </p>

<p>The Little MLer in F#A simple, concise, project - translate the code examples in the above book into F#. Someone (John Harrop?) recommended this as a useful book for understanding what underlies F#, and indeed, it&#39;s forced me to really think about aspects of F# that I thought I understood. The biggest payoff has been forcing me to realize that I didn&#39;t really understand generics and types, or the role of type calculus. You probably have to do your own translation to get any benefit from it, but in the spirit of &quot;if it might be useful to somebody then publish the damn thing&quot; and &quot;if I&#39;d like to be able to find it again put it in a well known location&quot; here it is.</p>

Project descriptionThis project focuses on the development of a Java software for efficient and fast 2D/3D image processing, visualization and analysis. Among current free and non-free softwares, focus on computation performance often evicts important aspects such as code readability, user-interface design, software usability or memory consumption. There are also very few softwares out there which focus also on end-users with little programming knowledge, who also wish to do things fast and efficiently, not just easily. </p>

<p>The goal of Improvis is to provide a simple yet efficient framework of tools for visualizing 2D and 3D images &amp; sequences efficiently and performing image processing and analysis tasks with only very basic programming knowledge. Image data structures are optimized for fast and repetitive pixel access (which is what image processing algorithms do 95% of the time), and plugins may seemlessly rely on native code or parallel architectures to speed-up computations. Finally, high-level analysis plugins can be created directly from the graphical interface by assembling low-level plugins together into a macro. Macros are intended to be published on a public server, allowing users to benefit from community manpower to perform efficient tasks without even touching the code. </p>

<p>Most users reading this page will probably know or want to know about the ImageJ software, which is initially based on the same ideas, and is very popular in many scientific domains. ImageJ has however evolved in so many different directions, with little care about plugin re-usability standards, and becomes everyday more difficult for new users to discover. Improvis aims at setting a new standard in program usability, starting with a homogeneous look&amp;feel for all plugins, in the way that developers will no longer have to deal with interface design, as it will be generated automatically by the software at run-time, fetching parameters and creating an intuitive and sleak interface on-the-fly. </p>

<p>DocumentationThe software itself should be simple enough not to need any user manual. However, users willing to develop their own plug-ins may want to access the API here. </p>

<p>Road MapSee the RoadMap page. </p>

<p>Feature requestAlthough the RoadMap page lists many nice things to come in the not-too-far future, I may have omitted important aspects in the development that could be useful for many. Therefore I recommend any potential user / plugin-developer to post requests in comments to that page, so that I can organize the project priorities a bit better.</p>
 summary : <p>InSTL is a free software for visualization and edition of STL files. </p>

<p>STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software. It is widely used for rapid prototyping and computer-aided manufacturing. STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three dimensional object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD model attributes. The STL format specifies both ASCII and binary representations. Binary files are more common, since they are more compact. </p>

<p>InSTL software currently supports only binary format, but might be easily extended. The software offers operations such as rotation, translation and rescale of the model. </p>

<p>It is written in Python 2.5. Visualization Toolkit VTK 5.1 is used both for visualization, interaction and volume edition. In regards to the user interface, wxPython 2.8 was used. Molecular View is multi-platform (Windows and Linux). </p>

<p>The team who developed InSTL is also responsible for the 3D Medical Reconstruction software InVesalius, which is inserted in the project Rapid Prototyping applied to Medicine (Promed), and for Molecular View, PDB file viewer.</p>

 title : The jvaf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This framework allows you to visualize your Java program in 3D virtual reality environment by just adding annotations to the code. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow developer to have a full featured 3D visualization though simple description of how it want the code to be visualized. </p>

<p>This framework consists of three parts, an Java Annotation library, Visual Element Resource library and the Framework itself. </p>

<p>The annotation library consists of several Java Annotation interface which can be used to describe how you want to map the execution of Java Code to corresponding visual representation. </p>

<p>The Visual Element Resource library contains Objects that can be put on the screen to represent the execution of underlying Java code. Those objects only contain the logic of visual representation on the screen (Example. Smile of a man, Explosion of a bomb, Firework goes off...). Those resources can be used universally regardless of the Java Code it is visualizing. </p>

<p>The Java Visualization Annotation Framework itself consists of two sub-systems. One is the Client Code Execution module, the other is the On Screen Environment Management module. The client code execution module is responsible to monitor the state change of the client code (Example. A property of a class has changed, or a function has been called) and notify the event to the On Screen Environment Management module correspondingly. The Environment Management Module will react on those event received and combined with the annotations embedded in client code will guide it to manipulate the on screen object correspondingly.  </p>

<p>Notice: This library is still in a Concept Proving Phase. Massive code / structure change will occur. </p>

 title : The lacquis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The aim of the project is to carry out the simulation of the process of learning the semantic of language of a population. It is assumed that environment consists of a given, finite set of object that can be described by a certain state of attributes. These informations are taken from environment by the group of sensors represented in the system by low level Object Agents and then discused by Population Agents. New Agent appears in the area of population and on the way of communication with the agents of population (receiving communicates about environment formulated in global language) is to get to know the semantic of this language.</p>

 title : The magic-table Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Magic Table     </p>

<p>By Dr Greg Ross </p>

<p>See more of your data at a glanceThe Magic Table is a JavaScript library that allows you to see more in your data by applying some simple visual techniques to transform a table. </p>

<p>Information VisualisationThe examples show how you can obtain a barchart or scatterplot view in the table as well as a novel approach to displaying a lot more of your data without using up  much valuable screen real estate. The latter technique has adopted the concept of spatial distortion, using a fisheye lens model. Reducing the row height and column widths so that all of the cells become visible and using colour to encode the cell values affords the user an informative overview of all the data in one go. By moving a lens over this overview we can magnify the cells under the lens so that we obtain detail within the overview. </p>

<p>Google visualisation APIThe library has now also been wrapped in Google&#39;s visualisation API. Here&#39;s an example of how to use it this way. </p>

<p>Easy to useDownload or checkout the code and follow the walk-through or the example web pages to quickly create a magic table. </p>

<p>BrowsersThe library has been tested in Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome. It&#39;s super-fast in Safari. However, since it uses the canvas element, it does not work in Interner Explorer (boooooooooooooo!). I tried to get it to work with ExplorerCanvas but IE is stupendously slow when it comes to VML path rendering. In fact, Internet Snorer is around 10 orders of magnitude slower than Safari! Alas, I decided not to continue my effort in making it compatible with IE. Instead, it is intended that the library is used in applications that have, wisely, embedded a non-IE browser engine such as Gecko or Presto. </p>

 summary : <p>This project is build using Processing. The goal is to provide an easy framework that anyone can create powerful custom visualization for their own performances. By using Processing, I hope to make this project easily amended. Also, I plan to make this project compatible with Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Visualizations will not only display basic MIDI events as well as frequency domain signals, it will produce visuals based on harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic analysis of music. For example, MIDI data will be analyzed to determine a tonal center (key) or which chord is implied by that data as well as time signatures, etc. Midulizer.</p>

 summary : <p>AbstractWe present NetGrok, a new tool for visualizing computer networks in real-time. NetGrok applies well-known information visualization techniques (overview, zoom &amp; filter, details on demand) and employs a group-based graph layout and a treemap to visually organize network data. NetGrok also integrates these tools with a shared data store that can read PCAP formatted network captures, capture traces from a live interface, and filter the data set dynamically by bandwidth, number of connections, and time.  </p>

<p>We performed a user case study that demonstrates the benefits of applying these techniques to static and real-time streaming packet data. Specifically, NetGrok serves as an &quot;excellent real-time diagnostic,&quot; enabling fast understanding of network traffic and easy problem detection. </p>

<p>Why?1.1: Add to that basic idea - that let&#39;s think (or imagine) that we will make positive shift and transition towards &#39;more saving&#39; American way of living. Then that should be trackable...thus the idea for this (desktop/portal)widget! </p>

<p>Problem/Obstacle1. Now in mid-late November 2008, American and global economy is basically in catastrophic fall, and there are many structural issues and much more nuanced coordination will take place to first get out of this downward spiral. In that, simplistic representation of &#39;saving and spending&#39; will not be really possible or meaningful, nor helpful.  </p>

<p>Problem/Obstacle1. But in the end, in say 3 years, America cannot recover based on &#39;depending on spending&#39;. It can&#39;t. It can&#39;t recover based on spending based on (foreign) borrowing or credit or debt. So there is first complication but we need to keep focus on this simple goal of &#39;we got to save more&#39;. This meter is just a meter. And around it we aim to create meaningful stuff - to help, steer American household out of decades-old, built-up habit of spending and borrowing, and making it landing on &#39;sound and secure saving&#39; - and we will see what&#39;s necessary and what has to happen to make that happen.  </p>

<p>Aim: Meter, and more comprehensive understanding and sense of economy, household, among American people (and international audience, etc.) Screens of PC, Web contents, need to help transforming American people&#39;s economic habits, sophistication and culture.  </p>

<p>November 21, 2008    </p>

<p>Next Steps </p>

<p>Thing is Intuit (TurboTax, Quicken) company may have... interest or similar tool already?(Software to help &#39;Saving&#39; is there. but...) Check it is technically (already) how much possible or not. How much of (meaningful, usable, relevant) statistic numbers (indexes) are available - or not - on the Web. And how that can be modeled with what language. Canvas? SVG? ML? (What&#39;s used normally on those stock charts etc) Make some visual mock.  List relevant experts. Relevant and those who might be helpful on this idea.  List orgs, agencies who might be helpful on this idea.  Formulate, prepare meaningful initial contact packet. (or can be approached in more light-weight way?) Post to...programmers forum etc? Local meeting in NYC area? (Drupal?) and see how it goes?... --- </p>

<p>Pie chart visualization tool to check and track positive (and negative) spending (and saving etc) pattern change in (average, etc) American household budgeting and finance (or lack of them) quarterly, half-yearly, etc. </p>

<p>This post is to mark its launching date with Nov 4th 2008 – the day probably Barack Obama will become the 44th American president.  </p>

<p>Basic purpose, possible variations, applications of the idea/inspiration will soon follow.</p>

 summary : <p>OpenVP is a free and open-source platform for developing music visualizations, written in C# and developed primarily on Linux.  The Tao Framework OpenGL bindings are used for effect rendering. </p>

<p>The high-level goal of OpenVP is to develop a platform-neutral, media-player-neutral framework for developing music visualizations.  The framework should impose as few restrictions on creativity as possible while also providing a base that makes this flexibility easy to consume. </p>

<p>The core framework is suitable for: </p>

<p>Embedding into another application. Extending by creating new standalone effects. Extending by creating new presets that react to specific songs in specific ways. In particular, the mechanism used to obtain PCM and frequency spectrum data (as well as song metadata like title and current playback position) is left up to the embedding application in the form of an abstract base class.  Further support is available for providing custom beat detection systems to the framework. </p>

<p>The GTK+ user interface in the project can, in its current form, be used to rapidly create new visualization presets and to test new effects.  It uses the reflection capabilities of the CLI to discover new effect types and generate property sheets with little developer effort.  Eventually it will turn into a complete visualization studio, allowing the development of presets containing keybindings and custom switchboards, and hopefully time-scripted visualization. </p>

<p>Some of the core effects use a custom compiler written specifically for this project to allow users to alter the behavior of effects without requiring them to create new effect assemblies.  The casual user may be able to pick up on a simple scripting language quickly but is unlikely to know C# or even have a development environment handy.  Eventually I would like to move away from this custom compiler to something a bit more standardized, but no compiler currently exists for the CLR that is capable of generating garbage-collectible methods.</p>

 summary : <p>Update: 9/4/08So with the research coming to a close I thought I would post up the conclusions.  Basically, the final decision was to develop a converter to KML and provide customizations for it.  The decision was made shortly after the last meeting for a few reasons.  The first reason was that Google Earth&#39;s KML language supported the right types of animations that we would need to do.  The second reason is that we decided that Excel&#39;s statistics engine was far better than anything we could come up with.  That being said, all statistical analysis can be done through Excel and then uploaded and converted to KML.  Currently, the Importer supports importing from an XML data file and an Excel converter will be posted in a day or two. </p>

<p>Update: 6/25/08Last Week I added a team member, Henry.  He will be working on a lot of the statistics functionality of this project.   </p>

<p>Over the past few days I started working on a way to animate frames in place in an HTML document using javascript.  The use of this would be to slightly modify the library to work with Google Maps Overlays in order to animate Google Maps in place over time.  Example code for this library as well as the source code is available under Downloads. </p>

<p>Next I&#39;ll be working on a module for drawing the types of overlays that I would need for animating these maps as well as a module for graphically displaying the statistics. </p>

<p>Update: 6/12/08Preliminary Schedule: </p>

<p>6/13/08: </p>

<p>Progress on the statistics and prediction modules Begin work on a module to calculate gradients and other advanced color work Research on which statistics methods would work the best for my purposes Minor improvements on the data import script </p>

<p>8/17/2008: </p>

<p>Finish up everything Final debugging </p>

<p>Update: 6/6/08This past week not much was changed in terms of the actual look and functionality of the application, however I&#39;ve been working on other code that will make future additions to the program much easier.  Currently I&#39;m working on: </p>

<p>PHP Class (Calc.php) to calculate trendlines and predict future data values Improving the accuracy and intelligence of the data import script Interface for utilizing the above class to manipulate data and adjust and predict   values Animating activity over time The core of the statistical analysis of the project lies in the Calc.php file, as it will contain all methods of calculating values based on the dataset given.  In order for this to properly function, the import script must be improved.  Currently, the project supports importing data in the form of: </p>

<p>locationtime period 1time period 2time period 3... Michigandata valuedata valuedata value... </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to improve the script enough such that common methods of data formatting are easily parsed out and stored for future manipulation.  The import script will also go through several different parsing schemes to try to match the file.  This allows for a very flexible and intelligent upload.  The script will also keep track of past schemes in case you use the same one in the future.  By next week I hope to have made significant progress on the Calc.php class and improving the data import script. </p>

<p>Update: 5/30/08Over the past week I&#39;ve been working on getting a sample application done.  The program can map a location with a certain variable over any given number of time periods.  The example application has been populated with date from the 2004 electoral votes, the overall high temperature recorded in each state, and the record high temperature in the southeast states for each month.  </p>

<p>The application also includes the ability to customize the color schemes of the markers as well as at what threshold each data point appears.  Each dataset can also be customized to its own unique center point and zoom level. </p>

<p>Example code will be available shortly.</p>

 summary : <p>SNAVI: Desktop Application for Analysis and Visualization of Large-Scale Cell Signaling NetworksAbstractStudies of cellular signaling indicate that signal transduction pathways combine to form large networks of interactions. Viewing protein-protein and ligand-protein interactions as graphs (networks), where biomolecules are represented as nodes and their interactions are represented as links, is a promising approach for integrating experimental results from different sources to achieve a systematic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cell phenotype. The emergence of large-scale signaling networks provides an opportunity for topological statistical analysis. However, visualization of such networks represents a challenge.  SNAVI (Signaling Networks Analysis and Visualization) is Windows-based desktop application that implements standard network analysis methods to compute the clustering, connectivity distribution, and detection of network motifs, as well as provides means to visualize networks and network motifs. SNAVI is capable of generating linked web pages from network datasets loaded in text format. SNAVI can also create networks from lists of gene or protein names.  SNAVI is a useful tool for analyzing, visualizing and sharing cell signaling data. SNAVI is open source free software.  </p>

 title : The trie-rules Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A project to create tools to support the creation of correct rule bases on top of rdf triple stores.  </p>

<p>The project is still in an early stage, but you can download and try an innovative graphical debugger for rules - it works but is limited to RDF files without anonymous nodes and rules without functors or built-ins. Rule cycles will crash it.  </p>

<p>Over time the project will grow to include a bit of formal verification, visualization and some automatic debugging support.  </p>

<p>The project is created in Java, is build on top of Eclipse and utilizes the Jena framework. </p>

<p>We love to hear from you, in particular if you need debugging/verification tool for rules on top of RDF! Further development of this project will largely depend on whether people need such a thing! Related news and publications will be published on this Blog here.</p>
 title : The triplipse Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Triplipse is a visualization tool for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) within Eclipse. It provides two views of the RDF Graph: one as a simple, sortable table of the Statements, and one as a tree instead of the typical bubble-graph. Triplipse accepts RDF+XML and Turtle formats, and is designed to be easily extended to provide more formats in the future. The primary goal of Triplipse is to provide developers with an easy-to-use visualization tool for a large RDF Document without having to scroll through pages and pages of RDF text and without having to scroll through screens and screens of  hard to read and hard to connect images. </p>

<p>Project InformationAs the Semantic Web developed very fast in recent years, the need for sharing knowledge about a given resource, based solely on the URI denoting that resource, becomes critical to achieving a fully open, global, scalable, and ubiquitous Semantic Web. Tupelo is a well defined uniform protocol for managing data and semantic (RDF) metadata in such way. </p>

<p>What is currently lacking is a desktop client that would allow browsing through Tupelo. Such a client would connect with one or more servers and display data organized by metadata, using tables, trees, graphs. This client should also be able to connect to various data sources. </p>

<p>This project will be implemented in Adobe AIR , making it possible to support different operating system. Additionally, I will write a common library in Action Script 3.0, which provides some basic components for similar application. This lib can be used to implement new Flash or Flex application based on Tupelo, which might be embeded in user&#39;s browser. </p>

 title : The vishis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Visualize History aims to provide a new way of presenting and understanding history. The application will provide an intuitive, interactive way to navigate the complex relationships within history. </p>

<p>Historical events are often restricted to the pages of books, newspapers and magazines, and from a very young age, people learn to approach history only textually. When images are used, they often supplement or summarize the prose; only rarely does visual data stand on its own. Yet no intrinsic property of the historical data enforces the convention that words should trump images. In fact, much of history is naturally presented visually. Any interesting history will consist of various parts, interlinked and roughly ordered. Students must reconstruct the multi-dimensional story from the linear prose they read in order to understand the complete picture. </p>

<p>Visualize History will attack the general problem by presenting that multi-dimensional story in multiple dimensions. For example, many key events are directly linked to a specific geographic location and all are linked to a specific time or time period. The application will therefore provide a way to navigate through both time and space. However, the logical relationships are just as important as the temporal or spatial ones, and the application will also provide a way to navigate from an event to other related events.</p>

 title : The visualgorithm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project consists in creating a visualization tool for algorithmic teaching and more particularly for students. In its first version, the software will only include algorithms on binary trees but other data structures will be added. </p>

<p>This software provides an algorithm player. This player allows users to visualize the modifications due to algorithms on data structures on which they are applied. Thus, users can understand algorithms at their own pace thanks to different controls like pause, next, previous, etc. Furthermore, algorithm modifications are translated into animations and users can change the details of the animations and the speed of the algorithm trace. </p>

<p>Before applying an algorithm, users have to make the data structure on which they want to apply the algorithm. Two modes are possible for this creation. The first is a quick mode without any help. The second is a pedagogic mode where the user have to create the data structure by his own : the software just give tips and also the solution if the user does not know it (for example, on which node make a rotation to balance an AVL tree).</p>

 title : The yaxx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XML stands for eXensible Markup Language. YAXX is an XML extension to YACC, which stands for &#39;Yet Another Compiler-Compiler&#39;. This extension allows a program in a YACC grammar (LALR) to be automatically converted into an XML document that encodes the syntax tree of the program. Moreover, the generated XML document can be validated by a generated DTD (Document Type Description) document. The resulting syntax tree in XML can also be transformed back into the original program through a very simple XSLT stylesheet. The implementation of YAXX is based on an extension to Bison, a public-domain implementation of YACC. The software collects a number of YACC grammars and reference parsers to support the parsing of all major programming languages, including ANSI C, Fortran 77, GNU C++, Java, C#, Ada 95, PHP5, XML, SQL, etc. The original hosting site of the project in SourceForge is still functioning for the release of the tarballs.

Obviously this will only be of even the remotest interest to you if you live in Canberra, Australia, and are interested in buying a house. </p>

<p>For now, I&#39;m just using it with NetNewsWire&#39;s script subscription option. It could probably be deployed on a web server pretty simply, but the all homes guys might get a bit touchy if too much traffic starts coming from one place. I suppose you could just have the script dump it&#39;s output for each URL you&#39;re interested in to a static file every hour or something. </p>

<p>The target audience is primarily developers interested in further exploration of the Android SDK.  Source code is available, and can be accessed through the Subversion repository hosted here. </p>

<p>Screenshots    </p>

<p>To-DoThere are a number of issues left unresolved with the project currently: </p>

<p>There is a background service in place to handle synchronization of channels on an ideally configurable interval.  Unfortunately, I have not found a graceful way to report status back to the main UI to display the synchronization progress on a per-channel basis so that users may see which channels are currently refreshing.  Not a necessary component for the final product, but it&#39;s something I&#39;d like to figure out before I enable the service. UPDATE: See my Asynchronous Service Example for an example of how this could be done. </p>

<p>Rewrite RSSChannelRefresh using a more flexible, generalized approach.  This was written quick-and-dirty just to get data for testing, and now desperately needs to be revisited. I am not confident that I have correctly implemented onFreeze, onPause, and onResume in some of my activities. Unit testing. Google needs to fix some of their bugs too :)</p>

<br/>源代码请用svn签出有错误告知我Email:toozoofoo@gmail.com GTalk:toozoofoo@gmail.com 直接在wiki上写出来 将要实现的功能用户之间可以通信，分享RSS频道 更新RSS Client核心类库的自动更新已实现 现在Windows用户只用双击run.exe或run.bat文件即可。 更新现在类库与核心代码包分开来，类库又分为第一依赖类库和第二依赖类库，它们分别是jre包和第三方开源依赖包，核心代码包是指RSS_Client.jar文件，它才是真正经过自己编码得到的。这样分开有以下几个好处： 
<br/>由于jre基本上不用变化太多，故只需下载一次:For Linux,For Windows，避免了重复下载大件文件。 第三方类库可能会有变化，可是经常单独下载小件文件也不是什么负担。 RSS_Client.jar这个核心包是经常变化，可文件尺寸它最小，更新时如果不需要依赖其他类库，只用下载它替代以前的RSS_Client.jar文件即可，上面两个文件不用重新下载，如果需要用到额外的类库，那么重新下载第三方类库。 安装指导http://code.google.com/p/rssr-eader/wiki/GuideToUse</p>

 title : The telligent-rss-net Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds. It provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds. It is fully compatible with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1. </p>

<p>Based on the original RSS.NET open source project on Source Forge, with some improvements and bug fixes made by Telligent. </p>

<p>HistoryThe RSS.NET Source Forge project was created on January 22, 2003. A stable release was never published, however a source code drop described as a &quot;Nightly TAR containing current source&quot; was released on the project web site, with the open-source MIT license. It was written in C#. The original RSS.NET project on Source Forge was abandoned and no further releases have been published. </p>

<p>While working on Community Server 2.0 in 2005, the developers at Telligent needed a feed parsing component that would work in ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0. We used the source code from the RSS.NET Source Forge project as a base and have gradually made bug fixes and small improvements when necessary over the past couple years. These custom RSS.NET builds were used in Community Server 2.0 - 2008, and in the current Telligent Evolution platform. </p>

<p>Several customers have asked for the source code to be made available, so Telligent decided to move its custom RSS.NET project from an internal SVN server to this Google Code project. Now it is freely available for anyone to use.</p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionWordpress RSS Combiner is a Wordpress-Plugin that lets you merge several RSS-Feeds into one. It caches the input feeds, sorts items by publishing-date and then outputs a feed in either RSS 2.0  or Atom 1.0 format. Currently it requires WordPress 2.1x (in case downgradeability could be added on request) Version-HistoryApologizes for not maintaining this over the last 1.5 yrs. As I have use for this again, I&#39;ll fix things, here. v1.0c RC - still Release Candidate (minor improvements to admin-page - Rev78) (2007/11/28) v1.0 RC - first Release Candidate (for testing only - in order to get some feedback - Rev70) (2007/11/26) Project Start. No official Releases yet. (2007/11/24)  InstallationDownload the archive and extract its contents or checkout the source (http://wp-rss-combiner.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/). Upload the complete folder (including subfolders) to /wp-content/plugins/ of your Wordpress-Installation. Activate the plugin. Make sure to change the write-properties (chmod) of /wp-content/plugins/wp-rss-combiner/simplepie/cache to 0777 (Simplepie will cache the feed there). Add the feeds you want to combine (Simply add the exact URL of a feed under &#39;Options&#39; - &#39;RSS Combiner&#39;). Screenshots1. Customize Settings(enlarge)  </p>

 title : The afgen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AFGEN is a midterm university project from the &quot;Compilers Design&quot; class of Computers Engeneering career at the Politecnic Faculty of the National University of Asuncion, Paraguay.  </p>

<p>The idea is to create a Regular Expression converter to the equivalent Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), following the Thompson Algorithm and using a Syntax-Directed Translation engine of one pass.  </p>

<p>With the NFA, we use the Subset Construction algorithm to obtain the corresponding DFA, which is then minimized to finally get the Reduced DFA.  </p>

<p>The Reduced DFA is used to simulate a String Validation process that validate if an input string belong to the language defined by the original Regular Expression.  </p>

<p>Project GoalThe goal of afgen is to generate the Finite Automaton (non-deterministic, deterministic and minimum) for a regular expression, and then use this to validate input strings.</p>
 title : The alfps Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Just a project to host this code.  I&#39;m not sure exactly where this is going.  All code in namespace alfs.  I&#39;d name the project alfs except that name is already in use at SourgeForge. </p>

<p>C++0x emulation: shared_ptr stuff (from Boost), static_assert macro, type_traits stuff (from Boost) and unique_ptr emulation (Howard Hinnant).  The unique_ptr emulation turned out to be a bit fragile with MSVC 7.1 so I didn&#39;t place it in namespace std. </p>

<p>Two smart pointers by me: CheckingPtr, which throws on access of nullpointer and more importantly supports being set to null automatically when the referent object is destroyed (e.g. window object self-destroying), and AutoNewPtr, which wraps CheckingPtr and forwards constructor arguments and automatically add destruction notification ability to the pointee, if it&#39;s lacking.  This is primarily in support of GUI and file system functionality. </p>

<p>To come: parts owning smart pointer.  Will support pointing to a part of an object or array, with ref counting of the full object.  This is in support of ref strings. </p>

<p>To come: Ref strings.  Extremely efficient strings that act much like Java and C# strings, conceptually as pointers to read only content.  Supports constant time for many operations, including building a string from literal.  I&#39;m transferring the code here from SourceForge project (Alf&#39;s StringValue) because the SF project was limited to just the string class. </p>

<p>To come: GUI stuff.  Going further with ideas from my old Screensaver Manager, that a C++ object (e.g. representing a window) should be valid after construction.  Single-phase construction.  Possibly further development, to do serialization in the same way (that&#39;s a hard problem :-)).  Also various utility such as e.g. simple use of Automation objects from C++.</p>

 title : The bitwise-enum Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: This library now is part of the MiLi Minimalistic Library. Download it from there.OBSOLETE </p>

<p>A very simple, 0-overhead, and yet type-safe 1-file library for doing bitwise operations between masks represented by enums. </p>

<p>For example, given: </p>

<p>enum ClearBufferMask
<br/>{
<br/>    GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT    = 0x00000100,
<br/>    GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT    = 0x00000200,
<br/>    GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT  = 0x00000400,
<br/>    GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT    = 0x00004000,
<br/>};</p>

<p>void glClear(unsigned int mask);the problem is that any bitwise operation between ClearBufferMask elements will loose the type, and will be casted to int. Thus, type-checking will be disabled, and glClear() can be called with any integer value. </p>

<p>bitwise_enum class wrapper just provides all the bitwise operations over a given enum (as a template parameter), always keeping the type. Given that, glClear can now be declared as: </p>

<p>void glClear( bitwise_enum mask );`</p>

<p>int main()
<br/>{
<br/>   glClear( GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT | GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );   // OK
<br/>   glClear( 0x00004000 | 0x00000100); // ERROR!
<br/>}Just include bitwise_enums.hpp and you are ready to use it. </p>

 title : The buildpy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>build.py is a build automation tool, similar to GNU Make, Jam and others. It&#39;s, however, aimed at small projects, which don&#39;t need complexity and robustness of the above ones. build.py follows the KISS principle - you can learn in in the matter of minutes! Generally, build.py is designed to be easy as much as it&#39;s possible, thus providing fast learning curve.  </p>

<p>build.py is written in Python - mature, multi-paradigm programming language. For those who know it - you do not need to learn Yet Another Scripting Language, as you would with Make or CMake - you can use your experience to shape build.py into your needs. If you don&#39;t program in Python, don&#39;t worry - it&#39;s probably one of the easiest (yet it&#39;s really powerful) languages to learn! </p>

<p>Planned features of build.py: </p>

<p>Automated building, installation, cleaning, removing, compressed package creating Cross-platform GUI interface for end-users Support for various compilers Easy and straightforward learning curve Comprehensive documentation build.py consists of one (!) file, so you can redistribute it along your package - no additional dependencies!  (to be extended) </p>

<p>Actually, build.py is in intense development. You can check it out from SVN (see &#39;Sources&#39; section). Current trunk also provides all necessary documentation. </p>

 title : The cambbs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BBS, I mean the black terminal interface, was quite popular among students and young professionals in those good old days. Although it is being replaced by more eye-catching web interfaced forums and blogs, it is still used and favoured by some old dogs. </p>

<p>The old BBS code was written in ANSI C code which is hard to maintain, debug or get compiled on nowadays compilers; File based information management has lagged far behind the mordern database deployment. Simple C-CGI web interface could no longer satisfy the increasing requirements for new generations. </p>

<p>Therefore, we must do something to revive the past glory. C++ and STL are used to improve code integrity and efficiency; MySQL and MySQL++ are adopted to host not only texts, but also images, audios and videos, etc. to give users a feature-rich experience as they&#39;ve enjoyed elsewhere; the web interface will be written in PHP.</p>
 title : The catatonic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MotivationIn earlier years I wrote some code to simulate polynomial (sum of products), lazy datatypes in C++ right on the tracks of the Hutton &amp; Meijer paper &#39;Bananas in Space&#39;. Required some advanced hacking and metaprogramming. Some other bits will go in too. Let&#39;s see if I can get this in shape and how the modern compilers deal with these things. </p>

<p>GCC v4.3 added a C++0x feature: variadic templates. There is a new kid on the block: Clang is expected to show solid C++ somewhere in 2010. Concepts may pave the path so some early error checkin of fixpoints etc. StatusThe project name refers to the current state of this code, but in the future this may become a tonic of cata :-) Silly, I know. </p>

<p>Background, AnecdotalMost of this code was developed on the Metrowerks CodeWarrior system, and the complicated template instantiations triggered dozens of bugs in their compiler. So I ended up with filing obscure template bug reports to MW on a daily basis. When a colleague met a MW support engineer at WWDC mentioning my name, the engineer responded: &quot;Yeah, we know that guy, we just refer to him as Gabor Grief!&quot; To their defense, I have to state, that bugs nonwithstanding, CodeWarrior was probably the best compiler of its time (around 1997) when it came to supporting template features.</p>

<p>Description of the code Celeste 3DKinetic plasma simulation typically requires to handle a multiplicity of space and time scales. The implicit moment particle in cell PIC method provides a possible route to address the presence of multiple scales effectively. Here, a new implementation of the implicit moment method is implemented in the code: CELESTE3D code, a fully electromagnetic and fully kinetic PIC code, based on the implicit moment method. The code has been in use for a number of years. A number of input files for different benchmarks of CELESTE3D are included to show the typical application. </p>

Currently, the CompilerVision has tools that visualize specific data structures used in compiler development like control flow graphs, dominator trees, dominance frontiers and SSA intermediate forms. Future versions of CompilerVision will have the following features: </p>

<p>1. Translation from any popular high-level languages like C, C++, Java or C++ to optimized assembly instructions for both CISC or RISC architectures like x86, ARM or MIPS (both CISC and RISC) </p>

<p>2. Virutal machines for architectures like ARM or MIPS. </p>

<p>3. Code optimizations based on various code improvement algorithms like loop optimizations, hoisting, aggressive dead code elimination, constant folding, copy propagation and pipelining and scheduling.</p>

 title : The cpsh Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This tool works with common C++ compilers (such as GCC and VC 7.1) to leverage C++ constructs for scripts. It is simply beyond my grasp that one needs &#39;special script&#39; languages, like Perl, in order to do &#39;small&#39; tasks. </p>

<p>More info is found at http://blog.davber.com. </p>

<p>Release information is found at CpshVersion1. </p>

<p>Sample SessionsI.e., one can have this shell file, that goes over all files in a given directory and prints out the big ones: </p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/cpsh
<br/>path topPath = argv[1]
<br/>remove_copy_if (
<br/>  directory_iterator(topPath),
<br/>  directory_iterator(),
<br/>  bind(less, bind(file_size,_1), 10000000L),
<br/>  ostream_iterator(cout, &#39;\n&#39;));Using ordinary C++ (with the Boost library accessible directly, such as the &#39;path&#39; type in the filesystem sub namespace) </p>

<p>It also comes with an interactive shell, via the &#39;-i&#39; option, enabling sessions as (the text following &#39;&gt;&#39; is what the user types): </p>

<p>&gt; vector names;
<br/>&gt; ? sizeof names
<br/>&lt; 20
<br/>&gt; ? names.size()
<br/>&lt; 0
<br/>&gt; const char* texts[] = { &#39;John&#39;, &#39;Greg&#39;, &#39;Bob&#39; };
<br/>&gt; copy (texts, texts+3, insert_iterator(names));
<br/>&gt; ? names.size();
<br/>&lt; 3
<br/>&gt; transform (names.begin(), names.end(), \
<br/>&gt;&gt;  bind(substr, _1, 1), \
<br/>&gt;&gt;  ostream_iterator(cout, &#39; &#39;));
<br/>{ohn reg ob } This is perfect for learning the language or verifying one&#39;s knowledge about complicated constructs. </p>

<p>So, why learn a new scripting language when all the power you need is available in C++, at least as succinctly expressed as with any other language. Oh, did I forget to mention that C++ executables are a bit faster than interpreted Ruby :-)</p>

 title : The csdms-cca Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Our science community should work together and create a unified, predictive science of  surface processes through the development of a Community Surface-Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS).  CSDMS is a digital library of inter-connectable process modules able to  predict the transport and accumulation of sediment and solutes in landscapes and  seascapes, and how these surfaces evolve over a broad range of time and space scales.  CSDMS is a complete Sediment Modeling Environment.  CSDMS includes the protocols for  community-generated, continuously evolving, distributed, open software. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To this end, the CSDMS project has chosen to use the Common Component Architecture (CCA) to aid in the creation and linking of model components, and the building of a language-neutral library of models for the community (c, c++, F77, F9x, java, and python).  This website houses the latest developments of the CSDMS efforts using CCA.</p>

 title : The garmintools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This software provides Linux users with the ability to communicate with the Garmin Forerunner 305 via the USB interface.  While this is the only Garmin unit that I own, I did implement all of the documented Garmin protocols as of Rev C (May 19, 2006) over the USB physical link.  This means that if you have a Garmin with a USB connection to a PC, you ought to be able to use this software to communicate with it. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a complete solution to all of your Linux Garmin GPS needs, this is not it.  I own a Garmin Forerunner 305 and wrote this code specifically so I could download and save data from that particular GPS unit to my Linux machine.  I tried gpsbabel, but found that it did not have command line options specific to the Forerunner run and lap data - all I could do was get the tracklog.  That&#39;s how all of this got started.  I also wanted a few other things, like the ability to convert a track log into a Google maps encoded polyline, and (eventually) the ability to generate PNG images of heart rate and elevation data.</p>

 title : The geoid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GeoidWe would like to announce an open source geological modelling program Geoid. It&#39;s main purpose is creating geological models of oil reservoirs. Compared to its main proprietary analogs it will be available under Lesser General Public License, which means that it&#39;s free for everyone and also with source code provided. For more details please read the GNU General Public License . Currently it is at the very early stage of development, with only few features implemented. I am the only developer at the moment, but open source development model&#39;s main goal is that every volunteer can help in improvement of the software. </p>

<p>If you are a developer, wishing to contribute to Geoid, you have to be familiar with technologies, we use. Geoid is written in C++ programming language. For 3D graphics we are using Opengl, and for user interface - Qt framework. Why particular this set of technologies? The first benefit is that they are fully cross-platform, so there&#39;s no need to modify program&#39;s code to make it available under main three platforms - UNIX, Windows and Mac OS. Qt is one of the best(and in my opinion the best) framework for graphic user interface software. So if you are good at least at C++ and geological modelling - we are pleased to invite you to the development team! </p>

<p>We also need somebody, who can draw nice icons, because right now it doesn&#39;t have any. The problem is that popular icon libraries like oxygen or tango doesn&#39;t have anything to do with petroleum geology :) </p>

<p>If you have questions of any kind we can discuss them in the Geiod&#39;s Google Group</p>

 title : The gldemotool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Based entirely on cross-platform APIs, this tool can be used to create OpenGL scenes ranging from a simple triangle all the way up to an advanced multi-pass shader. It automatically scales the rendering code based on the scene, so a simple scene can still be run on older hardware, even though the application supports much more powerful features. </p>

<p>All the data is XML-based - with an assumed default of &#39;off&#39; for most features - so you don&#39;t have to turn everything off manually. The XML format scales along with the graphics engine, allowing scene writers to define exactly how data is mapped to shaders, whether shadows are created, and even certain portions of the OpenGL state.</p>

 title : The google-summer-of-code-2007-scons Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WARNING This &quot;project&quot; is only for students&#39; code from GSoC 2007 and is not actually used by the SCons project itself.  For ths SCons project, see the home page, the project page, the wiki, or the issues instead of the pages here. </p>

<p>SCons is a cross-platform, next-generation build tool. Unlike most other build tools that invent their own mini-language or wedge a scripting language onto some other configuration file syntax, SCons configuration files are actually Python scripts. The flexibility of Python scripting makes it possible to solve complicated build problems in surprisingly small amounts of maintainable code. Its portability (the only requirement is Python 1.5.2 or later), cross-platform features (extensive support for languages and compilers), and reliability (MD5 file signatures, cache) make it an incomparable tool for build masters in particular, and also for many free software projects. </p>

<p>SCons has been an active project since its founding in 2001.  SCons now averages about 7000 downloads per month and has active user and development mailing lists with membership of approximately 450 and 150, respectively, and average monthly traffic of 275 and 100 messages, respectively. </p>

<p>The SCons Foundation was organized in 2003 to hold the copyrights of the SCons source code, and to provide a legal entity for any other organizational necessities (e.g., receiving donations). The Foundation is a Delaware non-profit corporation, but does not currently have 501(c)(3) status.</p>

 title : The hannibalcodegenerator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&quot;We will either find a way, or make one.&quot; - Hannibal Barca </p>

<p>Hannibal Barca, the great Carthaginian general, is widely regarded as the greatest strategist and tactician of all time. His ability to engage the enemy, using innovative yet simple tactics in such a way as to ensure victory is second to none. Hannibal the code generator, strives to emulate Hannibal Barca&#39;s embodiment of minimalism, simplicity, and efficiency to advance pragmatic solutions to solve the problems associated with rapid web application development. </p>

<p>Hannibal is much more than a code generator. It is a code generator that produces code that is tied to small but effective Hannibal packages that allow developers to efficiently tackle a finite but commonly encountered set of problems. Hannibal is written in Java, but generates code in Java, JavaScript, php, and SQL. We plan to have Hannibal generate code in other languages as well. </p>

<p>We wanted to solve common problems encountered in web application development, without burdening the developer with the need to understand yet another tool set. Hannibal&#39;s supporting packages for Java and php merely support. When using Hannibal, it is our goal that the developer can quickly start creating code that works, and use and extend that generated code to build more interesting web applications. Here is a list of the common problems we are attempting to solve with Hannibal. </p>

<p>Persistence. URI templating and processing. Search Validation Presentation Authorization Audit Internationalization If we can make these things easier, we can claim success. </p>

<p>To meet this goal, here are some of the guidelines we developed over time to help of maintain focus: </p>

<p>Ruthlessly minimize Hannibal&#39;s technology set dependencies. Rely on the target programming language built-in capabilities as much as possible. Only when necessary use open source third party software libraries. Keep the amount of Hannibal specific code to a minimum. Cater to popular open source tools for creating web based applications, such as Tomcat, and MySQL. Encourage integration with modern programming platforms like Amazon Web Services. Whenever possible choose the target programming language to be used as a configuration language over other more popular choices like property files or XML. We will try very hard to keep these promises to ourselves.</p>

 title : The k-shortest-paths Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The description of the original algorithm could be found in the paper, &#39;A New Implementation Of Yen&#39;s Ranking Loopless Paths Algorithm&#39; (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/martins00new.html). </p>

<p>IntroductionYen’s algorithm is one of derivation algorithms for ranking the K shortest paths between a pair of nodes 1. It always searches the shortest paths in a “pseudo”-tree containing K shortest loopless paths. The very shortest one is obtained in the first place, and the second shortest path is always explored on the basis of the shortest paths that are shorter. In our paper, we exploit the implementation of Yen’s algorithm in 1. Compared with the straightforward implementation of Yen’s algorithm, the one present in 1 is proved to have a better performance in computational experiments, although the complexity of them are the same, O(Kn(m+nlogn)) in the worst case analysis. </p>

<p>ImplementationC++ language is used to implement Yen&#39;s algorithm, because of its high performance. In the implementation, we exploit the graph package in the boost c++ libraries 2, when calculating the shortest path in the graph. 2 provides the Fortran implementation of this algorithm. Java version is added. New C# version is added.  ReferenceM. Pascoal and E. Martins.

 title : The ldapaccountgen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThe purpose of this application is to manage large amounts of user accounts in LDAP from an external database where users join/leave the organization regularly. The main application is written in C# and compiles by default using the mcs compiler (Mono).  </p>

<p>The application reads a MSSQL db table and creates accounts in this table that do not already exists in LDAP. If the account exists the expiration date is pushed back (11 weeks by default - one term/quarter). This is a console application which can be passed switches to run each main method to enable crontab or scheduled runs. </p>

<p>DetailsInstallation only requires that you have either the mcs or csc compilers, the Novell.Directory.Ldap class libraries.  Configuring the global properties can be done several ways, but if done with a text editor you MUST edit 2 files (Settings.settings and Settings.Designer.cs).  The following lists each property and it&#39;s description: </p>

<p>PANSY1conn This is the connection string to a DB2 database. You only need to change this is you also change the source code to include this connection type. </p>

<p>CURRENT_LDAP_SERVER This is the ldap server that is getting the accounts (either dns name or ip address works). </p>

<p>TREE If you are using eDirectory you must put the tree that the ldap server resides. </p>

<p>ORG If you are using eDirectory you must put the org (organization) that the ldap server resides. </p>

<p>VOLUME If you are using eDirectory, this is the volume that contains the user home directories. The volume and directory do not need to exist and creating them is outside the scope of this application. </p>

<p>HOMEDIR If you are using eDirectory, this is the directory that contains the user home directories. The directory do not need to exist and creating it is outside the scope of this application. </p>

<p>PORT The port that ldap is running (default is 389 for most ldap servers).  Using port 636 alone will not enable ssl connections.  You must setup certificates between the ldap server and the client running this application.   </p>

<p>USER This is a user with root or admin rights to the ldap OU where the user accounts are being created/managed. </p>

<p>PWD The password for the USER account. </p>

<p>OS This tells the application where to expect to put the log files.  By default for Windows it will use: C:\temp\logs and for Linux/Unix/Mac it will use: /var/log/SAG2 </p>

<p>COLLEGE_FILE This tells the application which file to use for sub organizational units in the OU where the accounts are being stored.  This is used to translate codes stored in the database that represent meaningful names that are more appropriate for OU names.  Must be an XML file that used the same structure as the file included with the source code. </p>

<p>dataUC This is the connection string to the MSSQL database server.  If you are using this type of database you must correct the values in this string to connect to your database (server).  This is the default means of pulling account information and in order to use something else the code needs to be changed. </p>

<p>PARENT This is the parent location on the ldap server where accounts are stored.  The default is Student but can be anything LDAP compliant but MUST exist on the ldap server.  For eDirectory this falls under the ORG setting in the TREE. </p>

<p>dc Not yet implemented but will be the domain controller for Active Directory accounts.  This would be the domain controller preferred to have the application use/connect to. </p>

<p>domain This is the fully qualified domain for Active Directory accounts and must be the FQN. </p>

<p>durl This is the ldap domain path of the FQN (e.g. dc=domain,dc=com is for domain.com)</p>

 title : The libmv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Currently libmv is only for developers interested in contributing, because it is undergoing a rewrite. It is non-functional at this time. </p>

<p>libmv is a structure from motion library, which plans to one day take raw video footage or photographs, and produce full camera calibration information and dense 3D models. </p>

<p>The first targeted application for libmv is to integrate with Blender to make the first open source matchmoving solution. Other matchmoving programs include Andersson&#39;s SynthEyes, 2d3&#39;s Boujou, RealViz MatchMover, Voodoo Tracker, PFTrack by The Pixel Farm, 3D-Equalizer by Science-D-Visions, Scenespector&#39;s VooCAT, among others. A  high-profile application of structure-from-motion is Microsoft&#39;s Photosynth, which recently released their SfM source code as GPL. </p>

<p>The launchpad site is deprecated and superseded by this code.google.com project. </p>

<p>Matchmoving exampleHere&#39;s a sequence that was matchmoved with libmv1: input video, 2D tracking with UKLT (unfortunately it&#39;s impossible to see the track markers with the compression), Suzanne added with blender. </p>

<p>Note that the old version is finicky, so this example required careful tweaking to successfully track. </p>

<p>Developers needed!If you&#39;re a developer interested in helping, please join the list! There are lots of things to work on depending on preferences and skillset. Someone with Qt experience who&#39;s interested in making a basic GUI could make a big difference to the project. </p>

<p>If you make a patch, please make a code review for it on Rietvelt and mail it to the list.</p>

 title : The maxminfilters Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Fast running maximum-minimum filters in C++. </p>

<p>A running maximum-minimum filter computes the maximum and minimum for each window in a sequence. For example, given these values: </p>

<p>1,2,3,2,1 </p>

<p>Then the running maximum filter with a window of size 3 is: </p>

<p>3,3,3 </p>

<p>whereas the minimum filter is </p>

<p>1, 2, 1 </p>

<p>A running maximum-minimum filter computes simultaneously the maximum and the minimum filters. </p>

<p>This code implements the algorithms described in the following paper: </p>

<p>Daniel Lemire, Streaming Maximum-Minimum Filter Using No More than Three Comparisons per Element. Nordic Journal of Computing, 13 (4), pages 328-339, 2006.  </p>

<p>A preprint is available there: </p>

<p>http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0610046 </p>

<p>One of the result of this paper is that it is possible to compute the maximum-minimum filter faster than it is possible to compute both the maximum filter and the minimum filtering separately.</p>
 summary : <p>MDAnalysis is an object-oriented python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by CHARMM, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.</p>

<p>It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the atomic coordinates through numpy arrays. This provides a flexible and relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In addition, CHARMM-style atom selection commands are implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and written out. </p>

<p>Some time-critical routines are written in C or Cython and require a working C compiler.</p>

<p>MDAnalysis comes with an expanding library of analysis functions such as RMSD-fitting or analysis of lipid membrane bilayers.</p>

 title : The mockitopp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MockitoPP C++ Mocking FrameworkA C++ mocking framework inspired by the ideas developed for Mockito written by Szczepan Faber, et al. The purpose is to provide similar construction semantics for creating mock objects leading to smaller, more readable test cases. It is designed to be a lightweight framework allowing you to mock dependencies for a system under test using a simple descriptive domain specific language. The goal is to help create simpler, less brittle test cases; ultimately, leading to less maintenance overhead in the future. </p>

<p>How Does It Work?MockitoPP uses ABI and template techniques to create mock delegate classes that intercept calls intended for any abstract base class you care to model. The techniques used to construct the mock objects are similar to the techniques used by Automatic Mock Object for C++ (amop), Hippo Mocks and Member Function Pointers and the Fastest Possible C++ Delegates. By exploiting the compiler&#39;s ABI class layout we can dynamically construct a mock delegate class to provide minimal stubbed functionality used during unit testing. </p>

<p>Requirementsoptional: Google C++ Testing Framework (if compiling/running unit tests) </p>

<p>optional: Hamcrest (if using hamcrest argument matchers) </p>

<p>optional: C++ Technical Report 1 or Boost C++ Libraries (if using regex argument matcher) </p>

<p>LimitationsThis framework really only supports pure virtual abstract base classes (i.e. interface). The mocking construction only works for virtual functions declared in the target class to mock. You cannot use it to stub calls to non-virtual functions. In some cases it may be possible to mock a class that is not a pure abstract base class (i.e. hybrid class containing both virtual and non-virtual functions), but you may encounter unexpected results if other objects are expecting the mock object to operate under normal circumstances (i.e. maintain state) or have internal wired dependencies that operate on the object&#39;s state.</p>
 title : The mod-ndb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mod_ndb is an Apache module that provides a Web Services API for MySQL Cluster.  It creates a direct connection from an Apache Web server to the NDB data nodes in a MySQL Cluster (bypassing mysqld, and eliminating the need to create or parse SQL queries at run-time).  This allows you to query and modify a database over HTTP using GET, POST, and DELETE requests, and fetch results in a variety of formats, including JSON results that can go &#39;direct to the browser&#39; in an Ajax application.  Mod_ndb is also scriptable, using Apache&#39;s subrequest API, so that complex multi-table transactions or joins (even including sort-merge join plans that are currently not possible in MySQL) can be easily created in PHP or Perl. </p>

<p>What&#39;s new in mod_ndb 1.1Easier to build:  Now you can build mod_ndb for Apache 2 without requiring apxs from apache 1.3.

 title : The online-compiler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>We have seen that http does all kinds of magic, and moreover the world i dream of contains ppl just sticking up a mouse,keyboard and monitor to network and boot through it. Then start playing whatever movies they want, or compile their very big codes or edit their documents and all. Google took forward this step and created docs.google.com around the same time i got the idea. It was just a matter of designers, which i lacked. And now since we have these many. I propose the idea of online compilers. abstractly speaking an user pastes his code into a form ,not exactly upload the file, Then  the  script is compiled and the errors or warnings are shown. Necessary inputs are asked and outputs are displayed. I think this can be done easily using AJAX. Just imagine u dont need a very big compiler at your desktop and moreover the code is almost platform independent. Just imagine the havocs u must have been faced while a code is properly run on TC and it shows a handful of errors in GCC. All this is gone. Interested buddies can put their names down. Believe me it is not that easy as you might think.</p>

 title : The phpcccompiler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The piped Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PIPED is a Matlab/C numerical program for nanometer scale opto-electronic devices. It is a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method modified with an explicit time-domain electron transport model. PIPED is distributed freely under a BSD license http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php, and all contributions to the project are welcomed. </p>

<p>0.1c releaseThis is a minor upgrade to the previous release. It includes a implementation for simulating plane wave propagation in optical structures. This was achieved by applying periodic boundary condition. I found out this method is actually faster than the traditional total-field / scattered-field (TF/SF) approach, at least for what I am doing. If you have any comments on that, I am interested to know. </p>

<p>The program core is also rewritten in Fortran. A performance improvement of 4-8 can be easily achieved. After I dig more into Intel Fortran compiler performance tuning, I expect to see even better speed. This work is a preparation of MPI parallelization. I am currently comparing Matlab distributed computing engine with native MPI coding. Of course, this change comes with a limitation - you need to install a capable Fortran compiler on your system. </p>

<p>0.1b releaseThe first beta release showcases a two-dimensional (2-D) FDTD program. It currently implements the Drude model of free electrons for metallic matierals, which means that the electron transport is not explicitly modeled. This is, however, the popular approach for simulating surface plasmon polariton photonic device using FDTD. It will be used to benchmarking future algorithms. </p>

<p>The main program is OmegaWise.m, which takes an optional &quot;file name&quot; variable describing the simulation configuration. If missing, the program will use the default OmegaWise.xml. The xml file is almost self-explanatory. When I have more time , I will make a xsl and write up the documentation. At this moment, the format is very immature. Future incompatible changes are very likely. </p>

<p>In the Examples folder, it demos a simple total internal reflection from Si layer to air.  </p>

<p>Another example shows the oblique incident at 600 nm wavelength on a glass-(30nm)Au-air tri-layer slab. The surface plasmon resonance significantly reduces the reflected power. Notice that, Incidence is not plane wave. The conventional TF/SF method needs to be modified to handle dispersive medium. The surface plasmon resonance is very sensitive to the dielectric constant fit from the experimental measurement of Au. Unlike the frequency method, the dispersion plays a significant role even for single-frequency simulation. The calculation is going to make your computer very hot for a few minutes. Running on laptop is discouraged.</p>

<p>July, 18th, 2009 - PlayStation3 CFD cluster </p>

<p>June, 25th, 2008 - Reporting to Robert Szabo </p>

<p>Currently, two projects are being developed: Cell Computational Fluid Dynamics and Algorithms for Cell.  </p>

<p>The hardware available for the project are 5 PlayStation3 consoles, which can be accessed through ssh limited connection. The project is sponsored by IBM and the funds have been used to pay scholarships and hardware. </p>

<p>A side projected developed by the intern Fernando is a VRAM access kernel module available at http://comos.cvs.sourceforge.net/comos/cell-hacks/vram/ . This module differs from the current implementations since it does not rely on lv1 hypervisor kernel API. Together with it, it has the group&#39;s own implementation of lv1 API &quot;caller&quot;, that might enable a more straight foward API for communicating with SPE. </p>

<p>All research developed is reported in RePorts </p>

<p>The projects is being mentorized by ITA Professor Dr. Celso Massaki Hirata, IBM&#39;s University Relation Mauro Assano, and ITA student Daniel Lélis Baggio.  </p>

 title : The pyprop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pyprop is a farily general framework for solving TDSE-like initial value problems, and related problems. The aim is to have a standard framework taking care of parallelization, loading and saving the wavefunction, etc. Discretization schemes and propagation methods are implemented following a standard interface, which enables users to test different methods without requiring detailed knowledge about the implementation. </p>

<p>Propagators for N-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, as well as 3D spherical coordinates are included in the standard package. In addition representations can be combined to create more exotic systems, such as including radial nuclear motion in a diatomic molecule (3D + 1D), combining 3 radial dimensions to simulate a 1D model for a 3-electron atom (1D + 1D + 1D). </p>

<p>Pyprop is written in Python (depending heavily on the numpy module), while all the computationally intensive routines have been developed in C++ (using the blitz++ array library)</p>

 title : The quest-tester Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Quest generates C code that can uncover bugs in a C compiler. The generated code passes complex arguments between functions and thus tests the translation of function calls. This part of a compiler is hard to test with real-world code because complex functions calls are rare. Not totally surprising, Quest uncovered bugs in production-quality compilers. As such, Quest is most interesting for compiler writers. </p>

 title : The sandmanlib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SandMan framework makes windows hibernation file readable and writable. This project also provides a C library and a python portage in further to forensics and offensics features. </p>

<p>Windows hibernation file editor framework. </p>

<p>AbstractFor Windows 2000, Microsoft provides a feature called Hibernation also know as suspend to disk that aims to save the system state into an undocumented file called hiberfil.sys. This file contains all the physical memory saved by the Operating System and aims to be restored by the user the next time the computer is powered on. Live forensics analysis is used to use physical memory dump to recover information on the targeted machine. One of the main problems is to obtain a readable physical memory dump, hibernation is an efficient way to save and load physical memory. Hibernation analysis has notable advantages. System activity is totally frozen, therefore coherent data is acquired and no software tool is able to block the analysis. The system is left perfectly functional after analysis, with no side effects. </p>

<p>IntroductionThe hibernation file opens two valuable doors: The first one is forensics analysis for defensive computing. Hibernation is an efficient and easy way to get a physical memory dump. But the main issue about it was: How to read the hiberfil.sys? That’s how the idea of SandMan born. The second one is a new concept we will be introduced and called “offensics” which is a portmanteau from “offensive” and “forensics”. If we can read hiberfil.sys, can we rewrite it? The answer is: Yes, with SandMan you can.</p>

 title : The sar-os Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The operating system &#39;saros&#39; is built around the idea that small software systems are inherently more portable and less buggy when compared to bigger systems with similar functionality.  Therefore, saros uses an extremely simple microkernel implemented in C++ and relies on user programs to interface with hardware.  This small architecture makes the sar-os kernel ideal for embedded systems, mobile devices, and application deployment. </p>

<p>Software for sar-os is executed using a virtual machine.  A high-level programming language and bytecode compiler target the virtual machine. </p>

<p>The software is released under the MIT License but is held under copyright by Rolla Engineered Solutions, LLC and Ryanne Thomas Dolan.  This means sar-os is free of charge or royalties for commercial, educational, or private uses, so long as you include the copyright notice provided with the software. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I have begun a rewrite of saros in C++.  I am currently targeting POSIX, AVR, and MicroBlaze architectures.  My goals have changed a bit; I want saros to be deployable to POSIX host OSs as before, but I&#39;m also making saros a standalone OS for embedded applications as well.</p>
 title : The simplecc Open Source Project on Open Hub

 title : The slinker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummarySlinker is an attempt to capture the best way to generate slitherlink-type puzzles.  </p>

<p>Slinker 0.1 under Linux 
<br/>StatusSlinker can: </p>

<p>create and solve puzzles of different difficulties using a set of rules verify that puzzles have a unique solution decide whether a puzzle can be directly solved with a given ruleset. can offer useful hints for when you get stuck import/export puzzles as a Loopy string compute more rules, if SlinkerGrid::FindNewRules() makes sense to you </p>

<p>Future workUndo/redo, fix position. Puzzle creation should be faster - can we derive &#39;number removal&#39; rules that tell us which numbers can be removed for a given local situation, given a set of solving rules? Puzzle solving should be faster - solving a 40x30 takes a long time, even with a 4-element ruleset. Puzzles should make more use of the harder rules - rather than removing numbers at random, can we remove those that leave the puzzle only solvable using more complex rules? Export/import as full Loopy format. Need to add option to make a puzzle that would require highlander rules, and also make a list of highlander rules (how?). May want to make &#39;special situation&#39; puzzles - e.g. those involving only &#39;2&#39;s, or those with certain areas empty. How to allow the user to do this? Or provide the programmer with tools to do this? Analysis of puzzle difficulty - max/average level of rules required to solve, need for highlander, etc.? Ideally we&#39;d like to be able to rate every puzzle as scientifically as possible, and seek consensus on the method.  LinksKwon-Tom Loop - an amazing community of Slitherlink-obsessed geniuses.

News30-March-2010: On the interwebs! </p>

<p>As seen on Reddit  (Thanks Steve). 19-Mar-2010: 3.10.0 release Security fix: modp_dota did not handle NaN correct, and may have a buffer overflow problem (certainly produced junk as output)..  Added unit tests to specifically target this issue. New function:  Thanks to IPonWeb:  modp_dtoa2 converts floating point numbers to a string, but without trailing zeros.   It&#39;s a nice addition since this type of function doesn&#39;t exist in the printf-family. Minor fixes to unit test source code to play nice on 64-bit machines (sprintf and type problems). Redid autoconf again.  Mac OS X will complain but should work.  Tested on Ubuntu 9.10 both 32 and 64 bit. Please file a ticket if &quot;./configure&quot; breaks. </p>

<p>12-Feb-2010: 3.9.0 release </p>

<p>Security fix for itoa type functions + matching unit tests Issue 7.  Thanks to simhasana. Fix autoconf annoyances (Issue 8, thanks 0xcafefeed) And a probably failed attempt to make VS2008 happy (Issue 6, thanks to AlienPenguin) </p>

<p>27-Oct-2009: 3.8.0 released </p>

<p>Tested 16-May-2006How It WorksThe main trick with these functions is that they operate on 32-bits at a time and do crazy bit operations instead of regular algorithms that operate with 8-bits at a time. So for instance a standard implementation might do something like </p>

<p>A simple example is doing upper casing an ascii string.  A standard implementation might look like </p>

<p>void toupper_copy1(char* dest, const char* str, int len)
<br/>{
<br/>    int i;
<br/>    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i) {
<br/>        // toupper is defined in                                                                                               
<br/>        *dest++ = toupper(str[i]);
<br/>    }
<br/>    *dest = 0;
<br/>}The problem here is some clibs have crap versions of toupper.  They have to look up the &#39;C Locale&#39; and use a complicated table and bit shifts.  A better version might be </p>

<p>void modp_toupper_copy(char* dest, const char* str, int len)
<br/>{
<br/>    int i;
<br/>    uint32_t eax, ebx;
<br/>    const uint8_t* ustr = (const uint8_t*) str;
<br/>    const int leftover = len % 4;
<br/>    const int imax = len / 4;
<br/>    const uint32_t* s = (const uint32_t*) str;
<br/>    uint32_t* d = (uint32_t*) dest;
<br/>    for (i = 0; i != imax; ++i) {
<br/>        eax = s[i];
<br/>        /*
<br/>         * This is based on the algorithm by Paul Hsieh
<br/>         * http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/asmexample.html
<br/>         */
<br/>        ebx = (0x7f7f7f7ful &amp; eax) + 0x05050505ul;
<br/>        ebx = (0x7f7f7f7ful &amp; ebx) + 0x1a1a1a1aul;
<br/>        ebx = ((ebx &amp; ~eax) &gt;&gt; 2)  &amp; 0x20202020ul;
<br/>        *d++ = eax - ebx;
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    i = imax*4;
<br/>    dest = (char*) d;
<br/>    switch (leftover) {
<br/>        case 3: *dest++ = gsToUpperMap[ustr[i++]];
<br/>        case 2: *dest++ = gsToUpperMap[ustr[i++]];
<br/>        case 1: *dest++ = gsToUpperMap[ustr[i]];
<br/>        case 0: *dest = &#39;\0&#39;;
<br/>    }
<br/>}Here: </p>

<p>the string is treated as a array of uint32_t not chars The integers are manipulated, effectively doing toupper 4 at a time oddballs are are computed using a table, not stdlib calls, or by doing math </p>

<p>For base 2, 16, 65 and 85 even more tricks are used, such as using precomputed shift tables. Take a look at modp_b64_gen to see how this works. </p>

<p>It is probable that a lot of these tricks could be used in Java. I don&#39;t program in Java that much any more, but go nuts.  </p>

<p>That said....Unless your application is doing almost nothing except encoding and decoding, the odds are that these functions will not improve the total performance of your application. Even with slow versions of base64 it&#39;s already so fast it&#39;s probably not measurable in your application.  </p>

<p>Also this is highly compiler version and cpu model dependent.  While it screams on AMD processors and is &#39;better&#39; on Intel processors, it may not do as well on your platform.  Please test (and send me the results from ./speedtest)</p>
 title : The sympycore Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>News26 Mar, 2009 - Pearu slides in SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering 27 Aug, 2008 - Pearu slides in EuroScipy 2008 7 Apr, 2008 - Review conversation methods: ReviewConversionMethods3 5 Apr, 2008 - Introduced new algebras: Set, FunctionRing, Differential 3 Apr, 2008 - Review function support: FunctionSupportIdeas 1 Apr, 2008 - Implemented And, Or, Not. Improved boolean expression support. 15 Mar, 2008 - Reviewing matrix support: MatrixSupportIdeas 10 Mar, 2008 - Introduced SymbolicEquality context where __eq__ and __ne__ methods would return Logic instance. 6 Mar, 2008 - Added pickling support to Expr. 5 Mar, 2008 - All algebra classes are derived from Expr class holding a pair. 2 Mar, 2008 - Implemented extension type Pair giving 1.5-2x speed up. 29 Feb, 2008 - SympyCore version 0.1 released Older news </p>

<p>SympyCoreThe aim of the  SympyCore  project is to seek out new high Performance solutions to represent and manipulate symbolic expressions in the Python programming language, and to try out new symbolic models to achive fundamentally consistent and sufficiently general symbolic model that would be easy to extend to a Computer Algebra System (CAS). </p>

<p>See SympyCore Demo and SympyCore User&#39;s Guide for examples. Various performance improvements are reported in Performance History and SympyCore Benchmark sites. </p>

<p>Sympycore is inspired by many attempts to implement CAS for Python and it is created to fix SymPy performance and robustness issues. Sympycore does not yet have nearly as many features as SymPy. Our goal is to work on in direction of merging the efforts with the SymPy project in the future. </p>

<p>Question: What is the main difference between SympyCore and SymPy projects? </p>

<p>Answer: SympyCore is a research project while SymPy is a software project. </p>

<p>UsageSympycore package is avaliable for download as a gzipped tar archive and as a Windows binary installer.  To install sympycore from an archive, unpack the tar file and run the following command inside sympycore- directory: </p>

<p>  python setup.py installThe development code is available in the SVN repository.  Non-members can check out sympycore using the command (see  Source for more information): </p>

<p>svn checkout http://sympycore.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sympycore-svnUse python setup.py install to install sympycore or add the location of checked out sympycore to PYTHONPATH to make it available for python import. Note that starting from version 0.2, sympycore implements some features in C for speed. However, parallel to that, pure python versions of these features are provided in case one cannot build the provided extension modules. To build the extension modules inside sympycore source tree, use one of the following commands: </p>

<p>  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
<br/>  python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=mingw32  # when using MinGW compiler on windowsImport sympycore with </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympycore import *
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; a,b=map(Symbol,&#39;ab&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (a+b)**3
<br/>Calculus(&#39;(a + b)**3&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ((a+b)**3).diff(a)
<br/>Calculus(&#39;3*(a + b)**2&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ((a+b)**3).diff(a).expand()
<br/>Calculus(&#39;3*a**2 + 3*b**2 + 6*a*b&#39;)See Documentation page for SympyCore User&#39;s Guide as well as other documentation bits. </p>

<p>To run sympycore tests without installing it, execute: </p>

<p>python setup.py [ build_ext --inplace [--compiler=mingw32] ] test [--coverage | --nose-args=&#39;...&#39;]in sympycore source directoryl. </p>

<p>To test installed sympycore, run </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympycore import *
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; test(nose_args=&#39;...&#39;)Feedback and bug reportsYou can report bugs at the Sympycore Issue Tracker. Any feedback can also be sent to SympyCore mailing list.</p>

 title : The tinyaml Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is not yet another Meta-LanguageTinyaML is a virtual machine, a compiler, and a compiler-compiler, powered by the abstract parser tinyap. </p>

<p>It is entirely written in C, endian-safe, and allows easy bindings of new C APIs into the virtual machine. </p>

<p>The VM executes wordcode with a virtual threading model and features a garbage collector. </p>

<p>TinyaML allows the user to compile and run assembly code, or plug new grammars for higher-level languages into the parser and implement the methods to compile their ASTs. </p>

<p>A manual and documentation are in progress at http://beublo23.free.fr/doxygen/tinyaml/. </p>

<p>Version 0.4 features many improvements including : </p>

<p>now compiles and runs in 64-bit archs language layers reorganized (currently script over procedural asm over symbolic asm over meta asm over asm) bug fixes everywhere (which just basically means that everything works as expected), script language improvements : variable-sized argument lists in functions, packing and unpacking arrays from/onto stack, thread handling, local and global symbols shared between asm and script layers (one can use script symbols when writing inline asm), and more... file and tcp/udp socket I/O extension (yeah it&#39;s a basic requirement, but having the core features working well was a priority, wasn&#39;t it ?) And a full-fledged tutorial covering all the aspects of tinyaml, from the basics of the core assembly language syntax to the writing of higher-level language layers and of library extensions ! </p>

<p>Contact me at damien dot leroux at gmail dot com for feedback, suggestions, requests or to help improving the code.</p>
 summary : <p>This is not yet another parser. Tinyap takes some text and an a grammar describing AST as inputs, and outputs another AST that describes the text contents, according to the provided grammar. </p>

<p>Basically, tinyap is a recursive descent parser with backup. Thus, it&#39;s able to recognize any LL(k) language. When a parse is successful, tinyap outputs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the input text in a structured manner. </p>

<p>Unlike most parsers, its code isn&#39;t factory-calibrated for a particular grammar. Instead, the grammar is data. Tinyap uses an AST that represents a grammar to parse its input text. This grammar AST is structured according to tinyap&#39;s grammar description language. </p>

<p>This parser is meant to allow quick and easy development of new languages and the corresponding interpreters or compilers, by defining a single tool and library to parse the source grammar as well as the source text according to the source grammar and walk the resulting ASTs. </p>

<p>The factory default for the grammar AST is the grammar description language itself. So one can parse a grammar description and directly use the parse output to parse some other text written in the described language. Tinyap also features a plugin mechanism for grammars, which allows for dynamic modular grammars. The ASTs tinyap produces can be serialized to and deserialized from buffers and files. </p>

<p>Finally, tinyap provides an interface to walk down the ASTs and makes it easy to write external plugins to visit the nodes, e.g. a compiler, an interpreter, a static evaluator, a renderer... </p>

<p>You can have a look at an extensive use of tinyap at http://code.google.com/p/tinyaml where tinyap is used to parse compile and extend a base meta-language. </p>

<p>A tutorial is available here : http://beublo23.free.fr/doxygen/tinyap/Tutorial.html </p>

<p>Until further request, C++ and Java API are more or less discontinued. </p>

 title : The tiscript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TIScript is a programming language and an implementation of a compiler, a virtual machine running bytecodes and a runtime.  </p>

<p>TIScript uses well known, time-proven and popular language constructs of ECMAScript (JavaScript). </p>

<p>Here is Comparison of TIScript and JavaScript </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>TIScript supports JavaScript runtime behavior as closely as possible. TIScript uses JavaScript notation and syntax in full but with some additions, e.g. lambda functions, types (classes and namespaces) and properties. TIScript uses a simplified prototype model so that &#39;string&#39;.prototype === String  
<br/>evaluates to true in TIScript  
<br/>TIScript supports template content generation similar to PHP and ASP: some literal text  some more literal text  
<br/>TIScript has builtin and native persistence with the classes Storage and Index. We use the term JSON-DB as it is a database which stores JSON objects. We believe that TIScript is the first language to use a JSON-DB idiom.  SVN source distribution includes a makefile and a project file for Dev-C++ (Bloodshed Software.) If you have Dev-C++ and/or GCC/MinGW installed then you can compile it out of the box. </p>

<p>TIScript is used as a scripting engine of the Sciter. </p>

<p>In downloads - tiscript.zip - command line interpretter, does not require installation.   In source - source of it. </p>

<p>Concepts and source code structure. </p>

<p>Our gratitude: </p>

<p>to David Betz for his BOB language implementation. TIScript is derived from BOB in many aspects.   to Konstantin Knizhnik for his DyBASE engine - core of the TIScript persistence. </p>

 summary : <p>WosaicEver wondered what you could do with all the hundreds of digital pictures that you&#39;ve accumulated?  Why not make a mosaic? </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Wosaic is an open source project that allows you to recreate an existing image by using many smaller images, as shown above.  It was started as a project for CS 242 - Programming Studio at UIUC, and will be continuing on to Engineering Open House in the Spring of 2008. </p>

<p>Wosaic is not the only program of its kind.  Several other solutions already exist, however Wosaic aims to be free, easy to use, fast, and accessible.  These qualities are yet to be found in any single existing solution.  We&#39;re also aiming to make use of interesting sources for images.  Currently, we support Flickr, Facebook, and local sources, but we hope to expand this to possibly include images from Picassa, and hopefully other sources as well. </p>

<p>FeaturesEasily create a mosaic out of an image on your disk Utilizes Flickr, Facebook, and local directories for images Supports concurrency to provide fast results Shows progress by constructing the mosaic right before your eyes! Programmed in Java It is FREE and released under the GNU GPL v2. News(3/12/2008) - We&#39;ve released 1.0 beta version of Wosaic!  This release represents a major rewrite in the code for the GUI and general control flow. While this won&#39;t be immediately apparent at first glance, this means major efficiency gains and better stability.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.  For details, please see the ReleaseNotes.  Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. (3/9/2008) - Wosaic was presented at the UIUC Engineering Open House this weekend, and was a major success!  Thanks to everyone for coming out-- we made over 100 mosaics for people visiting our booth.  Also, Wosaic won 3rd place for non-technical exhibits.  For details, click here. (2/17/2008) - Wosaic 0.1 Beta 1 has been officially released!  See the Featured Downloads for source code as well as Windows, Linux, and Mac binaries and installers.  There is also javadoc documentation available in the downloads section.  The featured wiki pages README, Install, and Compile contain detailed instructions about setting up Wosaic, if you run into any problems in installation.

 summary : <p>wx-config is a helper tool used when compiling applications that makes use of the wxWidgets library.
<br/>It helps you insert the correct compiler options on the command line so an application can use
<br/>g++ -o test.exe test.cpp `wx-config --libs --cflags` for instance, rather than hard-coding
<br/>values on where to find wxWidgets and it&#39;s configurations (monolithic, debug, unicode, wxuniversal, etc).</p>

<p>Note that backticks is a property of the shell or the build system used.
<br/>Fortunately the Code::Blocks IDE supports backticks natively on windows.
<br/>For other Windows IDEs and build systems there are workarounds, commonly using *response files*.</p>

 title : The wxpack Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>wxPack is a full wxWidgets development kit. It comes with wxWidgets source and binaries pre-built with selected compilers (VC7.1 and gcc) so the developer doesn&#39;t need to build it. Building wxWidgets is a long and sometimes difficult task and wxPack takes all the work out of using wxWidgets. It has Visual Studio Integration which comes with a &#39;New Project Wizard&#39; and integrated help. This makes the time needed to develop an application only take as long as writing the code for the application. It also comes with an open-source RAD tool called wxFormBuilder (http://wxformbuilder.org). This cuts the time needed to actually develop the user interface down to a bare minimum. Plus there are also other select contributed widgets included as source and binaries that can be used in a developers application.</p>

Also, now every modifier is greedy. The expressions like &quot;.+z&quot; or &quot;\d+3&quot; will never succeed as the first term of the expression will eat all the available characters. Current version under SVN supports: Captures (up to 8) Back reference to captures (e.g. &quot;{a+)b\1&quot; matches aba, aabaa, etc ) Negated expressions that match 0 characters of the input.  07 Feb 2008: Stuck on an issue on the determinization step. The algorithm described in the PDF and implemented in the code succeedn on (a*)(a)a but fails on ([ab]*)(a)([ab]*). I devised a different algorithm, closely following the standard subset construction, that succeeds on ([ab]*)(a)([ab]*) but, alas, fails on (a*)(a)a !  I guess I have to take a step back an rethink the whole thing.  For those interested, the problem is to determine when a set of states needs to be merged again, even if they&#39;ve been already, because of a different tags assignment.  Any suggestion is greatly welcome! 04 Feb 2008: New tarball and Windows binary. This version produces C code!

<br/>How it works?
<br/>Once established the connection from cliente to server, Private and Public Keys are generated on both users with the actual best criptography algorithm, RSA, then Public Keys are sent each other. 
<br/>User A encrypts and send messages with user B Public Key, so do user B with user A Public Key. 
<br/>They can then decrypt the received messages with their own Private Keys. 
<br/>    </p>

<p>Even intercepted messages can&#39;t be read or undestood outside the chat box. </p>

 summary : <p>This proof of concept allows you to hook a cell phone to your computer and use it as a central ‘station’ for receiving and responding to SMS using a map as the main interaction tool.  It was used in Golden Shadow to allow community responders report incidents from different neighborhoods. In this scenario, a community volunteer sent messages to the command center with a location specified as lat/long or an address in the message. This would pop on a map at the command center where a designated operator would triage and reply to those messages. As the day progressed we ‘tracked’ specific users, kept track of the conversation threads, and visualized which areas don’t have enough coverage.  </p>

<p>Key requirements:Receive messages from any phone and place them on a map on the operator’s desktop, Accept position data entered as latitude/longitude or addresses, Allow the operator to reply, showing the threads as a conversation, Allow the operator to maintain a simple address book associating numbers with titles, If the operator is online, upload the information to a website for others to see, Expose the information using standards such as GeoRSS, Allow people to visualize the information in common consumer mapping solutions.  This project takes advantage of the following technologies:RSS and GeoRSS as the standard data representation on the wire, Google Earth as the local interactive mapping application, A simple local web application that gets opened to ‘reply’ to the messages built with ASP.NET, Microsoft Virtual Earth and Google Maps as free online mapping applications, Google Maps geocoding web services to translate addresses into positions, Microsoft Research SMS Toolkit to receive messages and send responses hooked up to an HTC phone, An ASP.NET web application to host the information online and display it using multiple mapping solutions.  Current Status:The quality of this is at a level that could be used for proof-of-concepts, but QA needs to be done to use it in a mission critical environment.  </p>

<p>There are no current active efforts around this project, but the experience of building it and using it in Golden Shadow taught us things we are applying in twitter bots and other efforts.  </p>

 title : The gwt-eclipsecon-chat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an interesting example of an application built using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). Kelly and Miguel spent a Sunday afternoon prior to their tutorial at EclipseCon 2007 developing an instant messenger web application. </p>

<p>The source for Chattr is available in the Downloads section, and you can either get the &#39;complete&#39; app version, or a version that is &#39;working.&#39; The latter was intended for those people who were following along at the tutorial. </p>

<p>More about GWT, in case you&#39;re unfamiliar:  </p>

<p>GWT is an open source Java development framework that lets you escape the matrix of technologies that make writing AJAX applications so difficult and error prone. With GWT, you can develop and debug AJAX applications in the Java language using the Java development tools of your choice. When you deploy your application to production, the GWT compiler translates your Java application to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML. </p>

<p>To get started, download GWT.</p>

 title : The itmchat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Chat server is written in Haxe and uses Neko VM. It is basically a continuous upgrade of Haxe default chat-server example. </p>

<p>Chat client uses flash programmed in Haxe that passes data to Javascript which then enables real-time &quot;in-the-page&quot; HTML chat experience without http polling. </p>

<p>Server, Flash Client and JS Client communicate via Haxe remoting so a biggest deal of gratitude should go to Haxe/Neko maker Nicolas. </p>

<p>Itmchat does some stuff to remain a viable chat experience when you move (or reload) across multiple pages of chat enabled website. </p>

<p>Auto-join-on-reload functionalityYou can reload the page with chat embedded into it, go to other pages that have the chat embedded and the chat should remain fully functional and enable you to chat while doing so. The important point at this goal was that we should not send any info down the wire multiple times (burden our chat-server) unnecessarily. </p>

<p>The reload functionality works like this, let&#39;s say that chat is embedded on some wiki-like page: </p>

<p>You are on the page and you have an inactive chat on the right side You click Join and the chat connects and changes appearance (the JS stores a cookie so that it knows that it&#39;s joined) You chat and then you click a link to go to another page of wiki As the new page loads, chat opens in already active mode, you can see all the chat from the previous page (the client stored messages of previous page into a cookie so this adds no additional load to the server) It takes some time for the browser to load a new page so user would not see the messages that were sent during this page loading. That&#39;s why every message has a number and client always knows the number of the last message it received. When client makes the auto-join it also sends the number of last message it received and the server sends it a package of messages from the current message to that one. This way you can travel, reload, submit web-pages with chat active in the page and no message should get lost.  </p>

<p>Itmchat is work in progress!News and state of things2.2.2008 v.01The chat is in use at one portal for 3 months now.  It is quite basic in &quot;chat features&quot; (no rooms, private msgs, special commands...) Client is rendered as normal XHTML so you can plug it into any page and customize it with CSS, javascript, html quite easily.  Flash client is connected to chat server to which it passes and receives messages from. Flash then passes messages to some low level JS (jsclient.js) than then calls (itmchat.js) which only holds front-end js stuff (callbacks for server events and functions that call the server). If you want to customize the html front-end you could just change functions in itmchat.js . Our itmchat.js uses MooTools to do front-end stuff. Auto-join functionality works The original chat connected to the server when the flash was loaded even if you didn&#39;t join. Now it only makes connection when you join. 16.3.2008 v.02Files are in the svn now Bug fixes Supports multiple &quot;rooms/places&quot; Supports system commands -folks, -all folks, -places, -goto, -where, -where is auto-join-on-reload and rooms functionality is not yet totally stable NOW: Testing and removing bugs. Some load testing will also be necessary soon.</p>

 title : The pytof Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pytof helps you share your iPhoto pictures, and any pictures that are stored in a flat directory since version 0.3.0. It works on Mac, Windows and Linux. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE. If you want to use pytof, the trunk is currently broken. Use revision 361. (Check out first, then svn up -r 361 does the trick). </p>

<p>WebThe default usage of pytof is to create an HTML gallery of your iPhoto albums. You can then put this generated folder online to share your pictures. There is even an ftp push option to automatically push your photo to your website. </p>

<p>EmailsFor those who doesn&#39;t have a personal webpage, you can compress the album generated to an archive, and send it by email to your friends or family. </p>

<p>zip exporting (-z switch) is the simplest method. You just send a zip file to your fellow windows users. tar exporting (-t switch) let you share pictures with Mac and Unix users. Users will just have to double click their email attachments, and open the index.html files within the un-archived iPhoto album directory to view your pictures. </p>

<p>With the -s switch, you&#39;ll discard all the originals pictures, and your archive file will be way smaller, which means that most likely you&#39;ll be able to send it by emails to your friends or family ! </p>

<p>Web servicesWe hope to provide soon a flickr push feature. Flickr let you share your pictures online with some neat features (commenting, geo-tagging, etc...). If there&#39;s a public API for Picassa one day that would be great also. </p>

<p>pytof uses a command line interface for now, but we&#39;d like to provide a graphical user interface in the future.</p>

 title : The diplomacy-strategy-editor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Short DescriptionThis is a standalone java applet that helps designing diplomacy board game strategies. It allows to edit graphically strategy tree with multiple branch. It doesn&#39;t provide hints or  analysis, it only provide a visual representation of a strategy tree. </p>

<p>online vesion - Follow the link to test the tool  on-line. </p>

<p>IntroductionDiplomacy is a tough game. It puts forwards the difficulty to be confident in a conflictive situation, and all the benefits that can be retrieved when an team raise. Moreover the strategic dimension underlies all the exchanges between the players. I have written this tool to allow a player to build a strategy schema. </p>

<p>Play diplomacy at: http://www.diplomatie-online.net </p>

<p>Funny conception tipThis tool is based on a database of countries, name shape and adjacency graph. I have build an editor to help me to create all these data. Provided I&#39;m a single programmer I used Powerpoint extensibility to build an editor. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For each country I draw the shape of all places where an army can be drooped. Notice that in Spain there is only one country, but there is one place for tanks an two coasts for fleets. On each place with a resource center I draw a circle to locate where the resource center icon will be drawn. Then on each place I draw a rectangle to locate where the army icon will be drawn. Finally for each place I write the place&#39;s name in the web text replacement field of the shape. </p>

<p>I draw each county shape on the map and I place circle and square geometry in each one to control. </p>

<p>All these data are gathered and processed thanks to the macro entitled &quot;cool&quot; (how, I should change that now). &quot;cool&quot; write a file in &quot;c:\output.xml&quot; that can is included in the applet package. </p>

<p>http://diplomacy-strategy-editor.googlecode.com/files/diplo-applet-editor.zip </p>

<p>The adjacency data has been entered by hand... I was really long, if you need it it is provided with the sources. </p>

<p>Screen shots and basic useThe top tool palette contains the map, flags, fleets and armies. Drag items from the tool bar to the working area.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>First drag a map from the tool bar to the working area.  </p>

<p>It is possible to translate the working area by using the mouse middle button and moving the mouse. It is also possible to zoom in and zoom out by pressing the mouse right button and moving the pout up and down.  </p>

<p>Now lets drag a few troops and resource center&#39;s flags. Notice that the tanks can only  be dropped on the ground and fleet only on the sea. A nice shape highlights the country that is under the mouse to ease the placement. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is possible to remove items from a map by dropping them into the recycle. It highlights to show that the army will be removed. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Create an attack order by dragging an army over the attacked army of an adjacent place, with pressing the CTRL key. It creates an arrow that symbolizes the attach order. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Create support order by dragging an army over the supported order or the supported army. The army or order highlights to let you know that the support order will be created. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s show the power of this tool. Lets create the strategy tree.  Take the map of the working area ad drag it to a lower place with pressing SHIFT. A new map is created and linked to the initial one.  The application allows to create as many fork as required. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally let&#39;s save the work by using the save disk button.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutThis project is a full blown IDE for the Drools Rule Engine written in Adobe Flex. Although, the actual front-end can be adopted to work for any language.  </p>

<p>GoalThe goal of this project is to create a viable alternative to author rules online rather than offline in Eclipse, text files, or some other uncouth method.  </p>

<p>ReasonsThe reason to choose Adobe Flex is that it compiles into a flash file that can run on any browser or any IDE via Adobe AIR. The other reason is that Flex allows for a very rich user experience.  </p>

<p>The reason to focus on Drools Rule Engine is that it&#39;s a leading open source Rules Engine and lacks in a sophisticated web based rule authoring UI.  </p>

 summary : <p>In this project, we have built several Ajax-based JITIR systems to help report writers. We have experimented with several different ways in which words and phrases from the users document are used to form search engine queries. </p>

<p>The idea of Just-in-Time Information Retrieval (JITIR) is to automatically retrieve useful information for a user based on the users current context; see, e.g., (Budzik and Hammond 1999; Rhodes 2000). The user typically shouldnt have to explicitly enter queries; rather, queries are automatically composed and submitted to a search engine based, e.g., on the content of the document that the user is currently editing. This means that there can be, e.g., a panel of of regularly refreshed search results that the user can consult, if he should wish to.  </p>

<p>Notice: The source code will be updated to GWT 1.7 in the coming few months and the application might deploy to GAE.</p>

 title : The macvim Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MacVim is a port of the text editor Vim to Mac OS X. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>MacVim supports multiple windows with tabbed editing and a host of other features such as: </p>

<p>bindings to standard OS X keyboard shortcuts (⌘Z, ⌘V, ⌘A, ⌘G, etc.), transparent backgrounds, full-screen mode, multibyte editing with OS X input methods and automatic font substitution, ODB editor support, and more.  Most importantly, MacVim brings you the full power of Vim 7.2 to Mac OS X. </p>

<p>Note: MacVim is in no way connected with http://macvim.org.  That site is no longer being maintained and only provides outdated binaries of the old Carbon port of Vim. </p>

<p>Snow LeopardMacVim now builds as 64 bit by default on Snow Leopard (10.6).  I simplified the build process as well, so check out the Building wiki page on how to build your own binary. </p>

<p>The stable build seems to run fine on Snow Leopard, but please consider using a snapshot instead as they are built specifically for Snow Leopard (the snapshot also runs on Leopard). </p>

<p>DownloadThere are two official binaries of MacVim to choose from: </p>

<p>Stable: The latest stable release is MacVim 7.2 stable 1.2 which was released on the 21st of August 2008.  It is a universal binary which runs on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.  Mac OS X 10.6 (&quot;Snow Leopard&quot;) seems to work fine as well but I strongly suggest using the latest snapshot build on Snow Leopard. Snapshot: A new snapshot is released every month or so and contains several features and bug-fixes which have not yet been included in the stable build.  The latest version can be downloaded here. If the download fails for some reason then try using the download mirror. </p>

<p>You may also build your own version from the source code.  Please consider contributing to the MacVim project if you are able. </p>

<p>MacVim is distributed free as charityware (type :h license inside MacVim for details).  If you find MacVim a useful addition to your life please consider helping needy children in Uganda. </p>

<p>Getting startedThe book A Byte of Vim is freely available online and is suitable for newcomers as well as more experienced users of Vim.  Another freely available online book is Vim Recipies which serves as a cookbook where you can look up different ways to perform a specific task. </p>

<p>There are also several Vim tutorials available online, such as this Vim introduction and tutorial.  Once familiar with the basics you may benefit from using the following article on Efficient Editing With Vim as a quick reference.  Before diving into all that material, you may want to read the article &quot;Why use Vim?&quot; which dispels common misconceptions about Vim and also provides examples which illustrate some of its many features. </p>

<p>Vim comes bundled with a tutor which can be quite helpful to go through since it encourages you to experiment as you read. At the moment it requires some trickery to get going, but once there it should be easy to follow.  The tutor is a text file which needs to be copied to a folder where it can be modified.  To copy the tutor to your home folder, open MacVim and type (make sure you are in normal mode first by hitting Esc): </p>

<p>:!cp $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor ~/then hit enter. This will place a file named tutor in your home folder.  Now, to start the tutor simply open that file in MacVim, e.g. by pressing ⌘O to show the file open dialog and then browsing to the tutor file. </p>

<p>How to get helpThere is a fairly active mailing list called vim_mac where you can post questions about MacVim and request new features. Before posting a question, you should consult the FAQ, search the vim_mac archives, and consult the built-in Vim help by typing :h macvim inside MacVim. </p>

<p>Since the binary releases always are a couple of versions behind the source code it is also possible that any problems you encounter may already have been fixed.  Check the change log for the latest updates to the source code. </p>

<p>Help me!If you find a bug, then please file an Issue report but first make sure that it has not already been reported by searching for old Issues. Unless you are absolutely sure that you have really found a bug you should probably post a question on the vim_mac mailing list first. (Note that there are several people answering questions on the mailing list whereas there is only one of me responding to Issue reports.)</p>

 title : The mighty-editor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mighty: The Managed/Mini IDEMighty has suffered bitrot from long neglect. Will be rewriting from scratch, shortlyUseful StuffFAQ License RoadMap IntroductionThe original use case for Mighty is best illustrated by the following user story: </p>

<p>As a programmer who happens to own an Asus Eee PC, I want a lightweight code editor (e.g. low real-estate grabbing ala scribes or notepad++) with intellisense-style code completion and discoverability/exploratory functionality so that I can do some meaningful .Net h4xing in a loonix environment. </p>

<p>One of the most liberating things for me, as a .Net programmer, is the fact that modern .Net IDEs (VS2005+, #dev, MonoDevelop) have decent code-completion/intellisense via reflection/real-time code parsing. How much less time do you spend not having to look at API documentation since starting to program in this environment? Don&#39;t you wish there was a code editor with this functionality but without the resource/screen-size requirements of these environments (for me, a multi-monitor setup is a must because these IDEs have so much crap in them) existed? </p>

<p>Mono&#39;s WinForms implementation has finally matured to the point that it is feasible to implement a real, useful and cross-platform managed code editor so that, finally, .Net programmers won&#39;t be chained to a handful of screen-real-estate-hungry IDEs in order to be able to do useful (read: has intellisense/code completion capabilities) development. </p>

 title : The srl-editor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionSRL (Simple rule language) is a regular expression based language developed to perform fact extraction from plain text. It is designed to operate as a two stage process by firstly extracting a set of predefined entity classes (named entity recognition) and then using these entities to fill in template slots using contextual rules. As an example, SRL is currently being used in the BioCaster project at the National Institute of Informatics for identifying disease outbreaks and their locations from news reports. </p>

<p>One of the key objectives of SRL has been to enable domain experts to develop their own lightweight text mining systems with minimal support from linguists and computer scientists. SRL uses a powerful yet easy-to-understand regular expression language designed specifically for handling tokenized text streams. SRL rules are often written using a simple combination of string literals and word classes (such as a list of country names) to define the matching context. If complexity is required the rules can easily incorporate constraints based on approximate matching, orthography, word distance etc.  The SRL Editor, written in platform independent Java, supports user design of SRL rule sets using a graphic user interface (GUI) aiming for rapid development and test cycles.  </p>

<p>The SRL Editor aims to supply built in support for hand-crafted rule testing and revision, e.g. to find text segments where no rules are matching or to find rules which do not match any text. To enable fast creation and evaluation of rules the SRL editor allows the user to attach a corpus to the rule set, so that all matching contexts to a rule can be found rapidly and the user can instantly see if the rule is useful and correct. Future versions will aim to support improved rule revision mechanisms based on statistical metrics.  </p>

<p>Once SRL rule sets have been developed it is possible to run these in command-line mode on un-indexed text collections.  </p>

<p>DownloadsSRL is available for download here: Version 1.0 Release Candidate 1 </p>

<p>DocumentationThe SRL Manual is available here </p>

<p>A brief video introduction is available and can be downloaded here. There is also a complete description of the language. </p>

<p>For those who wish to use SRL as a library within their own projects there is an introduction to the structure of the SRL library, a code example and the Java-Doc generated documentation. </p>

<p>Language SupportTokenization for languages other than English is supported through Lucene, including: Portuguese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Russian and we are working to include improved algorithms for Thai and Japanese.</p>

 title : The 3d-heart-simulation Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The package was written to explore the electrical wave propagation in a minimally realistic fiber architecture model of the left ventricle (LV). Experimental results (C. Eyster, 1957) indicate a nested, layered geometry for the fiber surfaces of the left ventricle, where fiber directions are approximately aligned in each surface and gradually rotate throughout the thickness of the ventricle. Numerical and analytical results have highlighted the importance of this rotating anisotropy and its possible destabilizing role on the dynamics of scroll waves in excitable media with application to the heart. Motivated by a first principles derivation by Peskin (Peskin, 1989) of the anisotropic diffusion tensor of the LV wall, we implemented a minimally realistic model of the left ventricle that adequately captures the geometry and anisotropic properties of the heart as a conducting medium while being easily parallelizable and computationally more tractable than fully realistic anatomical models. Studies using such a minimal model are complementary to fully realistic and anatomically-based computational approaches, allowing the addition of successively realistic features, thereby providing unique insight into the basic mechanisms of formation and obliteration of electrical wave instabilities.</p>

<p>It is a billiard simulation featuring a simple physics engine as well as some enhanced graphical effects. Note that this is not intended as a fully featured billiard game or simulation, nor will there be any regular updates or support. Nevertheless, if we have some free time to spare we will implement new features, fix bugs, ... </p>

<p>NOTE: The current SVN version is probably broken (I plan a major rewrite of some core classes; this will most likely lead to broken code that will be fixed later on, when I can spare some time). Nevertheless, using the SVN tag &quot;A Kind of Billiard - committed (CGII)&quot; you should find a working version (in fact, as the name suggests, this is the version committed for the lecture). </p>

<p>Long term goals are an improved user interface, improved graphical effects and a more efficient/realistic physics engine. For example, we plan to implement a control using the Wii Remote.</p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to the artificial morphogenesis project.  </p>

<p>This software was started by Oliver Winks whilst working on his PhD at the University of Sussex. The software is a basic 2D simulation of differential genetic networks and cellular development, it is designed to be flexible and extendible so that it can be used in as many projects as possible related to artificial morphogenesis. At the moment it is very simple, but as it is extended for the various projects I will undertake throughout the course of my PhD it will hopefully become a very useful (not just to me but others as well!) tool. </p>

 title : The aurorarnm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Aurora Road Network ModelerAurora Road Network Modeler (RNM) is a set of tools for operational planning and management of travel corridors (road networks comprised of freeways and surrounding urban arterials) and analysis of their performance. It is based on the Aurora Object-Oriented Framework for Simulation and Analysis of Flow Networks and is implemented in Java. </p>

<p>Currently, Aurora RNM consists of three modules. </p>

<p> Simulator is a graphical application with interactive user interface that runs traffic simulations on road networks. Traffic flow and density are computed using the macroscopic Cell Transmission Model. It also computes such traffic characteristics as speed, VMT, VHT, delay and productivity loss and generates flow, density and speed contour plots making it convenient to compare with the real traffic data collected by systems such as PeMS. The user can create simulation scenarios by means of events that change user-specified configuration parameters of the road network at user-specified times.  Configurator is a graphical application with interactive user interface whose purpose is to produce XML configuration files for the Simulator. It can be used to build road networks from scratch; edit existing road networks by deleting or reassigning network components or adding new network components; efficiently provision road parameters such as fundamental diagrams and split ratios; and input demand profiles.  GIS Importer is a graphical application with interactive user interface that extracts road information from the GIS .shp and .dbf files and saves it in the XML format of Aurora configuration file. This configuration file can be refined in the Configurator and then used by the Simulator. It is recommended to use GIS Importer together with the open source OpenJUMP software used for geometric filtering of GIS data.</p>

<p>An auxiliary goal is for me to learn some new things (Python, GTK, Glade, SQLite).  So, the code might not be the greatest and development might be a little slow because I am a beginner in all of those technologies.  But I am trying :) </p>

<p>Send an email to dumbmatter at gmail if you think this project sounds interesting. </p>

<p>2008-08-08: Version 0.1 is released.  Try it out.  If you think it looks interesting and you can code, email me.  There are a lot of things that can be improved. </p>

<p>2008-08-03: All the goals for 0.1 are now complete except for the trade AI and a little bit of polish.  Expect a release later this month. </p>

<p>2008-07-27: Right now I am working towards an 0.1 release that will include basic functionality, but the AI will be weak, the UI won&#39;t be polished, etc.  But it will be a good framework to test and build on.  The only major components left are finances (ticket and TV revenue, etc.), trades (UI is there but AI is not), and playoffs.  But if you checkout the latest source, it should run on most Linux distros and do everything except the three things I just mentioned, if you want to play around with it.

<p>OverviewIn this project, a family is defined as a group of organisms that  behave in a similar manner. Each individual in a family is equipped with sensors, actuators and a mechanism for leaving markers that can be detected by the other  individuals in its family. Families are evaluated in a 2-dimensional  environment E, for a duration of t time units. At the beginning  of each evaluation run, the environment contains n particles of some collectible resource that needs to be gathered and  carried back a specific place (the drop). In the screenshot below,  the system is in its initial state. Each line in the list is  a program that specifies the behaviour of a single family of ant. None of these have been evaluated in the environment yet.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The goal is to evolve cooperative behavior that brings back 
<br/>a maximum amount of collectible to the drop site, starting 
<br/>from any randomly created environment. The behavior of
<br/>each individual in a family is specified by a typed program. </p>

<p>For example (from an individual organism&#39;s perspective):</p>

<p>(1) If I&#39;m carrying a resource particule, and I&#39;m at the drop off point, then I should
<br/>drop the resource. However, if I&#39;m carrying and I&#39;m not at the drop, then I should head
<br/>towards the drop, and on the way, I should drop flags that communicate to the other 
<br/>individuals of my family informations about the location of the remaining resource particles.</p>

<p>(2) If I&#39;m not carrying, then I should check to see if there is any collectables where 
<br/>I am. If there are, I should pick up one item. If there aren&#39;t, check and see if there are
<br/> collectibles within sensory perception field. If affirmative, go to location, otherwise
<br/>check for markers from other individuals, and follow the trail. If there are no
<br/> markers in sensory field, none move randomly.Every ant in a given family behaves the same way, but every family will code a different behavior. The best behaviors (see below for more on the objective function) will then be rewarded by having a higher chance of reappearing in the next round of evaluation. The example algorithm above is simple algorithm and seems to make sense. But is it really the best one? Does the manner by which ants use their capacity to produce and sense pheromones in that algorithm fully optimize the total gathering of food (team work). Might it not be more efficient if instead of carrying the food straight home, the ants dropped it on the way for other ants to pick up ? Or used a strategy that was more complicated ? </p>

<p>Crossover </p>

<p>The purpose of crossover is the production of a genetically diverse population of behaviors. Because each behavior is coded as a tree, it is imperative that the crossover operator that is used forces the production of syntactically valid offspring. </p>

<p>There are two ways of induring syntactic validity: either by reparing faulty trees that are produced by random crossover or setting rules of formation that prohibit the formation of faulty trees. </p>

<p>It is the second approach that was chosen for this task. The specification of the typed language called Antze that was used can be downloaded here is because during the evolution process In order to evolve behavior that were complicated, ....evolving valid program trees using type theory </p>

<p>The Language </p>

<p>$PICKUP: (ENV\xx ENVOBJECT)\xx ANT\rarr ENV\xx (ANT\xx ENVOBJECT)$
<br/>$DROP: ENV\xx (ANT\xx ENVOBJECT)-&gt;(ENV\xx ENVOBJECT)\xx ANT$
<br/>$MOVELEFT : (ENV\xx ANT)\rarr (ENV\xx ANT)$
<br/>$MOVEFRONT : (ENV\xx ANT)\rarr (ENV\xx ANT)$
<br/>$MOVERIGHT : (ENV\xx ANT)\rarr (ENV\xx ANT)$
<br/>$TURNRIGHT : ANT\rarr ANT$
<br/>$TURNLEFT : ANT\rarr ANT$
<br/>$PRODUCEPHEROMONE : ANT\rarr (ANT\xx ENVOBJECT)$
<br/>$SENSEPHEROMONE : (ENV\xx ANT)\rarr bool$
<br/>$SENSEFOOD : (ENV\xx ANT)\rarr bool$Each ant can only move forward, to the left or to the right. Likewise, an ant can only sense for food to its right, left or front. The environment is toroidal (north wraps to south and east wraps to west). The environment can do the following: </p>

<p>$GIVEOBJECT : ENV \rarr (ENV\xx ENVOBJECT)$
<br/>$ADDOBJECT: (ENV\xx ENVOBJECT)\rarr ENV$In order to avoid behavior evolution that overfits a specific environment, every time a new environment is created, the food distribution and quantity is different. There is no most efficient algorithm that applies to all the environments. </p>

<p>The Evaluation function </p>

<p>Each family is evaluated in E by the objective function Fg within tg time units. At the beginning of the run, E contains f0E units of food and ft-1E at the end. For each families, Fg returns a real value proportional to (ft-1E-f0E)/ nF where nF is the number of ants in the family. The population size (the number of families being evaluated) is \lambda </p>

<p>The Software: </p>

<p>The ants behavior is coded in a tree like structure called a CDNAStatement. These are program tree, but they also happen to represent the genotype of the ants. AntEvolver evolves CDNAStatements. It then evaluates each CDNAStatements using an objective function whose primary input is the amount of food a family of ants whose genotype is a particular CDNAStatement gathers. A fitness based non-deterministic selection process is then applied, a bit of mutation is shaked up in the mix and vodka. I mean voila. Using the software </p>

<p>There are three modes: </p>

<p>Ant Simulation mode </p>

<p>In this mode a CDNAStatement (program tree) can be seen in action in the environment. In this mode, the settings for the size of the environment grid and the number of ants can be set by choosing  View -&gt; Setting in the main menu. There is also a slider rule that allows the setting of the pheromonal strength. The  file-&gt;open/file-&gt;save features allows the opening and the saving of DNAStatement files (.ant extension). The Play button on the right toolbar will start the simulation, while the Pause button will pause it. When the simulation is paused, the indicator in the toolbar giving the amount of food left in the environment is updated (not while it is running). Make sure that the simulation is paused before changing any settings while a simulation is running. </p>

<p>The I button on the left toolbar (simulation should be paused) will reset the environment The Grid button on the left toolbar will toggle grid view The Pheromone View Button on the first Resizable bar will toggle pheromone Viewing · The G button on the left toolbar (simulation should be paused) will open DNAStatement in the Tree mode </p>

<p>Tree mode </p>

<p>In Tree mode, the CDNAStatement is displayed in a Tree View control. It can be edited by selecting the new statement and right clicking on the tree item that is to be replaced. Hitting the refresh tree button will then validate the new tree. Make sure the tree is refreshed after a compound else statement is introduced in the tree. </p>

<p>Evolve Mode </p>

<p>Creating a new GP is done by selecting File-&gt;New-&gt;Evolver on the main menu. To start the evolution of the GP, simply enter the generation number to which it should evolve in the EvolveTo edit box on the second top toolbar and press the play button. Each GP is represented as an entry in the main view, and double clicking on its ID number will open it in Tree Mode. When a GP is selected it can be either: </p>

 summary : <p>Le projet CSR(Conception de Systèmes Réactifs) a pour objectif de simuler des robots virtuels dans un environnement généré dynamiquement. </p>

<p>Chaque environnement incorpore une stargate, des clefs pour l&#39;ouvrir, des endroits de ravitaillement en carburant qui peuvent être piégés... et l&#39;objectif de chaque équipe de robots est de trouver les clefs et ouvrir la stargate. </p>

<p>Le projet lui même est écrit en oRis, un langage à la fois orienté objets et orienté agents. Ce langage a été créé par Fabrice Harrouet pour sa thèse de doctorat, qui est disponible, avec les paquets oRis (Linux/Mac OS X), sur sa page personnelle (voir liens). </p>

<p>To be able to compile the source </p>

<p>1. Download the latest version of the game </p>

<p>2. Copy &quot;bin&quot; and &quot;media&quot; from the OgreSDK into the &quot;Test&quot; folder. </p>

<p>Replace all EXCEPT the &quot;resources.cfg&quot; files in the &quot;debug&quot; and &quot;release&quot; folders. </p>

<p>3. Open the .sln file </p>

<p>4. Right-click project -&gt; properties -&gt; select debugging and under working directory,  </p>

<p>for all configurations, set the working directory to &quot;./bin/$(ConfigurationName)&quot; </p>

<p>The code should now be ready to compile. </p>

<p>To run precompiled game </p>

<p>1. Download and extract Pre-Compiled.rar </p>

<p>2. Go into /bin/release/ </p>

<p>3. double-click &quot;Test.exe&quot; </p>

<p>4. Play. </p>

<p>How to play </p>

<p>Use W,S,A,D, up, down left, right arrows to control the camera, one can rotate by using Q and E. </p>

<p>Choose camera by pressing C, pressing many times toggles the different modes. There is free camera and ship camera to select between. If ship camera is selected then the controls apply to the ship and not the camera. </p>

<p>A black hole can be added by pressing B, however upon doing this the game ends and the game have to be restarted in order to play again. </p>

<p>NOTES </p>

<p>Due to some coding the last few hours a bug was encountered in the sound system. If the game is run from inside visual studio, as either debug or release, then it works nice. However, if the pre-compiled is run, then the sounds appear choppy and lacks both 3d spatilization and attenuation the sound also appear to run &quot;faster&quot;. We had no time to locate this bug and sincerly appologizes for any inconvenience. </p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>

<p>The reason to it sounding so bad in precompiled mode is most probably that the a.i planes starts and stops their motors very very many times per second, creating that high pitched noise. If the lines under </p>

<p>SimulationGameState.cpp -&gt; SimulationGameState::setupScene() -&gt; under &quot;crazy Ai test&quot; </p>

<p>if those two lines are commented out then the sound should work properly. </p>

<p>The code had been updated however we have noticed a considerable variation in quality on different computers. If there is a problem with the sound even inside visual studio then one might change the following line to increase quality, however, even this depends on the drivers and the type of your soundcard so try and see what works best. </p>

<p>Change:  In SoundManager.cpp -&gt; SoundManager::Init() -&gt; mSoundDevice = alcOpenDevice( NULL ) </p>

<p>to either mSoundDevice = alcOpenDevice( &quot;Generic Hardware&quot; ); </p>

<p>or mSoundDevice = alcOpenDevice( &quot;Generic Software&quot; ); </p>

<p>The sound works on both my laptop and my home computer, however it does not work on some of the other members computers. If there is some trouble then email me and I&#39;ll se what I can do. Worst case is that it dont work at all, and in that case ill bring my laptop and give you a demonstation. This only further emphasises the fact that openAL is a lesser sound system compaired to others.</p>

<p>À há BeautifulSoup :p</p>

<p>To: instcode
<br/>This code is not written by you. Maybe you&#39;ve leeched it from somewhere then edit
<br/>something. You dont know how to use utf-8 char in .py language means .... you dont have
<br/>any basic about py. Without that knowledge about py, you cannot know how to use urllib.</p>

<p>That code is very basically, no any AI in that stuff.
<br/>Thats why, your guys are a loser. Xin lỗi, nhưng em phải chửi thằng stupid này: </p>

<p>Ặc ặc, why don&#39;t you just make your mouth close and look at the source code of
<br/>BeautifulSoup.py? Why a man in the world just has a big mouth to make an assumption
<br/>instead of using his buffalo eyes to read the header of a source file? =))</p>

<p>Eh man, have you ever used Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML? =)) What I saw from
<br/>your post is you even don&#39;t know why BeautifulSoup is existed =)) Eh man, have
<br/>you ever heard about HTML Tidy? =)) So, if you don&#39;t know, shut your mouth up and
<br/>just spend time on playing game, ok?</p>

<p>No AI in that stuff because I don&#39;t have enough time for both playing and
<br/>coding game/tool, does that matter to you puck? =))</p>

<p>Eh, I&#39;m a loser and you will be next =))Vậy là sau khi nó về nhà google này nọ để bổ sung kiến thức, nó quay lại búa em: </p>

<p>Use your skills at your work, it maybe useful. Keep trying to play game fairly.</p>

<p>PS: BeautifulSoup is rather slower than regex &amp; waste your memory resourses. :-)
<br/>keep in mind, memory is money.Ối trời ơi, nghe có vẻ đàn anh quá, vậy là em phải búa lại nó: </p>

<p>Ọc ọc, oé... What are you talking about? What do you want to prove, big mouth?
<br/>You gave me your words like my teachers did =)) Are you teaching me how to play
<br/>fair? OMFG, you should keep them for yourself, because I don&#39;t think you dare to
<br/>use your protection bots, your auto-buying-bots any more =))...</p>

<p>And about BeautifulSoup, I guess you&#39;ve just googled it, right? =)) I know it is
<br/>never too late to learn, but why didn&#39;t you keep your mouth silent once you realized
<br/>that your knowledge is insufficient?? Why did you keep speaking out more and more
<br/>stupid things like that, man? Eh, Regular Expression is faster than DOM manipulating?
<br/>OMFG, you are talking like a big brother in programming field but you even don&#39;t know
<br/>a sh?t about what RegEx and DOM manipulating are! I think you should make another
<br/>googling and stop making more and more stupid assumption. And if you wanna make a debate
<br/>on this stuff, let&#39;s go to somewhere else ok? HVA online or DDTH, which is your
<br/>familiar discussion board? =))</p>

<p>Cho em dịch đoạn trên sang tiếng Việt:</p>

<p>&quot;Trời ơi, ghẻ rứa pmquan, có biết lập trình hông? Hông biết thì nín chứ đừng quăng
<br/>dao búa ra kẻo mấy người biết chuyện nó cười cho thúi mũi.&quot;</p>

<p>P/S: Xin lỗi bà con, mình sẽ rút trong câm lặng để còn làm việc, mình cũng khuyên
<br/>các bạn đừng nên chơi game nữa, tốn thời gian và tiền bạc lắm :&quot;&gt; Thât đáng tiếc, babybebebe gì đó vào xoá mất bài.. Thôi thì em giữ lại đây coi như là một phần của project vậy :))</p>

Our aim is to investigate hypotheses about evolution, cultural diversification, feedback loops between culture and environment, the evolutionary importance of niches and subcultures, and ultimately the factors that enable self-organization. </p>

<p># That there is a recurrence relation tying environment and culture. # Neither culture nor environment can ever converge upon a permanently stable state until the environment is exhausted. # Cultural Diversity derives directly from local environmental differences. Homogenization of factors across localities reduces diversity (e.g. diffusion of a factor across the entire environment will wipe out any diversity in cultural features sensitive to that factor). # After a dramatic event, the time to stabilize on a new population is an exponential function of the proximity of the environmental perturbation to the bottom of the cultural feature stack. (e.g. very fundamental disruptions will cause a much larger portion of the species-space to be explored). </p>

<p>A full pdf version of proposal.  </p>

<p>Proposal Abstract : </p>

<p>Computer simulations are becoming more and more popular as an excellent tool to illustrate and unravel complex phenomena from social science.  The ISPOC framework face that turn by providing a convenient way of sharing, commenting and verifying computer simulation allowing a peer review process which is the essence of a progress in modern science. </p>

<p>My project consists of three new features that will improve the service using three different perspectives. I plan to add a new functionality, increase availability to wide public and improve the ISPOC credibility among researchers.  </p>

<p>I will add a new functionality by providing a fully automatic and effortless way of uploading simulation results. These outcomes will be gathered in a public resource pool that will allow comparing, testing and presenting results in an attractive form as charts and diagrams.  </p>

<p>I will increase the availability by creating a framework that will enable easily deployment of java applets which are the most accessible form of simulation to people who are not very skilled at configuring, compiling and installing software. </p>

<p>I will improve the credibility of the ISPOC by handling the tender question of legal rights protection by providing a tool that will make adding a license statement an obligatory yet effortless step during the simulation upload.  End-users will be also provided with detailed description of what can they legally do with downloaded simulation.</p>

 summary : <p>A home-grown AI experiment.  Agents live our their &quot;lives&quot; hunting and breeding.  The inspiration for this project is just to see what could be done with no AI or simulation framework to start with.  It&#39;s just for fun. </p>

<p>There are two components: the executable and the library.  In theory the library could be used outside the scope of this project but it wasn&#39;t written for that purpose.  </p>

<p>The executable is a simple command-line app.  The app starts up with a help screen that describes the commands you can perform.  Create a new board, give it a height and width, and add in some herbivores and carnivores.  You can control the verbosity of the simulation events by turning on/off messages about certain activities such as deaths, births, or mutations.</p>

 title : The kspectrum Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>kspectrum is a code that will compute high-resolution spectrum (ka vs nu) from public line-by-line databases, for any thermodynamical conditions (temperature, pressure), and for any gas mixture, with a full control of the accuracy over the results. </p>

<p>These spectrum can be used, for instance, in order to produce k-distribution data sets that are very appreciated for radiative transfer simulations. </p>

<p>This code can be used in order to generate entry data for radiative transfer simulation codes, in various research fields, such as planetary atmospheres (climate studies, simulation of atmospheric general circulation), combustion, etc. </p>

<p>The main idea of kspectrum is that the uncertainty over the resulting spectrum can be specified by the user. The absorption coefficient at each wavenumber will be computed within the specified accuracy limits: the contribution of each known energetic transition will be taken into account, no matter how much computation time it requires. As a consequence, kspectrum does not need line profile truncation or line selection techniques, and no ad-hoc corrections have to be brought depending on the local thermodynamic conditions or species concentrations. Moreover, physical phenomenons such as doppler broadening (resulting in a Voigt line profile), sub-lorentzian profiles and collision-induced absorption are taken into account, within the limits of the present knowledge in spectroscopy. </p>

<p>This code has been tested for Earth and Venus atmospheres, and is known to provide very accurate results (specifically for the Earth, since gas spectrum are well known). </p>

<p>kspectrum is written in fortran 77, and will run on any linux cluster that uses mpich. </p>

<p>INSTALLATION </p>

<p>First, the name of your fortran 77 compiler has to be defined within the F77 environment variable. For instance, add the following line to your .bashrc file: </p>

<p>&gt;export F77=&quot;g77&quot; </p>

<p>if you are using the GNU fortran 77 compiler. Then use &quot;source .bashrc&quot; to take modifications into account. Adapt the previous commands to your situation. If you do not define the F77 variable, your fortran 77 compiler&#39;s name will be asked when compilation commands are executed. </p>

<p>Next,the user should download the most recent archive &quot;kspectrum1.0.4.tgz&quot; and installation script &quot;install_kspectrum1.0.4.bash&quot; in the same directory. Then use the following command: </p>

<p>&gt; ./install_kspectrum1.0.4.bash </p>

<p>The installation script will unzip the archive, creating the main kspectrum directory. It will also compile and run a small program into the /data directory for creating example input data files. </p>

<p>The user should refer to the manual (can be downloaded from the project page or found into the /Doc directory) in order to compile the main executable and to run simulations. The main steps are: </p>

<p>- install MPICH on every system that will take part of your cluster, if you do not already have set up a cluster. </p>

<p>- to edit the &quot;Makefile&quot; file and set the compiler name and compilation options that fit your compiler / system. </p>

<p>- to edit the &quot;includes/max.inc&quot; file and set variables values (although default values should be fine) </p>

<p>- use command &quot;make all&quot; in order to compile the executable. </p>

<p>- install Line-by-Line public databases into the /data directory. </p>

<p>USE </p>

<p>Use command &quot;mpirun -np # kspectrum.exe&quot; to run a simulation, with # the number of processes that have to execute the code. The number of processes should be equal to the number of physical cores of your cluster, plus one. </p>

<p>MODIFICATIONS </p>

<p>Whenever a source file is modified, command &quot;make all&quot; should be use to recompile the modified files. </p>

<p>Whenever an include file is modified, command &quot;make clean all&quot; should be used in order to recompile the executable from scratch. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Results files are located into the /results directory. Each file contains three columns: the wavenumber in inverse centimeters, the absorption cross-section of the gas mixture at that wavenumber, in square centimeters per molecule, and the absorption coefficient of the gas mixture at that wavenumber, in inverse meters. </p>

<p>Results can be used by the &quot;kdistribution&quot; code in order to produce k-distribution data sets. In order to install &quot;kdistribution&quot;, follow the same steps than for KSPECTRUM: </p>

<p>- download the main archive &quot;kdistribution1.0.4.tgz&quot; archive and &quot;install_kdistribution1.0.4.bash&quot; installation script, on the same directory (for instance, at the same level you downloaded &quot;kspectrum1.0.4.tgz&quot; and &quot;install_kspectrum1.0.4.bash&quot;). Please note version numbers should be identical for ksectrum and kdistribution, otherwise format issues will occur. </p>

<p>- run &quot;install_kdistribution1.0.4.bash&quot; in order to unzip the archive. This script will find &quot;kspectrum&quot; if both codes are installed at the same level, and will make appropriate links in this case. </p>

<p>- read the documentation file &quot;/Doc/manual.pdf&quot; to compile and use &quot;kdistribution&quot;.</p>
 summary : <p>LANDIS-II is a forest landscape simulation model that simulates forest succession, disturbance (including fire, wind, harvesting, insects, climate change), and seed dispersal across large (typically 10,000 - 10,000,000 ha) landscapes. LANDIS-II tracks the age and spatial distribution of discrete tree and shrub species and has a flexible spatial and flexible temporal resolution. </p>

<p>LANDIS-II advances forest landscape simulation modeling in many respects. Most significantly, LANDIS-II, 1) has flexible time steps for every ecological process, 2) optionally allows for the incorporation of ecosystem processes and states (eg live biomass accumulation) 3) uses an advanced architecture that allows rapid model development and easy distribution and installation of model components. </p>

<p>LANDIS-II manages and executes discrete extensions (modules or plug-ins). Each ecological process is programmed as an independent extension that interacts with the landscape through an explicit interface with the core LANDIS-II program. The user specifies which extensions will be used to best simulate the forest dynamics of interest. LANDIS-II allows scientists to easily develop and share their own extensions. </p>

<p>LANDIS-II was developed at the Forest Landscape Ecology Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the USFS Northern Research Station, and the Conservation Biology Institute.</p>

 title : The life-center Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The LIFE Project provides an experimental research toolsuite in the field of cellular automata based on conway&#39;s game of life. </p>

<p>conway, artificial, intelligence, ai, cellular, automata, java, c, python, framework, research, game, groovy, rcp </p>

<p>1. MissionThe mission of The LIFE Project is to develop a full suite of applications based on Conway&#39;s Game of Life in order to help to improve research in that field. </p>

<p>The Game of Life is probably one of the oldest and simplest cellular automata to be known, and it has been researched by fans and computer hobbyists for decades. </p>

<p>We feel that the Game of Life has not yet revealed all its secrets so far and that is is an interesting field of research, targeting different topics, such as AI, pattern recognition, applied genetics and geeky fun. </p>

<p>Therefore, The LIFE Project aims to provide the user with a software suite allowing him to: </p>

<p>perform research on its own for his own personal enjoyment or interest, join a collaborative effort involving the community of LIFE enthusiasts and take part of a world-wide LIFE-research network, discover and enjoy the Game of Life from a beginner&#39;s point of view through easy hands-on tools and even through small LIFE-based games, use LIFE and the derived tools and libraries we provide to implement LIFE-based software. </p>

<p>2. GoalsThe LIFE Project is divided into the following components: </p>

<p>2.1 - LIFE SimulatorThe LIFE Simulator is the main component and the primary objective of the project. It is an abstract modular simulator used as a Virtual Machine for LIFE experimentations. The LIFE Simulator can be set to run simulations according to an infinite set of rules defined by static configurations files or scripted behaviors. </p>

<p>2.2 - LIFE EditorThe LIFE Editor is a an intuitive tool for editing LIFE simulations and configurations files for further experimentations. It can also be plugged to the LIFE Simulator in order to allow the user to interact on running simulations. </p>

<p>The LIFE Editor is inter-connected with some of the components described below, such as iLIFE, which is used for instance to interfere on a simulation. </p>

<p>2.3 - LIFE AnalyzerThe LIFE Analyzer is what brings sense to The LIFE Project. This tool, although less enjoyable for beginners, is what will help the users to gather informations on their simulations by interpreting the results and providing these users with a plethoria of data that may prove useful for further improvement of the simulations or of the built-in LIFE tools. </p>

<p>The LIFE Analyzer can be either be used to perform results&#39; analysis at the end of a simulation (or at a given snapshot time), or can be plugged to the LIFE Simulator to analyze the running simulations live and allow the user to peform the changes that best suit their needs. </p>

<p>2.4 - LIFE LabThe LIFE Lab is the experimental toolset of The LIFE Project. This mini-software suite provides the users with a toolset of experimental features allowing them to unleash the full power of LIFE. </p>

<p>It is tied to the LIFE Analyzer as they share most of their internal subcomponents and target the same goal: improving our knowledge of LIFE, the former by providing us with accurate informations, the later by letting us experiment new features, behaviors and tools. </p>

<p>2.5 - sLIFE : a project for a Static LIFE descriptive languageConway&#39;s Game of Life has been on the road for quite a while, and it is a well known fact to the community that a format already exists to store LIFE-patterns. In fact, there are more than one formats and The LIFE Project will insure backward-compatibility with most of them, but our primary target is the dominant one. </p>

<p>However, based on our own personal experiences, we share the thought that a more elaborate format could be used to store more useful datas in a more flexible way than the old-style format. </p>

<p>This is were sLIFE comes to, well... life, and provides users and developers with a convenient, friendly descriptive language and library for improved usability and experiment. </p>

<p>2.6 - iLIFE : a project for an Interactive LIFE scripting languageThe idea of iLIFE comes from the combined specifications of the LIFE Editor, The sLIFE subproject, and from the observations made on other components that may need more than just as simple descriptive language to experience LIFE research efficiently. </p>

<p>Therefore, The LIFE Project thinks it could be interesting to propose a specification for a scripted LIFE language. iLIFE would therefore integrate an interpreter, the language itself and the complete API to have him extended for a better interaction with other componenents of The LIFE Project. </p>

<p>iLIFE would allow the advanced user to take control of The LIFE Simulator and Editor, to implement behavioral routines and sets of rules, or to export LIFE-patterns or experiment as scripts instead as statically descripted configurations through sLIFE or other formats. </p>

<p>(NB: iLIFE should not be confused with aLIFE, a LIFE-based language developed for The LIFE Lab. By &#39;LIFE-based&#39;, we mean than the language is designed and interpreted directly by the Simulator like a standard simulation. aLIFE is an extension to the idea of a LIFE-based Turing Machine also being developed for The LIFE Lab) </p>

<p>2.7 - WorldLIFE : a Distributed LIFE PlatformWorldLIFE is born from the following thoughts: </p>

<p>all LIFE enthusiasts like looking at the funny moving cells, LIFE can take quite a lot of computational power to perform some simulations, well, sometimes geeks just wanna have fun ! </p>

<p>Therefore, WorldLIFE has been conceived as a very serious subproject for a Distributed LIFE Platform, which can also be used for educational purposes and/or entertainment. </p>

<p>WorldLIFE integrates a distributed platform to help federate processing power over a network of any kind (LAN, Internet...), defines the specification for a shared LIFE Simulator communication protocol, and is interconnected with Gaia for data centralization and knowledge gathering. </p>

<p>Now on to the funny aspects of WorldLIFE: instead of using the LIFE Distributed Platform for the only serious purpose of distributing LIFE simulations, we thought users might like the idea of having some fun once in a while, while they keep working on LIFE. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where our the two following simple multiplayer &#39;games&#39; ontop of WorldLIFE take place, WorldLIFE Wars and WorldLIFE Domination. </p>

<p>WorldLIFE WarsW-LIFE Wars is not really a game as it is, because its goal is simply to keep track of the genealogy of a LIFE simulation to determine who, out of several W-LIFE Wars players, is to be declared the Master of LIFE. This is based on the evolution of the Simulation and on rules defining the predation system of the Wars environment. </p>

<p>(Note: Yep, if you think W-LIFE Wars comes from CoreWar, you&#39;re right) </p>

<p>WorldLIFE DominationW-LIFE Domination is being played the same way as W-LIFE Wars, except for one single, but very noticeable difference: the grid used as the LIFE simulation playground is not a standard memory resident grid. </p>

<p>It is the network grid of distributed W-LIFE clients willing to participate to W-LIFE Domination. </p>

<p>Because of this, W-LIFE Domination is not really a game, as you can&#39;t really intend to win the &#39;game&#39; as you are only one and only cell of the grid (well, if you have only one computer). It is just for the fun of it. But of course, for further enjoyment, it is planned to allow the creation of coalitions between clients, so that they would be able to join forces and coagulate themselves as virtual cells on the grid/playground to form usual LIFE-patterns. </p>

<p>Of course, it is possible to keep track of W-LIFE Games simulations on Gaia (simulations results/analysis AND games scores for your glory). </p>

<p>If you wonder if there is an actual interest, apart from the fun, in W-LIFE Games, there is: it is a good way to motivate the community to discover new intelligent and usable LIFE-patterns. </p>

<p>That&#39;s also why W-LIFE Games will follow the improvements of the other components to help the users experiment new features. </p>

<p>2.8 - Gaia : A centralized information system for The LIFE ProjectGaia is what LIFE is all about. It is a centralized information system designed to: </p>

<p>keep track of LIFE improvements and research, by automatically updating data sent by the clients willing to participate, thus providing the world with live LIFE data and the brand new LIFE-patterns being discovered, allow users/developers share their thoughts on the project, federate distributed simulations and administrate/monitor the clustering and load-balancing, deploy new LIFE clients and promote The LIFE Project, run W-LIFE Games tournaments and permanent games, and keep track of the heroic virtual history being written by the participating clients, provide the user with an accessible LIFE-patterns DataBase, run web-based versions of the above softwares for remote testing and trial. </p>

<p>The LIFE Project plans of course to run its own Gaia system that should be regarded by the community as the primary centralized LIFE repository. But in a matter of extendibility, it is planned to distribute the Gaia system to allow individuals or organizations to run their own centralization system. </p>

<p>Gaia is both a centralized distributed platform hosted by The LIFE Project, but can also be deployed on its own by any enthusiast or company to create a private Gaia center. You are then given the option to allow your own gaia node to report LIFE data and results to our main Gaia system, but if you prefer to keep those secrets that&#39;s fine. However, we think it would be profitable for everybody to take part to the global experience, so that we can track of the evolution of LIFE. </p>

<p>(Note: Maybe the best thing to do would be to bundle each LIFE software with Gaia to allow everyuser to have a Gaia node running in the background, all of these nodes being allowed to communicate with each other to share their data, if they want to. This could be a lighter and less missleading design, and also help moderate the stress on a network by using intermediate centralized systems.) </p>

 title : The p2p3s Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project creates a trace-driven simulator, which compares all the current maintenance strategies(eager repair, deterministic lazy repair, randomized lazy repair and proactive repair) in the same context. It can also generate synthetic traces in different manners. The results are produced in different files for users to study. </p>

<p>Getting StartedThe snapshot of p2p3s is showed as follows: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The text panel is used to show the log during the running, including simulation time, number of available nodes at each time point, etc. Users can cancel the running experiment by pressing the button Stop this experiment. </p>

<p>FunctionalityThis simulator provides the functionalities of performing experiments to compare the maintenance strategies as well as generating synthetic data and normalizing the trace. </p>

<p>Generating synthetic traceThis simulator can generate synthetic trace in two modes. One is that all the peers have the same and constant departure/rejoin rate in the entire simulation. The other is that the departure rate and rejoin rate are adaptable and based on the behavior of another trace, which is specified by the user. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Normalizing traceThis simulator can also normalize the trace specified by the user. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Configuring the parametersWhen the trace is ready, users can perform the experiments. P2p3s provides the friendly UI for users to configure the parameters used in the simulation. </p>

 title : The parallelproblemsolving Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Network Structure of Exploration and Exploitation David Lazer and Allan Friedman Administrative Science Quarterly 52:4 (2007) </p>

<p>Whether as team members brainstorming or cultures experimenting with new technologies, problem solvers communicate and share ideas. This paper examines how the structure of communication networks among actors can affect system-level performance. We present an agent-based computer simulation model of information sharing in which the less successful emulate the more successful. Results suggest that when agents are dealing with a complex problem, the more efficient the network at disseminating information, the better the short-run but the lower the long-run performance of the system. The dynamic underlying this result is that an inefficient network maintains diversity in the system and is thus better for exploration than an efficient network, supporting a more thorough search for solutions in the long run. For intermediate time frames, there is an inverted-U relationship between connectedness and performance, in which both poorly and well-connected systems perform badly, and moderately connected systems perform best. This curvilinear relationship between connectivity and group performance can be seen in several diverse instances of organizational and social behavior. </p>

 summary : <p>PuMA: A program for the Bayesian analysis of partitioned (and unpartitioned) model adequacyThe accuracy of Bayesian phylogenetic inference using molecular data has been shown to depend on the use of proper models of sequence evolution.  While choosing the best model available from a pool of alternatives has become standard practice in statistical phylogenetics, assessment of the adequacy of the chosen model is rare.  Programs for Bayesian phylogenetic inference have recently begun to implement models of sequence evolution that account for heterogeneity in process across sites, yet no program exists to assess the adequacy of these models.  PuMA implements a posterior predictive simulation approach to assessing the adequacy of partitioned, unpartitioned, and mixture models of DNA sequence evolution in a Bayesian context.  Assessment of model adequacy allows empirical phylogeneticists to have appropriate confidence in their results and guides the efforts of theoretical phylogeneticists in improving models of sequence evolution. </p>

 summary : <p>Plasticity is a package with a convenient interface, used to run simulations of single cells and networks of neurons.  It is used to explore BCM synaptic modification, Hebbian learning, ICA, and others.  It accompanies the book Theory of Cortical Plasticity,  http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/plasticity/book.html, by Leon Cooper, Nathan Intrator, Brian Blais, and Harel Shouval.  It is available from World Scientific. </p>

<p>This project is supported in part by NSF CRCNS Grant &quot;The Cellular Basis of Receptive Field Plasticity in Visual Cortex:  An Integrative, Experimental and Theoretical Approach&quot; #IIS-0515285 </p>

<p>The basic principle of the simulations is the presentation of pattern and noise vectors to a network of neurons, with specified lateral connectivity and synaptic modification rule.  The pattern vectors are either patches from images or simply read from a pickled .dat file as columns of a matrix.  The noise vectors are generated during run-time.  The interface lets you specify many things including </p>

<p>the dimensionality of the inputs number of channels (left/right eye, ON/OFF channels, etc.) the pattern input files generation of input files from a specified correlation function the noise mean, variance and type (uniform, gaussian, etc.) the lateral connectivity the learning rule constraints on the weights (normalization, saturation limits, etc.) number of neurons number of iterations what information to display Please see the Wiki for some implementation details. </p>

 title : The pymunk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever you need 2d rigid body physics from Python. It is built on top of the very nice 2d physics library Chipmunk,  http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/  </p>

<p>pymunk visionMake 2d physics easy to include in your game :) </p>

<p>It is (or striving to be): </p>

<p>Easy to use It should be easy to use, no complicated stuff should be needed to add physics to your game/program. &quot;Pythonic&quot; It should not be visible that a c-library (chipmunk) is in the bottom, it should feel like a python library (no strange naming, OO, no memory handling and more) Simple to build &amp; install You shouldnt need to have a zillion of libraries installed to make it install, or do a lot of command line trixs. Multiplatform Should work on both windows, nix and OSX. Non-intrusive It should not put restrictions on how you structure your program and not force you to use a special game loop, it should be possible to use with other libraries like pygame and pyglet. </p>

<p>I hope and believe that with the latest release (1.0.0) these points are mostly fulfilled and visible if you use pymunk. </p>

<p>pymunk 1.0.0!Today after much waiting pymunk 1.0.0 was released!  </p>

<p>With this release pymunk has most features I wanted, follows the latest chipmunk version, has quite good api documentation and is fairly well tested and hopefully quite stable. As such I think it&#39;s about time the version is bumped to 1.0.0.  </p>

<p>As this version is updated to include the new features in chipmunk, and also contain at least one breaking change it is not unlikely that it will break your code. On the other hand, now it has the newest callback system (see Space.add_collision_handler), new joints and other cool stuff that will make it easier and more fun to include 2d physics into your program/game :) </p>

<p>Changes from the last release:  </p>

<p>Vec2d now uses radians instead of degrees for all default angle functions. This might break existing code! Upgraded to latest chipmunk.

 title : The simsoup Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SimSoup enables a Chemistry to be defined in terms of Molecule Types and the possible Interactions between them. A simulation run involves introducing Molecules of various types into a Reactor and allowing Interactions to take place between them. The progress of the simulation can be viewed on various graphical displays. </p>

<p>SimSoup version 0.4 includes the features listed below. Items that are new in this release are highlighted in italic. </p>

<p>A Chemistry: Including Molecule Types and Interaction Types A Reactor: In which interactions take place between Molecules of the various types Graphical Views of the Chemistry and Reactor: This includes real time display of the current state of the Reactor and the Chemistry. In each case a network is displayed, along with detailed information in list format Graphical Display of Simulation Statistics: Statistics showing the behaviour of the simulation over time can be displayed in two formats:- Data Series Plots: These show the real-time behaviour of a range of variables that are monitored as the simulation runs. The Data Series to be displayed are selectable from various lists Manhattan Plot: This shows the variability in the composition of the material in the Reactor over time Trackers and Cycle Detection: A Tracker is an object that can be attached to a Molecule. As Molecules take part in Interactions, the Trackers are passed from Reactant Molecule to Product Molecule. This enables cycles to be detected and monitored Mass Conservation: Each Molecule Type has a mass, and only Interactions that conserve mass are allowed Heat and Thermodynamics: Reaction rates are based on considerations of energy and thermodynamics. The rate at which the Reactor releases heat can be displayed as a data series plot Scenario Display: A display of the current scenario and status information on its progress Action Requests: These are requests for events to take place at particular times. For example, an Action Request can be setup to cause a Molecule of a particular type to be added to the Reactor Input Processor: This enables a simulation scenario to be defined in a file and loaded to SimSoup. Any errors in the file are detected and reported to the user System Monitor: A (partly hidden) screen - mainly for diagnostic purposes GTK User Interface: SimSoup now has an improved graphical user interface, fully integrated with GTK.</p>
 summary : <p>The objective of SimSWE is to provide a simulation toolkit for gaining confidence in the empirical analysis (automated or otherwise) of software micro-processes and methods and for validating or obtaining evidence to support software engineering hypotheses and theory.</p>

Actually, the numerical method implemented is only the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) in tree dimensions (3D), which is employed for the simulations. Integration with other ones is further propose. </p>

<p>The system accomplishes three stages: </p>

<p>a) the pre-processing, which defines the geometric and material properties of the problem objects, the grid and time step, the overall system characteristics and estimate the total memory and time for the simulation; </p>

<p>b) the processing, which will calculate the electromagnetic fields at all points of the grid along the time; and </p>

<p>c) the pos-processing, which will permit to visualize the geometry and results and is intended to calculate other physical data, like energy, force, and mathematical data, like Fourier Transform. </p>

<p>The development is focused, in first instance, for Linux Operating System. It is considered that there is the possibility of compiling and using on other platforms too. </p>

 title : The tortugades Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to TortugaTortuga is a software framework for discrete-event simulation in Java.  A Tortuga simulation can be written either as interacting processes or as scheduled events.  A Tortuga simulation can have thousands of entities, and can be part of a larger Java system. </p>

<p>Tortuga was developed by The MITRE Corporation in 2004/2006. </p>

<p>Why TortugaTortuga utilizes a programming paradigm that greatly reduces the burden on the simulation on developer.  Tortuga treats each simulation entity as a separate thread and allows you to provide a run method.  This allows the developer to focus on simulation specifics and not have to worry about littering event handler code all over the place. </p>

<p>Additionally, Tortuga is well-documented, well-tested, and has held up to use in some extremely hardcore simulations. </p>

<p>What You Need to Get StartedYour simulation, as a set of Java classes.  There are simple examples in the introduction (.html files in the source).  The example source code is available from the downloads section or the code repository.  There are more advanced examples: the Sushi Restaurant and MVS models. A Java development kit.  The Sun JDK or IBM JDK will support Tortuga models up to several thousand interacting processes, on any platform supported by the JDK.  The current release of Tortuga has been tested with Sun and IBM versions 1.4.2 and higher. Ant, the open-source Java-based build too.  The current release of Tortuga has been tested with Ant version 1.6.2 and higher.  Ant is supported by eclipse. The Tortuga software, available from the downloads section or the source repository. Developing Your Simulation with TortugaAs part of its support for simulation, Tortuga employs tools from aspect-oriented programming, or AOP. You need not be familiar with AOP to use Tortuga: your simulation classes are written in standard Java. However, the use of AOP in Tortuga requires more elaborate compilation that mere javac. This has been wrapped up in an Ant task included in delegate.jar (Ant task is called &quot;tortuga&quot;, not &quot;delegate&quot;). This task is the reason we assume you are using Ant to build your simulation.  </p>

<p>Ensure you have a JDK and Ant installed. Call the directory that contains your simulation example_home. Use the sample Ant script in the source tree; download it and put it in example_home. The example script assumes  </p>

<p>your source files are under src in example_home your class files will go under classes in example_home you have placed delegate.jar under lib in example_home    The script contains clean, build, and run targets.  Modify the script to run your main simulation class, and run it like any Ant script. </p>

<p>Executing Your SimulationOnce you have compiled your simulation with the Tortuga Ant task, you can execute it like any Java program. The Tortuga library (delegate.jar) must be included on the class path. Nothing else is required. You can use the VM command java at the command line, or you can use the java Ant task.  </p>

<p>Tortuga and EclipseMany Java developers find an integrated development environment like Eclipse helpful. Tortuga simulations can be developed using Eclipse. Although Tortuga employs aspects, as mentioned above, they do not appear in user&#39;s code. Eclipse need not be aware of them. What is required is that your code be built by the Tortuga Ant task. Thus to use Tortuga with Eclipse, you should create an Ant script to build your code with the Tortuga task, and have Eclipse use Ant when it builds your code. </p>

<p>Eclipse makes it convenient to use Ant. Ensure your build script appears in the Package Explorer. Right-click on it and choose &quot;Run&quot; from the pop-up menu. Ant will be invoked with your script. </p>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Eclipse is its debugger. When Eclipse runs an Ant script, it runs the script by default in a separate VM, thus making it impossible to use the debugger. One way around this is to create a run profile for the script. The profile should execute org.apache.tools.ant.Main, with your script supplied as a program argument, like -f myscript.xml. </p>

<p>The current Tortuga release has been tested with Eclipse 3.0.2. This version of Eclipse works without the aspect plugin, AJDT. It also works with version 1.2.0 of the plugin.</p>

 title : The vala-benchmarks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims to implement &quot;The Computer Language Benchmarks Game&quot; in Vala. </p>

<p>Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C. The syntax of Vala is similar to C#, modified to better fit the GObject type system. </p>

<p>From Vala FAQ: </p>

<p>How does the performance of Vala applications compare to other applications? 
<br/>The performance should be pretty similar to GObject/C-based code as there is no Vala-specific runtime library/environment that needs to be loaded. The C compiler can also apply the same optimizations on Vala-generated C code and plain GObject/C code. The Vala compiler uses reference counting in more places than most GObject/C-based applications do. However, Vala allows to fine-tune that easily in performance-critical sections with the weak modifier. 
<br/>If you want to help this project please begin to read HowTo and if you want more informations, look at the documents. </p>

<p>Topic: Secure File Transfer Client for Registered Users - SecureSend </p>

<p>Description of problem: Design a program to easily and securely transfer files between users. </p>

<p>Requirements:  The requirements to complete this task include: A web file server Cryptographic technology Database server </p>

<p>Description of solution:  This is a secure file transfer client program for registered users who have an account on our file server on the internet.  The user will be able to send and receive files securely using our program and the server.  This client program will prompt user for user name and password at the start of the program and these information are sent to the server for authentication, once the authentication process is completed, the program will first check if there are files waiting for this user to download.  If so, the user will be provided with an option to download the file.  This is a secure file transfer because in the program, we will encrypt the file using AES before it’s sent to the server and the decryption key will be encrypted using public key technique and then store both the public key and the file on the server.  Once the receiver log in, the receiver will be notified of a file waiting, and then the receiver will download the file using the program and it will decrypt the file and present it to the receiver. </p>

<p>Architectural Design:  The program consists of several distinct pieces which work together to simulate the file transfer. One component is the database management system for which we will be using MySQL. In this database we will have multiple tables which will describe and store the entire &#39;state&#39; (aside from the actual files in transfer which will be stored on an FTP server). Included will be all the users with their associated passwords, all the files which are waiting to be downloaded along with their encryption keys, and possibly a sort of contacts list in which you will only be able to send to people you have on your list. The other component is the client which will be using the cryptographic libraries build into .NET. It will handle the download of files through HTTP requests and the upload of files to the server via FTP. </p>

<p>Development Schedule (in no specific order): •	Client GUI •	FTP upload •	HTTP request for download •	cryptographic encrypt/decrypt •	SQL queries/communication </p>

<p>Each of these modules can be developed and tested independently of each other so it should be easy to split up the work.  </p>

<p>Ideas for future development: •	zip files before encryption •	offload the entire database operations into a PHP &#39;access layer&#39; to further improve security •	make the file upload go through a PHP or Perl layer to further improve security •	send an email notification to the receiver</p>

 title : The curve25519-donna Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>curve25519 is an elliptic curve, developed by Dan Bernstein, for fast Diffie-Hellman key agreement. DJB&#39;s original implementation was written in a language of his own devising called qhasm. The original qhasm source isn&#39;t available, only the x86 32-bit assembly output. </p>

<p>Since many x86 systems are now 64-bit, and portability is important, this project provides alternative implementations for other platforms. </p>

<p>Implementation  Platform  Author  32-bit speed  64-bit speed  Constant time   curve25519  x86 32-bit  djb  265µs  N/A  yes   curve25519-donna-c64  64-bit C  agl  N/A  215µs  yes   curve25591-donna  Portable C  agl  2179µs  610µs  no  </p>

<p>(All tests run on a 2.33GHz Intel Core2) </p>

<p>Obviously, 32-bit, non x86 platforms are currently underserved. If there&#39;s a demand for a faster implementation, a different limb pattern in the C code would probably work very well. Contact agl AT imperialviolet DOT org if you have a need for such code. </p>

<p>UsageThe usage is exactly the same as djb&#39;s code (as described at  http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html) except that the function is called curve25519_donna. </p>

<p>To generate a private key, generate 32 random bytes and: </p>

<p>mysecret[0] &amp;= 248;
<br/>mysecret[31] &amp;= 127;
<br/>mysecret[31] |= 64;To generate the public key, just do </p>

<p>static const uint8_t basepoint[32] = {9};
<br/>curve25519_donna(mypublic, mysecret, basepoint);To generate a shared key do: </p>

<p>uint8_t shared_key[32];
<br/>curve25519_donna(shared_key, mysecret, theirpublic);And hash the shared_key with a cryptographic hash function before using. </p>

 summary : <p>DescriptionC-Zone uses a proprietary protocol to authenticate and configure clients on their ETTH network. Their Linux client is very basic and brittle: it requires manual IP configuration and lacks informative logging. It is a painful experience for laptop users. </p>

<p>This alternate client, czoink, supports auto-configuring of network interfaces. It will take over any interface that is connected to the C-Zone network, but won&#39;t touch it if is plugged into another network. </p>

<p>Czoink interacts well with NetworkManager other network configuration tools that use ISC DHCP client (dhclient) via the OMAPI protocol. Suspending/resuming a laptop and plugging/unplugging the cable works as expected if you are using NetworkManager (or anything else that starts/stops dhclient automatically when the link status changes). </p>

<p>Czoink also features configurable logging levels and targets, including syslog. </p>

<br/>What is GPeerReview?Traditional journals provide two services: </p>

<p>Find capable reviewers who give feedback, and recommend whether or not the journal should endorse a paper. Publish papers by making them easily accessible to other researchers. </p>

<p>With modern technology, it is no longer necessary for these two services to be tied together. Authors should be able to: </p>

<p>Publish now and seek endorsements later. Seek any number of endorsements. </p>

<p>GPeerReview attempts to makes it easy for authors to seek post-publication endorsements of their works. We provide the following tools: </p>

<p>A command-line tool to digitally sign endorsements (done and available). A web-based version of the signing tool (about 70% done). Client tools for analyzing endorsement graphs to establish credibility (in planning stages). Additional tools to facilitate the running of endorsement organizations (in the brain-storming stages). Tools for analyzing citation graphs (in the brain-storming stages). How Publication Should WorkSo, you&#39;ve got a good idea. You&#39;ve done some experiments, gathered some results, and written a paper. Now what? </p>

<p>The first thing you should do is pre-publish your work. Put your paper, your datasets, scripts, results, etc. on a public server. This does two things: 1- It ensures that science can move rapidly (without waiting for a response from a slow journal), and 2- It protects you from dishonest reviewers who might steal your ideas. (Most reviewers are honest people, but it&#39;s always a good idea to protect yourself.) If there is ever any doubt about who originated an idea, the server logs will prove that you published it first. (Will pre-publishing limit your publication options? No. If some journal doesn&#39;t permit works that were pre-published, you should not support that journal with your ideas anyway. Such journals will try to lock up your ideas rather than promote them. This is not good for you. Pre-publishing is good for you.) Try to publish in a top-tier journal. A few publications with really good journals will benefit your resume/career much more than a lot of publications with so-so journals. It is well worth the extra effort required to get the endorsement of a respected journal. (Notice that up to this point nothing is different. Now, here comes the new stuff...) Also submit your paper to several big-name endorsement organizations (EO&#39;s). An EO is similar to a journal, but it doesn&#39;t care whether or not a paper has already been published, it only cares how good the paper is. An EO doesn&#39;t publish your paper, it just reviews and (hopefully) endorses your pre-publication copy. The &quot;editor&quot; of the EO will solicit the help of qualified reviewers to review your paper (just like a journal). He/she will coordinate double-blind reviews to ensure fairness. If the EO decides to reject your paper, they send you a private email with suggestions for improvement. If they accept it, they will send you a digitally-signed endorsement. (See more about EOs below.) Your c.v. (resume) should list all the endorsements that you obtain for each of your works. The idea that only the publisher can endorse a work is becoming antiquated. It is perfectly reasonable for many organizations to endorse a paper. Valuable endorsements can also come from respected researchers in your field. Send a humble email to some colleagues who might recognize the merit of your idea and who might be willing to use his/her name to help establish your good idea. (This is what &quot;peer review&quot; was originally intended to mean.) Our web-based tools can make it easy for someone to digitally-sign an endorsement, just by filling out a form on a web page. You already spend a lot of time reading papers by other authors. When you find one with an idea that is less recognized than you think it should be, do the community a service and write an unsolicited endorsement of that paper and send it to the author. (GPeerReview provides tools intended to make this process easy.) Note that your endorsement is not anonymous. It has your name right on it, and it links back to your list of publications. If the author chooses to include your endorsement on his/her resume, you will be effectively &quot;linked&quot; with that author and that idea. This can help to show that you are an active participant in the research community. (It could also work against you, so don&#39;t go around endorsing every dumb idea that you find.) Thus, the motivation for researchers to review and endorse each others&#39; works is the same as the motivation for them to write papers. This small evolution to the motivation behind research will help promote a healthy research community that focuses more on recognizing good ideas, and less on publishing for the sake of adding bloat to one&#39;s resume. Endorsement OrganizationsAn EO is just like a journal, except it doesn&#39;t publish your paper. The web page of an EO will link to the pre-publication copies of the papers they endorse. Some of these papers may be published in another journal. That&#39;s okay. Multiple endorsements are a good thing. EOs permit two things that journals prohibit: </p>

<p>You can publish first and seek endorsements later. You can seek multiple endorsements. </p>

<p>An EO is slightly easier to create than a journal, because it doesn&#39;t require a super-reliable server, or a lot of money, or a legal team. When an EO endorses a paper, it will send the author a digitally-signed endorsment. This digital signature can be verified even if the EO goes offline, or goes bankrupt and disappears completely, so the author is protected. The EO can let the author publish the paper wherever he/she wants because the digitally-signed endorsement will no longer validate if the author changes the paper, so the digital signature also protects the EO from authors who might try to sneak in new changes that the EO doesn&#39;t necessarily endorse. Since the EO actually serves no copyrighted material, most of the legal complications with publication are non-existent. </p>

<p>At this point, you might ask: &quot;Where can I find an EO?&quot; Good question. There aren&#39;t many (any?) yet, but there is a clear need for them. If you&#39;re thinking about starting a new journal in your area of research, perhaps you might consider starting a new EO instead. We will do our best to help jump-start your new EO by providing the tools you will need. (If you need any free tools that we don&#39;t provide, please contact us, so we can remedy that deficiency.) </p>

<p>When people begin to think about the idea of obtaining post-publication endorsements, many of them start to become excited about dropping journals completely from the publication process. Will that really happen? It doesn&#39;t matter. As long as journals provide useful services, they will continue to exist. When better services come along, journals will either learn to adapt or the better services will take over. Either way, publication will become better from the perspective of the researchers. If you operate an existing journal, we encourage you to consider taking a few steps to become more like an EO, for the benefit of your research community. Here are some positive changes you can make: </p>

<p>Start giving your authors digitally-signed endorsements that they can display on their resumes. Provide free hyperlinks to an author&#39;s pre-publication copy of the paper. Stop rejecting papers just because another journal already endorses them. (Historically, this reasoning was used to avoid copyright infringement, but you can avoid this problem by simply providing a hyperlink to already-published papers, instead of the actual paper itself. A hyperlink is just as useful to your readers. Most of them won&#39;t even notice the difference.) </p>

<p>Graph AnalysisThere are already so many journals that it can be difficult to determine the credibility of a particular journal. As EOs become more prominent, and as big-name researchers start adding their own endorsements, this problem only becomes worse. Fortunately, this problem is easily solved with graph analysis techniques. (This is another reason why it is important for journals and EOs to digitally sign their endorsements.) A digitally-signed endorsement links back to the endorser&#39;s site. Thus, a big graph/network is naturally formed that reflects the structure of the research community. This graph can be analyzed with fully-automated tools to establish credibility. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the digital signatures aren&#39;t entirely necessary because one can always just visit the joural or EOs website to see if they really endorse a particular paper, but this isn&#39;t friendly to automated analysis. Digital signatures enable computers to do automatic checking. Not every endorsement carries significant weight. Some endorsements mean a lot. Some endorsements mean almost nothing. (For example, if an author creates a journal or an EO for the purpose of promoting his own paper, that endorsement is obviously worthless. This can be easily detected because respected researchers don&#39;t list the endorsement of that organization on their resume.) </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s be more specific about how an automated computer program might determine how well-connected a particular endorser is with the research community. One analysis algorithm might work as follows: </p>

<p>Seed the analysis with a set of well-established researchers in the field. (These might include the chaired professors at your university and a few other researchers who are known for their high-impact ideas.) Use a max-flow/min-cut algorithm to determine the smallest set of endorsements that must hypothetically disappear in order to completely sever the individual being analyzed from the research community. The sum strength of these hypothetically severed reviews now serves as an indication of how well-connected that individual is with the research community (which is defined by the set of seed individuals that you picked). Of course, this is not the only graph-analysis technique available. There are numerous algorithms and metrics for measuring the connectedness, centrality, or other aspects of an individual&#39;s relation to a community. You can design your analysis technique to emphasize the things that you think are important. Thus, there is no single magic formula that can be gamed! </p>

<p>Ultimate GoalWe intend for the peer-review web to do for scientific publishing what the world wide web has done for media publishing. As it becomes increasingly practical to evaluate researchers based on the reviews of their peers, the need for centralized big-name journals begins to diminish. The power is returned to those most qualified to give meaningful reviews: the peers. As long as big journals provide a useful service, this tool will only enhance their effectiveness. But as far as they don&#39;t, we can move forward without them. </p>

<p>GPeerReview, seeks to promote a world where you can: 
<br/>Publish immediately (and get reviews later), Seek an unlimited number of reviews, Verify the integrity of the reviews, Verify the credibility of the reviewers, Publish without limitation on format, style, or number of pages, Maintain complete copyright ownership of your works, and Enhance the acclaim of your already-published works.

 title : The panthercrypt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tamalin PantherPanther is a cryptographic program written in Java and is designed to be secretive. It translates missives or files into ciphertext using the AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm), so that can be later decrypted by anyone with knowledge of the same password which was used to encrypt it. Panther offers installers and packages that can be used with Linux or Windows, but it is also available as a single executable file that can be stored on a flash drive or removable (and possibly hidden or locked away) media.  Panther can also be a secretive, and hidden.  It enables various degrees of concealment and invisibility.  These include The ability to lock and unlock the display (Which hides the text on the screen), and the ability to hide the entire screen (Which sets the screens size to a width of  0, and a height of 0). Panther works fully with Linux, Windows, and Mac, but it is designed mostly for Linux users. Version 3 has been run succesfully on Linux Ubuntu and Windows XP/Vista. Panther also has the advantage of being Tri-Langual, and runs well in English, Spanish, and Italian, thanks to Google Language Tools. However, the Spanish and Italian versions are still very much under development.  This tool can be ideal for sending sensitive information over non-secure protocols, like IM. IM conversations are stored on a server somewhere and can be easily read by anybody, but If Panther is used to encrypt information before being sent, the Advanced Encryption Standard can ensure privacy. </p>

<p>Panther is a product of Tamalin, found at http://www.tamalin.org.  Site currently under construction.</p>

 summary : <p>The provable data possession (PDP) library allows a client that has stored data at an untrusted server to verify that the server possesses the original data without retrieving it or storing a copy himself.  It accomplishes this by generating probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server. </p>

<p>PDP uses homomorphic verifiable tags to minimize the amount of server computation, network traffic and block accesses while achieving a strong guarantee of data possession.</p>

 title : The pykeynote Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pykeynote is a Python extension module for KeyNote.  It provides a high-level object-oriented interface to the KeyNote trust management API.  From the KeyNote web page: </p>

<p>Trust management is a unified approach to specifying and interpreting security 
<br/>policies, credentials, and relationships; it allows direct authorization of 
<br/>security-critical actions.  KeyNote credentials describe a specific delegation of 
<br/>trust and subsume the role of public key certificates; unlike traditional certificates, 
<br/>which bind keys to names, credentials can bind keys directly to the authorization to  
<br/>perform specific tasks. 
<br/>For more information on KeyNote see RFC 2704, keynote(1), keynote(3), keynote(4) and keynote(5). Also, a nice introductory article can be found here. </p>

<p>Although I have developed pykeynote on Linux and minimally tested it on OpenBSD, it will probably work on all Unix-like systems that satisfy the following requirements: </p>

<p>Python version 2.3 or higher. Pyrex version 0.9.4 or higher (optional). The KeyNote trust management system (tested with version 2.3). The OpenSSL cryptographic toolkit (tested with version 0.9.8d). </p>

<p>For the details you can browse the SVN repository; I have included a comprehensive testsuite and a sample application.  There is also the epydoc generated API documentation to help you start coding. </p>

<p>If you are having problems installing KeyNote and pykeynote, Adam Aviv has written detailed instructions for installing both. </p>

<p>The trunk of the SVN repository contains the latest, probably unstable, code.  Nonetheless you may still choose to use it for possible new features and/or bug fixes.  For more details, see the ChangeLog. </p>

<br/>&lt;&gt;This requires you to add your username and password to  qrbg.hrl and is extremely inefficient if you&#39;re only looking for a few bytes.  A fresh request is made for each call to qrbg:get_bytes/1, so be gentle.  If you need several sets of random bytes you&#39;ll want to cache the data and extract bytes from it. </p>

<p>It goes without saying that in its current form, this client is susceptible to a man in the middle attack, so don&#39;t use it for anything sensitive.

 title : The bafprp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The data in a BAF file is documented by Telcordia document GR-1100 which is expensive to license, similar programs like bafview http://www.xach.com/misc/bafview/ were created to help us get at some of the baf data, however it has many short comings.  This program will allow a more thorough and deep analysis of baf records and have many different modes of output, with the ability to make more based on plugable modules. </p>

<p>v 1.3Version 1.3 of bafprp is available for download, please report any bugs or problems. </p>

<p>Special note for 2010As some of you might know bafview was recently updated to allow it to work in 2010.  What some of you might not know is why this was necessary.  PRI files store years as only 1 single digit.  So, 2009 is recorded as just 9.  It has been common practice for both bafview and bafprp to substitute in the remaining year digits but there is a problem.  Originally bafview was hard coded to just tack on the digit in the pri file to 200. This could have caused obvious problems with files dated for 2010.  Bafprp does not have this specific problem.  It looks up the current decade and uses that, however, there is a problem if users decide to parse 2009 files in 2010.  Up to bafprp v1.2.1 those files would get recorded as having taken place in 2019.  In v1.3 you will get a log warning, and it will try and automatically fix the date to 2009 if it can.  Obviously its a bad idea to parse pri files from a different decade, but someone might try it, so if you are worried about it, its probably best to update to v1.3. </p>

<p>Changelog1.2.1 to 1.3 </p>

<p>Added csv output format New record design to make creating records easy New makefiles to build with or without SQL output New BSD specific makefile that does not require gmake (thanks thowe!) Significantly reduced memory footprint yet again Added date auto adjusting code to minimize any problems the new decade might bring Minor house cleaning, typo fixes, etc </p>

<p>1.2 to 1.2.1 </p>

<p>Fixed MS SQL DSN Bug Added getInt and getLong to Phone Number data type Added more field definitions Fixed a bug that caused the program to crash on quad core cpus Improved MS SQL and MySql error reporting</p>

 title : The mappy-email-signup Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BRAD&#39;S MAPPY EMAIL SIGNUPI wanted a quick and easy way to ask website visitors for their  email addresses and locations. This does that via Google Maps. You can see an example of it in action at: http://www.bradsucks.net/live/ </p>

<p>SCRIPT REQUIREMENTSjQuery PHP 4+ MySQL INSTALLATIONGet a Google Maps API key: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html Fill out the variables in map-config.php Create the map-table.sql table Upload the files to your web host Visit index.php for an example implementation You can then include the map selector in any PHP page: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>EXTRAS- You can specify $mapButtonText before including map-selector.php: </p>

<p>$mapButtonText = &quot;add me&quot;; // changes the submit button text to &quot;add me&quot;; </p>

<p>- If your URL has an email variable in it, the email input box will not be  displayed but that email will be passed through. Example: </p>

<p>http://www.yourhost.com/map/index.php?email=user@email.com </p>

<p>In this instance only a submit button will be displayed beneath the map,  but user@email.com address will be saved along with the location. </p>

<p>CAVEATSThere&#39;s no error checking or location updating. Whatever people click and  enter gets added to the database table. </p>

<p>SUPPORTI can&#39;t offer email support of this script (no time) but you can ask your  questions in the Brad Sucks BFF forums and I&#39;ll do my best to answer:  </p>

 summary : <p>The interface displays data as graphs collected from a WS3600 weather station, but also prepares PHP code; bitmaps representing wind and temperature for uploading to a web site; publishing data to Wundergrund. </p>

<p>The data is stored to provide a historical reference in various tables so that it can be displayed or used for whatever purposes. </p>

<p>The code has been written using kDevelop and QT3. </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly new to programming on Linux and have much to learn, my C++/C skills are self-taught, so any advice from people would be great. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there are many people out there who use both Linux and a Lacrosse ws3600, but I think that it would be possible to adapt the code to work with other weather stations, but we&#39;ll leave that until version 2 :) </p>

<p>The data is collected by the mysql3600 function from the Open3600 library, txs to the guys who wrote this as I would not be able to communicate with the weather station. </p>

 title : The mta-tracker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a set of scripts developed by OSS Watch as part of the study &quot;Automatic survey of inbound mail (MX) servers in academic domains in the UK&quot;. </p>

<p>The scripts try to guess what academic institution an ac.uk domain belongs to, find their inbound mail servers and query them in parallel trying to identify what Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is running. Then tables with the results can be built. </p>

<p>The load added to the mail servers by the scripts is negligible, and only public information is used. </p>

<p>These scripts contain a number assumptions which mean they work for .ac.uk only. We are also unable to distribute a list of domains in .ac.uk. </p>

<p>If you are interested in the project, please join our mailing list. </p>

<p>The latest stable release can be obtained from the downloads page. </p>

<p>The class can take a number of email addresses, and return whether they are valid or not. It will group together emails with the same domain, and create a single SMTP connection to the MTA for those emails for efficiency.  </p>

 summary : <p>Taskbar Notifier0.9 Finally Here (Thanks for waiting)Missed call taskbar notifications added, support for 1.1.3 and if run on an iPod Touch will not check SMS or Missed Calls.  It&#39;ll be on installer ASAP. </p>

<p>There are 2 versions.  One for 1.1.3 and one for anything pre 1.1.3.  Please make sure you get the correct one.  The new one runs as mobile and there are other fairly major changes. </p>

<p>This iPhone application adds a small envelope icon in the taskbar when you have an unread email message, a small speech bubble when you have an unread SMS message and a small telephone icon if you have a missed call.  It is useful for reminding you from anywhere within the iPhone user interface that you have an unread message.  This includes the lock screen and on your multiple home screens. </p>

<p>Yes!  You can finally check your email from the lock screen (assuming you have your email set to auto check) </p>

<p>After the initial blue popup when an SMS message is received, the only place in the UI in which you are reminded of the unread message is the home screen, which as we all know is not where you spend the majority of your time! </p>

<p>This application is possibly even more useful for email because you&#39;re never actually notified of these anywhere other than the home screen. </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>Changes in 0.9Once again the code has been significantly cleaned up. It now checks missed calls It fully supports 1.1.3 It now uses an NSTimer to time the checks (if you experience problems with alarms not sounding in the clock application then please let me know.  I have found that deleting an alarm and recreating it seems to fix the problem and I am looking into what is causing it) It now checks whether you are using an iPod Touch or an iPhone and acts accordingly (does not check missed calls and SMS messages on iPod Touch) Know IssuesIf you have unread messages in a disabled account (in preferences) the account will be checked and you will be notified of this message. There is a chance that it may interfere with the alarm clock application (very occasionally).  I have yet to find the exact cause of the problem (it is something to do with my use of NSTimer).</p>

Ett skal till studiehandboken på webben behöver skapas, som möjliggör att de olika användarna enkelt och smidigt kan skapa vyer som presenterar programplaner efter olika behov. Ett sådant behov (av många) är t ex att kunna få en översikt av programplanen för en student som antogs ett visst år på ett visst program. Andra typiska användare är studievägledare, utbildningsledare, examensenheten, m.fl. </p>

 title : The z-mail Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Free, authenticated, end-to-end secure email with any email application (Outlook, Thunderbird) and OS, no plugins. Local encryption/decryption. Uses NMA&#39;s free secure email Zmail Basic (ZmailBasic) for user authentication and superencryption. </p>

<p>This project removes a limitation of Zmail Basic. Free secure email Zmail Basic (ZmailBasic) can be used by anyone to send and receive authenticated secure email. However, even though Zmail Basic provides SSL access for the sender to connect to the Zmail server for authentication and encryption, there is a security gap at the Zmail server where the SSL terminates and the Zmail encryption begins. Likewise, even though Zmail Basic delivers the email encrypted to the recipients&#39;s mailbox, there is a security gap at the Zmail server when the user connects to decrypt the email, where the SSL terminates and the Zmail is decrypted. This project provides a solution for both of these security gaps in Zmail Basic, allowing free end-to-end authenticated and secure email communication.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutBlueprint is a  CSS framework that speeds up the process of creating a grid layout in HTML. It also provides clean typography and a stylesheet for printing. </p>

<p>This is a plugin for the Pylons framework that automatically includes Blueprint CSS files into a project. </p>

<p>InstallYou just need to download the Python egg and install it using easy_instal: </p>

<p>wget http://blueprint-pylons.googlecode.com/files/BluePrint-0.1-py2.5.egg
<br/>sudo easy_install BluePrint-0.1-py2.5.eggIf you&#39;re a Mac user, use Curl instead to download the egg: </p>

<p>curl -O http://blueprint-pylons.googlecode.com/files/BluePrint-0.1-py2.5.egg
<br/>sudo easy_install BluePrint-0.1-py2.5.eggIf you&#39;re afraid of the command line, there are also some installers for Windows and OS X. </p>

<p>UsageLet&#39;s say that you have a Pylons project named foo. Under your project&#39;s root folder, there should be another folder named foo.egg-info. Open the paster_plugins.txt file that is inside it. You just need to the following line to that file: </p>

<p>BluePrintAnd your project is already using the plugin. </p>

<p>To install the Blueprint CSS files onto your project&#39;s public folder, just run the following paster command: </p>

<p>paster blueprintYou are all set to go, happy templating! </p>

<p>CreditsI thank, of course, all the guys from the Blueprint project that made this amazing framework happen. </p>

 title : The css-explorer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The purpose of these scripts is to allow for the debugging of HTML and CSS content using nothing more than the onmouseover event, showing the cascade results as ultimately rendered. It can be invoked in one of two ways: </p>

<p>1) Non-instrusive (preferred) - add a bookmarklet to your favorites/bookmarks. Using this method, you can debug CSS styles on any Web page, whether you host it or not. </p>

<p>2) Intrusive (deprecated) - place a script element in the </p>

<p> section of the page to be debugged. </p>

<p>Both will cause another window to open containing debug information for the page this script was called from. Then you can line the two pages up side by side or with the debug page behind the main window but still visible and then as you mouse over places in the main window, the debug window will show you element tags, ids, titles, names, alt text, the element hierarchy, the class hierarchy (if any) and all the styles being applied to the element. You can also update the style(s) of the element being hovered over on the original page from this debug page. There are tools and add-ins that do this, but this allows the information to be seen without installing anything on the browser, and attempts to work on IE, Firefox, Opera and Safari. </p>

<p>This script has been tested using IE 6 &amp; 7, Firefox 2 (Windows and Linux), Opera 9 (Windows) and Safari 3 (beta - Windows). It does NOT work on Konqueror, at least not when launched by bookmarklet (since Konqueror doesn&#39;t support the javascript: URL binding, at least not that I know of). </p>

 title : The css-trees-and-tabs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Novel method (so far as the author is aware) of displaying tabs and trees using pure HTML/CSS - no javascript needed. </p>

<p>Works on modern browsers which support html labels, css&#39;s :checked property, and css&#39;s + selector. </p>

<p>While playing with radio buttons I accidentally discovered that I could use them to make tabs in my web pages without the use of javascript.  This has already been done, often with pagename&gt;tabname such that the body tag for each page has id=pagename as an attribute.  I&#39;m sure there are other methods too.  A quick google search did not reveal the method I had found.  A couple more minutes with CSS and I had a tree menu which expanded and collapsed on a click.  Cool. </p>

<p>This method is not necessarily better or worse than what&#39;s out there.  It&#39;s just different.  I don&#39;t really care to debate the finer points of whose tabs are more efficient to run or more elegant to read.  This is just another method of doing tabs solely in CSS, without a page refresh.  Use it if you like. </p>

<p>As I already mentioned, this method works for modern browsers.  It relies on form labels clicks going to the appropriate form input as well as css&#39;s :checked property and plus selector.  As of this writing, it works in Firefox2 and Opera but not IE7 and I haven&#39;t even looked at IE6. </p>

<p>See downloads for code.  You&#39;ll have to download treetab.html and style.css to the same directory for a working demo.   </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how css tabs work: </p>

<p>The HTML is straightforward.  You have a form.  Give it an ID so that your css doesn&#39;t clobber other forms in your page.  Each tab goes in the form and has three elements. </p>

<p>input label div  </p>

<p>The input is set to type=radio.  This supplies the page with a behavior.  When you click on a radio button, it gets checked and all other radio buttons get unchecked. </p>

<p>Labels have a for element that indicates which form input they affect.  Each of your labels will point to a radio button.  Unlike a traditional table of text - radio button cells, a label can be clicked on to check it&#39;s radio button. </p>

<p>Finally the div.  This is where the content of each tab lives.  Yes, this means your page will load all the tabs and once and can switch between them without page reloads or AJAX calls. </p>

<p>style.css is where the magic happens. </p>

<p>First we hide the tabs.  You should either class them to .tab or use #tabform&gt;div to select them.  display:none will hide them all. </p>

<p>But tabs that are clicked should be seen.  This is where :checked and + come in.  :checked will match any radio button that is selected.  + is one of those new CSS selectors with a very limited, but occasionally very useful purpose.  E + F selects an F which is immediately preceded by an E.  So in this case, input[type=radio]:checked + label + div.tab will select an div with class tab, whose predecessors are a label and a checked radio button.  Set this div&#39;s display to block.  Now when you click through the radio buttons different divs are displayed!  As the tab divs are set in between the radio buttons, they&#39;ll show up in between them.  Toss in a float:left to push them below the radio buttons.  (Alternatively you could make a row of labels and put your input/tabs elsewhere on the page.  This is probably a better way to do things, though it will mean rewriting some selectors.) </p>

<p>Finally we have to disguise the fact that we&#39;re using forms.  input[type=radio] display:none; will get rid of those pesky circles and leave your clickable labels intact.  Now you have working tabs, with no javascripted mess. </p>

<p>You may want to pretty them up a bit though so that they actually look like tabs.  I like using the following: input[type=radio]+label to format inactive tabs.  I usually give them a 1px solid border. </p>

<p>input[type=radio]:checked+label is the highlighted tab.  To make it look like part of the tab it opens, give it a border-bottom-color: white, or whatever color your tab is.  You may also have to raise the tab div 1px so it&#39;s border gets covered by this white one.   </p>

<p>input[type=radio]+label:hover.  One problem I&#39;ve noticed with this method is that tabs give no feedback that they&#39;re clickable.  You could change the cursor with javascript, but that defeats our no javascript rule.  Instead I&#39;ve been changing the color to blue when hovered over. </p>

<p>div.tab Give your content a border much like the tab border.  Again, you may have to position it up a pixel to make the borders overlap. </p>

<p>Making an expanding tree using this method is trivial.  I won&#39;t go over it in quite as much depth.   </p>

<p>Here you want to use checkboxes rather than radio buttons (unless you want sections to collapse when other sections are opened).  The big difference here is that I took off the pretty colors and borders and added display:block to input[type=checkbox]+label.  This made each label into its own line.  I also removed float:left from the tabs so that they would appear between tabs, rather than under them. </p>

<p>Adding expand and close buttons should be trivial.  Basically you&#39;re going to give each label a background image that doesn&#39;t repeat.  Unchecked the image will be a - (or whatever you choose for your close button).  You&#39;ll want to use a small bit of padding left so that the text doesn&#39;t flow over the image.  Change the image to a + for input[type=checkbox]:checked+label.</p>
 title : The cssbuilder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CSS Builder is a very simple control that is aimed for developers who are designing editors and want that the users of their editor should be able to create custom styles on the fly and they should do it using CSS. The UI can read CSS and generate CSS based on users&#39; selections. It was created because there were no open source CSS generation related controls available at the time of its writing and aims to be the definitive source where developers go to when they need a control for doing what it does best: CSS editing. </p>

<p>Future scope: </p>

<p>Add a live preview window which previews the style being created by the user. Better the selection of some properties such as font-family etc. Start generating CSS styles on specific elements in code, which might also involve generating complex CSS selectors. Stay updated as CSS changes.</p>

 title : The cssjanus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CSSJanus is CSS parser utility designed to aid the conversion of a website&#39;s layout from left-to-right(LTR) to right-to-left(RTL). The script was born out of a need to convert CSS for RTL languages when tables are not being used for layout (since tables will automatically reorder TD&#39;s in RTL).  CSSJanus will change most of the obvious CSS property names and their values as well as some not-so-obvious ones (cursor, background-position %, etc...).  The script is designed to offer flexibility to account for cases when you do  not want to change certain rules which exist to account for bidirectional text display bugs, as well as situations where you may or may not want to flip annotations inside of the background url string. </p>

<p>CSSJanus itself is not always enough to make a website that works in a LTR language context work in a RTL language all the way, but it is a start. </p>

<p>Check out a running django-ified webapp version: http://cssjanus.commoner.com/ </p>

<p>Default CSS is a generic CSS standard for HTML rendering. It resets default browser rendering so you can be sure your page will look the same in any browser. </p>

<p>The main objective is to provide styles for a highly-readable and typographically-beautiful page without you needing to anything other than link to the files. </p>

<p>More specifically, the aims behind Default CSS are to: </p>

<p>create a generic standard for rendering HTML and XHTML elements; increase readability; improve web typography and follow age-old typographic rules; and make the rendered HTML look fantastic across both screen and print media. Default CSS is not meant to be the definitive CSS template, merely one of many.</p>

 summary : <p>Doctest for JavaThis port of Python&#39;s Doctest provides a simple implementation of javadoc&#39;s Doclet interface that produces XML fragments, a JSON index and javascript tests.  </p>

<p>CSS, HTML and an AJAX documentation browser are also included. </p>

<p>This package is a work in progress, I use it to document less4j. </p>

<p>Document and test Java at onceText tagged with @test is compiled by Rhino and saved individually in a doc/tests folder. Tests are expected to be a simple script that returns a boolean, true for success and false for failure. </p>

<p>Here is what a brief Doctest comment would look like for java&#39;s String.equals method: </p>

<p>/**
<br/> * Compare this String to another one.
<br/> * 
<br/> * @param string to compare to 
<br/> * @return true if the two strings compared are equals
<br/> *
<br/> * @test return (
<br/> *    &quot;A&quot;.equals(&quot;A&quot;) == true &amp;&amp;
<br/> *    &quot;A&quot;.equals(&quot;a&quot;) == false
<br/> *    );
<br/> */For documentation purposes doctestj supports the original javadoc tags: @param, @return and @throws. And to enhance your documentation with HTML elements with less markup error, it maps a @h3, @h4, @p and @pre tag to the equivalent HTML titles, paragraph and preformatted text elements. Any other tag (including test) will yield a div element with a CSS class named after the tag. You can still use XHTML markup inside the tagged and the untagged comment text, doctestj will try to validate it and document any XML errors in its output.</p>

<p>NivelStyle es una nomenclatura de clases que implican un concepto para maquetar proyectos pequeños o de gran envergadura sin líneas de código innecesarias. NivelStyle no frena la flexibilidad de tu estructura imponiendo nombres de clases para cada tipo de diagramación que necesites.  </p>

<p>Lo que se logra es que utilizando siempre los mismos nombres de clases, puedas diagramar cualquier tipo de estructura, utilizando la herencia y conservando siempre la flexibilidad para poderla editar y brindarle la apariencia exacta que necesites, sin necesidad de seguir una retícula, eres libre.  </p>

 summary : <p>Ahhh, FrameWorks. They make my work easier and more fun. By taking out the stuff that is repetitive and dull, frameworks establish a great baseline for creative work. So I combined my 2 favorite front end frameworks in Starter Kit. </p>

<p>Starter Kit starts with a simple layout and ties in Blueprint CSS and jQuery. The layout here is something that anyone can do. I find myself having to recreate the same setup over and over, so it made sense to me to create a place for a SVN Repository of my starting point. Of course, this is a little bare bones, but it is designed as a starting place for integration. </p>

<p>Starter Kit Features:Valid HTML and XHTML Conventional Layout Conventional Navigation Metaphors Starter Kit VersionsBlueprint CSS version 0.7 jQuery version 1.2.3 DemoStarter Kit Demo </p>

<p>Blueprint CSS is a fantastic framework for CSS. Using the grid layout, a designer/developer can quickly deploy a fantastic solution with established conventions. Blueprint CSS was launched by Olav Bjørkøy and he has done a great job developing the framework. </p>

<p>And jQuery is an amazing and light framework for JavaScript. Write less code. Do more stuff. jQuery was developed by John Resig and continues with contributions by many developers. </p>

<p>If you are interested in contributing, please do! There are many ways to skin a cat, maybe you know a less messy one. You can contact me direct at dave.merwin@gmail.com. </p>

<p>Framework Versions: Currently the versions used are  </p>

<p>Please Note:I will try to keep Downloads up to date, but frankly, you are better off doing a SVN checkout if you need code. I update SVN religiously. Like I said, this is MY starter kit too, so I use it often. </p>

<p>Ok, I won&#39;t keep downloads up to date. SVN is the way to go. Or you can get it from the demo site. </p>

<p>You would be ill advised to grab this code and push it to a server and call it a day. First it will be bloated with comments for documentation. Second, it will require a great deal of HTTP requests to large files. These files are left uncompressed to learn from, but it will add overhead to your site if you load them as is. Where I work, we use different methods to get all of the requests down and to compress the file size. </p>

<br/>-1stlog归来，人员征集中:http://iceskysl.1sters.com/?action=show&amp;id=257_ 
<br/>有问题的话，在issues里面提出，我们会尽快修复，如果有新需求，请也一并提出，我们会考虑予以实现，谢谢！ </p>

<p>各位开发者到Issues里面提出尚未完成的功能，领取自己感兴趣的功能实现后及时chenckin到SVN上 </p>

<p>1stlog群：group183346@msnzone.cn </p>

<p>很高兴的告诉大家，1stlog的第一个版本发布了，从规划到实现、测试大概有一个月的时间，谢谢朋友们的支持和帮助，谢谢！ </p>

<p>1stlog诞生的背景大家知道，PHP的领域中，被广泛使用的博客系统应该是WP了；Rails版本的blog系统现在用的比较多的应该是typo和simplog 了，这两个也有不少人使用了。但是我用了后觉得不是很符合国人的习惯，很多 地方用着感觉很别扭，于是打算自己动手写一个用着习惯的blog系统。 </p>

<p>1stlog规划做为一个blog系统，需要很好的通用性和易用性，我们平衡两者的关系，通过研究现有blog的特点，规划了1stlog的大部分功能，简单灵活、可扩展。 
<br/>1stlog的命名我们是1sters.com团队开发设计开发的，又是一个blog系统，所以定其名字为1stlog，很合理，不是么， </p>

<p>1stlog的功能点功能点还是很多的，包含但不限于以下列举的这么多。 
<br/> 安装方便，不需要重新编译  Type / Categories / Tags 的管理  日志的发表 编辑 删除  评论及其评论管理  支持Textile可视化和tiny_mce可视化编辑器（简单、高级两种)  Trackback 及其防spider以及灌水机  基于Ajax的search和Trackback地址生成  文章 / 评论的feeds  按照分类或者性质的feeds  单篇文章的feeds输出  个性化展示配置  自定义显示模板  验证码  上传下载文件  选择自己需要的显示模块  可配置每页显示的篇数等显示数目  可以选择自己喜欢的显示模板  用户管理  友情链接  定时备份数据库 等等等。。。 </p>

 title : The anml Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>See europa project for actual license. </p>

<p>ANML is being developed to combine the strengths of several existing modeling languages: AML, NDDL, and PDDL are the strongest influences.   </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>1) Clean temporal semantics, with point conditions and effects (in addition to intervals). IxTeT </p>

<p>2) Action/State based (contrast with NDDL) 2a) Arbitrary internal and delayed access to time 2b) Resource effects, including temporary change 2c) An interval change (:-&gt;) operator (see TGP below) </p>

<p>3) User definable types 3a) Including structured types (vectors/arrays and objects) 3b) And inheritance (for object and symbolic types) 3c) Primitives: Symbol, Boolean, Float/Real, Integer, Character Note: Only the first one/two/three primitive types are traditionally accepted by planning systems </p>

<p>4) Chainable fluent access, aiming at modeling continuous processes: </p>

<p>all  loc == alpha :-&gt; beta; </p>

<p>means </p>

<p>start  loc == alpha; ( all ] loc :-&gt; beta; </p>

<p>but has the advantage of gathering the entire timeline of the action&#39;s interaction with the fluent.  This aims at, for example: </p>

<p>( all ] f(t) := f(start) + m  x  (t - start) / duration; </p>

<p>5) Hierarchical decomposition, by reduction to state-based semantics.  Typical HTN supporting languages add additional constraints, greatly inhibiting comparisons between HTN and non-HTN planners. 5a) The exact meaning, however, differs subtly and importantly from the traditional notion of decomposition.  &quot;motivated&quot; modifies an action to restore the traditional notion wrt to that action. 5b) Shortcuts (ordered and unordered) for the common case, and support for the general case. </p>

<p>6) Quantification, conditional effects, complicated nesting, and so forth are all permitted. </p>

<p>7) Domain level facts and constraints are permitted (e.g. safety constraints) </p>

<p>8) Scoped </p>

<p>9) Many shortcuts for omitting redundant text, e.g.: </p>

<p>all  { foo; bar; baz; } </p>

<p>instead of: </p>

<p>all  foo; all  bar; all  baz; </p>

<p>10) At least conceptually, the boolean/real/symbol/object fragment is entirely compilable to PDDL, and similar restricted forms.  Repeated field references on objects, i.e., object valued functions, might only be partially supportable (PDDL is function free (in the sense of predicate calculus), but much can be circumvented via auxiliary actions). </p>

<p>Note TGP: By default, ANML does not permit non-deterministic models, so the TGP interpretation is not possible.  The TGP interpretation is: </p>

<p>( all ] contains [ ] p := T; </p>

<p>Our default interpretation is: </p>

<p>( all ] p :-&gt; T; </p>

<p>Alternatively, if the TGP behavior is desired, then the following functionally equivalent deterministic construction suffices: </p>

<p>...
<br/>[all] contains [] add_p();
<br/>...
<br/>action add_p() {
<br/>(all] p :-&gt; T;
<br/>[all] contains A or B or C ...;
<br/>}where the disjunction is over all adders of p, so that adding p does have to take the duration of at least one of the actions.  This can be shortened to &quot;motivated&quot;, which stands for exactly such a duration constraint over the requesters of the action by name: </p>

<p>...
<br/>[all] contains [] add_p();
<br/>...
<br/>action add_p() {
<br/>motivated; // means [all] contains 
<br/>    // ;
<br/>[all] p :-&gt; T;
<br/>}More generally, such global arbiter actions can always be employed to force a deterministic resolution of a set of blocking processes; provided that every schedule really does result in the same final state.</p>

<p>Brushwave is licensed under the LGPL. You can use it for any purpose you want. However, if you create some nice images or videos, I would be very pleased if you could send me some material to put on my webpage. </p>

<p>InstallationBrushwave does not have any dependencies besides an OpenGL capable graphics driver. </p>

<p>You can install Brushwave in Layout Mode via &quot;Utilities/Add Plugins&quot;. You will find that Brushwave consists of 2 plugins. One of them controls the settings of the rendering process, the other does the rendering. Both plugins are included in the brushwave plugin binary. </p>

<p>UsageTo render an object with Brushwave, you have to take 2 steps: </p>

<p>a) Per-object settings </p>

<p>Select the object you want to apply the painterly filter to, then open the properties dialog. In the &quot;Geometry&quot;-Tab, add the custom object &quot;Brushwave Object&quot;. Double-click it to manipulate its settings. </p>

<p>b) Global settings </p>

<p>If you rendered the scene now, nothing would happen. You first need to activate the Brushwave image filter. This can be done under &quot;Windows / Image Processing / Add image filter&quot;. Choose the filter &quot;Brushwave&quot;.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s it! If you render the scene now, the model will be rendered in a painterly style. If you save the scene, Lightwave will remember the settings for the next time. </p>

 summary : <p>CodeMaker is a modeling tool that allows desingers to create graphically ERD diagrams. It may look just like any other designing tool, but it has an extra feature: it uses code generators to generate source code from the database model. </p>

<p>Code Generators are plugins that can be dynamically loaded, so basically there are no limits for them: they can be used to generate java code, php code, sql code, etc. You can develope Code Generators yourself, and that way extend CodeMaker capabilities. </p>

<p>CodeMaker will shorten your developing times, and you will end up with a consistent api for database access, that you can fix/improve with just a mouse click. </p>

<p>CodeMaker is a tool created by software developers and oriented to software developers.</p>

 summary : <p>A universal speech recognition model converter (USMC).</p>
 summary : <p>The goal of this project is to produce an open-source model that couples hydrodynamics (circulation and waves), sediment transport, and morphodynamics. The model will be suitable for realistic and useful simulations of processes that influence sediment transport in the coastal ocean, including estuaries, nearshore regions, and the continental shelf over regional length scales (10’s of meters to 100’s of kilometers) and time scales ranging from transport events to decades. The code will be written in modern, portable languages (mostly FORTRAN95) using a modular approach that will allow flexibility and extensibility. In addition to the source code (which will have an open-source license and run on most computer systems from laptops to multi-processor clusters), the project will provide model documentation, training, test cases, tools for processing model input and output, and demonstrated applications.</p>

 title : The elvishrayrenderer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>elvish ray is a powerful programmable renderer with robust productivity of high-quality images, high-perfomance and extremely efficient ray-tracing supports ray differentials. </p>

<p>elvish ray takes advantages of parallel hardware automatically, including thread parallelism, SIMD parallelism both on CPU and GPU, and network parallelism which exploits loading balance using a distributed shared database . </p>

<p>elvish ray simulates caustics, global illumination and volume scattering using a hybrid algorithm. All types of light transports such as diffuse, glossy, specular reflection and transmission and their combinations can be simulated. </p>

<p>elvish ray has its native scene description language supporting geometric primitives including polygons, trimmed free-form surfaces and subdivision surfaces, and solid modeling. A scene can either be described in a text file in ASCII format, or written in a ANSI C binding format with the API of elvish ray. Translators and exporters may be coded for generating such files from modeling or animation systems. </p>

<p>elvish ray also can be integrated into any suitable modeling or animation systems with some corresponding connections. </p>

<p>elvish ray supports incremental changes to the scene database, only the parts of the scene that change from one frame to the next need to be redefined. This allows elvish ray to take advantage of temporal coherency of animation. </p>

<p>elvish ray has a shader-driven architecture and can be programmed through shader writing flexibly. There are a variety of shader types, including lens shader, surface shader, light shader, shadow shader, environment shader, volume shader, texture shader, geometry shader, displacement shader, and imager shader. Shaders can be connected together to build shader trees.</p>

 summary : <p>What is Floodzilla?Floodzilla is the Web based real time flood and natural disasters alert system which is basically targeted to inform people immediately about a flood and natural disasters threat via web. This project has been specially design to display various flood situations around a selected geographical area and areas that have been threatened will be pin pointed by a ‘Place Marker’ and an ‘Info Window’. </p>

<p>The roll of the Flood and natural disasters alert system has a wide range of activities such as giving information about the flood areas immediately, uploading videos and images that are related to particular flooding area, managing Volunteers and Subscribers information, modifying the related data which are added by volunteers, sending flood alert (SMS) to all the subscribers...etc.  </p>

<p>Floodzilla basically targeted to inform people immediately about a flood threat or natural disaster via web.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Floodzilla act as a dashboard that displays various flood or natural situations around a selected geographical area. Areas that have been threatened will be pin pointed by a ‘Place Marker’ and an ‘Info Window’.  A ‘place marker’ is a graphical icon that stands on a particular location on the map. An ‘Info window’ is a component which displays small description about a ‘Place marker’ and it can carry small textual data. Volunteers can upload photos and videos about a particular flooding and natural disasters area. For the sake of convenience and correctness, that information will be moderated before publishing on the site. Moderation can be done via the site administrator. Interested users can register to receive flood and natural disasters alerts via Floodzilla. In this case, people who live near water resources are highly targeted. All subscribers will be alerted by a SMS.</p>

 title : The google-summer-of-code-2008-brl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BRL-CAD is represented and developed by a consortium of individuals in the open source community from industry, academia, government, and private industry from all over the world.  Our organizational interests in BRL-CAD vary across the project&#39;s primary focus areas including computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), solid modeling, and computer graphics.  We have about a half-dozen core developers that are active on a daily basis with the project and several dozen community contributors, modelers, artists, and engineers.  Our developers predominantly interact over IRC and through our various mailing lists. </p>

<p>The BRL-CAD package is a powerful cross-platform open source solid modeling system that includes interactive solid geometry editing, ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis, image and signal-processing tools, system performance analysis tools, a robust high-performance geometry engine, and much more.  Currently standing at more than a million lines of code, 400 utilities, and hundreds of man-hours investment, BRL-CAD has more than 20 years of development history (since 1979) and is in production use by more than 2000 organizations around the world (this was our last statistic before we went open source and became untraceable). </p>

<p>As useless bragging rights and fun statistics, the Ohloh source code statistics site recognized BRL-CAD as having &quot;the world&#39;s oldest source code repository&quot;.  Ohloh is a site that tracks the commit activity for more than 12,000 open source repositories performing in-depth historical analyses and commit tracking.  When they reviewed the project histories for all projects in their database, BRL-CAD came in as the oldest project that has had continuous uninterrupted activity even edging out Emacs and GCC: </p>

<p>http://www.ohloh.net/blog/worlds_oldest_source_code_repositories </p>

<p>Released as open source software just a little over three years ago, BRL-CAD has received considerable attention from the CAD and solid modeling communities.  We&#39;ve had more than 230K downloads within last 12 months alone and our download rate is increasing.  As far as we&#39;re aware, BRL-CAD is actually the only open source solid modeling system available with production-quality capabilities under an OSI-approved license. </p>

<p>The BRL-CAD user-base is primarily composed of individuals in the CAD industry where the modeling requirements are fundamentally different to those of content modelers (e.g., Blender) that are used for animation, gaming, and film purposes.  Where content modelers include commercial products like Maya, Softimage, and 3D Studio; BRL-CAD&#39;s primary competitors are in an entirely separate industry where commercial products like Unigraphics, Solidworks, Pro/Engineer, CATIA, and AutoCAD dominate.  See  for a visual overview of where BRL-CAD fits within the various CAD industries. </p>

<p>Our goal is to become the best solid modeling system available by encouraging collaboration throughout the CAD communities, improving recognition that we&#39;re a production-quality F/OSS project, providing effective/better user-friendly tools, and by continuing to work hard at implementing the features needed by our users.</p>

 title : The jtrace-psych Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jTRACE is a freely-available re-implentation of the TRACE model of spoken word recognition. It is implemented in Java, and runs on any computer that supports Java. Researchers can run simulations quickly and easily, using code that has been validated against the original TRACE code. Advanced programmers can extend the jTRACE model to implement new behaviors. </p>

<p>Wait a minute, what&#39;s TRACE? TRACE is a highly influential model of speech perception and spoken word recognition, created by Jay McClelland and Jeff Elman (1986). The original implementation of that model was used to run dozens of simulations comparing TRACE&#39;s behavior with results from experimental studies with human subjects. TRACE&#39;s behavior accounted for human behavior in a number of important ways, and it is still frequently cited as the canonical interactive-activation model of speech perception and spoken word recognition. TRACE has proved remarkably robust, accounting for results in paradigms that were developed 10 years after the model (e.g., fine-grained time course measures from eye tracking). </p>

<p>jTRACE was created by the Magnuson Lab at the University of Connecticut with the support of the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communications Disorders.</p>

<br/>It unfortunately disappeared with its author and this MindPixel {R.} aims to take over were it left off.</p>

<p>This Revival or Resurrection project intends to rebuild a Digitally Conscious Computer Program like Mr McKinstry&#39;s former GAC (Generic Artifical Consciousness). We hope to be able to rebuild a database similar to the one of the former Digital Mind Modeling Project by collecting enough MindPixels, and would like to improve McKinstry&#39;s system in different ways.</p>

<p>Even though McKinstry&#39;s approach and ideas were highly controversial, we at Digital Alien Software Systems deeply believe he was on to something that could be really innovative and as the MindPixel project seemed to be dead, we thought it would be to bad to have this brilliant idea wasted in vain.</p>

<p>If by any chance, someone who used to be in touch with Chris McKinstry would like to collaborate with this project or help in any way, we would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>After Mr McKinstry death, we tried to contact a potential maintainer of the MindPixel project but couldn&#39;t reach anyone, so we really hope we&#39;re not intervening and/or colliding with another project. In that particular case, we would also be glad to hear from you and apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

 summary : <p>The Hidden Topic Markov Model </p>

<p>We propose modeling the topics of words in the document as a Markov chain.  Specifically, we assume that all words in the same sentence have the same topic, and successive sentences are more likely to have the same topics. Since the topics are hidden, this leads to using the well-known tools of Hidden Markov Models for learning and inference. We show that incorporating this dependency allows us to learn better topics and to disambiguate words that can belong to different topics. Quantitatively, we show that we obtain better perplexity in modeling documents with only a modest increase in learning and inference complexity. </p>

Its purpose is to help generate kinds of parametric curves and surfaces, like extrusions, revolutions, lofts, Bezier and NURBS. Another important feature of the library is to help implement multiple polygon technologies. The subdivision of low polygons is supported at present. It also helps construct the binary space partitioning (BSP) trees and do boolean operations (Intersection, Union and Difference) based on the BSP. </p>

<p>New ReleaseosgModeling 0.1.1 is available on November 17th, 2008. Changes includes: </p>

<p>New polygon mesh generator to convert any geometries to vertices-edges-faces list. New subdivision classes to support Loop and Sqrt(3) methods to subdivide polygon meshes. New normal generator to generate normal arrays using different mean weights (MWE, MWA, MWSELR, MWAAT, MWELR, MWRELR). New osgdb_osgmodeling plugin for read/write osgModeling objects in .osg files. Only a framework at present. Support for creating the document and .chm help file based on doxygen. FeaturesSupport for 4 kinds of curves: k-degree Bezier curves. k-degree NURBS curves. Helix (3-dimensional spiral curves resembling a spring). And user customized curves. Support for 6 kinds of surfaces: m,n-degree Bezier surfaces. m,n-degree NURBS surfaces. Extrusions (constructed by a profile extruded along a path). Revolutions (constructed by a profile rotated specified angles). Lofts (constructed by lofting a series of curves that define the cross section on a specified path). And user customized models. Generate normal arrays and texture coordinate arrays for various models (except user customizations). Support generating normals with different weights. Support the normal-flip operation. Free to define customized algorithms to created vertices arrays, normal arrays and texture coordinate arrays for own models. Construct the polygon mesh structures (Vertices-Edges-Faces) for geometries. Subdivide polygon meshes into higher level using different methods. Loop method: Split each face into 4 parts at every level to build subdivisions. Sqrt(3) method: Split each face into 3 parts at every level to build subdivisions. Construct the binary space partitioning (BSP) trees for models in built or converted from osg::Geometry. Geometric boolean operations (Intersection, Union and Difference) based on BSP trees of models. SnapshotsSubdivision of the Stanford Bunny.

 title : The sbpipeline Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The process of constructing and testing models, particularly those that incorporate significant prior knowledge, involves multiple steps that are currently very poorly integrated. We have developed SB-Pipeline to create an effective workflow based on open-source code, public standards and modern software practice.  </p>

<p>SB-Pipeline is a multi-faceted software platform that pulls together all of the steps involved in collecting and transforming primary data; constructing, annotating and calibrating models; and distributing and sharing simulations and analyses. SB-Pipeline is primarily concerned with data and model management for the purpose of calibration; in existing modeling tools, calibration is an ancillary rather than a primary activity. Conversely, SB-Pipeline does not recreate existing tools for model simulation. Second, SB-Pipeline implements a robust system for tracking the provenance of data, links between data and models, and the origins of model assumptions in data or the literature. Third, SB-Pipeline is a collection of discrete but interoperable software tools, rather than a single integrated system. SB-Pipeline incorporates standard protocols for import and export of data and thus components can be integrated into external packages.  </p>

<p>SBPipeline comprises a number of toolboxes to store and handle data and models in systems biology:  </p>

<p>DataRail is an open source MATLAB toolbox for managing, transforming, visualizing, and modeling data, in particular the high-throughput data encountered in Systems Biology. </p>

<p>CellNetOptimizer is a MATLAB toolbox for creating logic-based models of signal transduction networks, and training them agains high-throughput biochemical data.  </p>

 title : The sphinx-modeler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The sphinxmodeler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The story of Sphinx</p>

<p>I have been an addicted object modeler since 1990 when I acquired a copy of Rose 1.0. In those days we used Booch notation to communicate architecture or design views. In 1996 I was fortunate to participate in the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Object Technology User Group (OTUG) and collaborated with that community to produce Unified Method 0.8, UML 0.91, and 0.92
<br/>&amp;nbsp;specifications which was later revised and submitted to the OMG. During that time I created a UML modeling tool written in the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Delphi programming language. It was likely the first tool to implement the UML meta-model. Sadly my hard disk crashed at the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;time and the code was unrecoverable (really would have been good to submit to open source for historic purposes).</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;In 2000 I discovered the WikiWikiWeb and suddenly embarked on the realisation that after all these years, I was actually using
<br/>&amp;nbsp;various modeling tools (incl. Rose) as a nothing more than a glorified drawing tool. That was when I decided to fuse the concept
<br/>&amp;nbsp;of the original Wiki design principles and modeling together. The result was a collaborative modeling environment where diagrams
<br/>&amp;nbsp;and Wiki markup were treated no differently. The diagrams were able to morph when rendered depending on the resolution of the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Wiki link.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;Within 3 months I developed a Wiki based on Struts and EJBs (yet another mistake in my career) and an agile modeling tool based
<br/>&amp;nbsp;on Java web start technology. That modeling tool was known as Sphinx. The &#39;self.amigo&#39; package name used in Sphinx is a tribute
<br/>&amp;nbsp;to Grady, Jim and Ivar; otherwise known as the Three Amigos.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;Whilst these days I am forced to use tools like RSA on various consulting assignments, I still use Sphinx for all other uses.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Sphinx was modeled on the early (and more stable) editions of Rose without all the unnecessary software baggage. To this day, I
<br/>&amp;nbsp;still recall an email exchange with John Vlissides encouraging me to port Sphinx to Eclipse. I never did! My Delphi UML tool and
<br/>&amp;nbsp;my 3 month Collaborate Modeling Wiki sprint had taken its toll; I never developed another modeling tool again. However, I did
<br/>&amp;nbsp;entertain the proposition for 10 seconds when I discovered the Google Web Toolkit.</p>

<p>The self runtime library
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Note, this is a very old runtime library that I have evolved since 1996. I rarely use it now because the Apache Commons project
<br/>&amp;nbsp;has made it obsolete. However, there are some interesting maths routines like EllipseEquation, LinearEquation and
<br/>&amp;nbsp;QuadraticEquation that I needed to write when I developed the UML modeling tool. I hope exploring this codebase proves to be an
<br/>&amp;nbsp;education exercise. I also hope that you come to realise just how much todays software developers stand on the shoulders of open
<br/>&amp;nbsp;source. When I wrote this software there was no Apache Commons, there was no graphic element framework, there was however the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;JDK.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;During the process of preparing this code for open source, I thought I would take the time
<br/>&amp;nbsp;to quickly walk through my work over the many many years. It is truely bizarre, each source
<br/>&amp;nbsp;file tells a story like I&#39;m flipping through a personal photograph album. Whilst I share the
<br/>&amp;nbsp;code, you are perhaps missing out on the most valuable part, the journey.</p>

 title : The streamtr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>STREAM - Static Thermodynamic REgulAtory Model of transcription, is a bioinformatics application for researchers, who want to model the transcriptional regulation of a specific gene and predict its transcriptional output in different situations. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>IntroductionSTREAM is the first publicly available framework for modeling, visualizing, and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene. </p>

<p>Understanding transcriptional regulation of a gene in detail is a crucial step towards uncovering and ultimately utilizing the regulatory grammar of the genome. Modeling transcriptional regulation using thermodynamic equations has become an increasingly important approach towards this goal. </p>

<p>Given the concentration of a set of transcription factors as well as the transcription factor binding sites in a regulatory DNA region and the concentration of the target gene, STREAM will optimize its parameters to generate a model that best fits the input data. This trained model can then be used to </p>

<p>validate that the given set of TFs is able to regulate the target gene and predict the transcription rate under different conditions (e.g. different tissues, knockout/additional TFs or mutated/missing TFBS).  Please subscribe to the blog to stay informed about updates and papers. </p>

<p>Screenshot </p>

<p>SpecificationSTREAM is implemented in Java and is provided as an platform independet .jar file. </p>

<p>STREAM currently uses the thermodynamic model introduced by Reinitz et al.1, but the framework is flexible and can be used in conjunction with other models implemented in Java. STREAM offers several optimization methods including gradient descent and simulated annealing for adjusting the internal parameters of the model to best fit the user&#39;s input data. </p>

<p>STREAM can be executed using a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as via the command-line. The GUI offers the same functionality (e.g., multistart options of the optimization or automatic cross-validation evaluation) as the command-line tool, but in an intuitive and dialogue-based fashion. Both the command-line and the GUI version can save the current result and settings of the program into a &quot;.stream&#39;&#39; file, which makes saving and modifying previous experiments simple.  </p>

 title : The ticc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ticc (Tool for Interface Compatibility and Composition) is a tool for the prototyping and verification of distributed designs. Ticc provides the following features: </p>

<p>Modeling of design components, and of their interaction.  Each component can specify both its behavior, and the behavior it expects from other components. Modeling capabilities include shared state (via shared and private variables), one- and bi-directional communication and synchronization (via synchronization actions). Benefit: concise, natural modeling of asynchronous systems with shared state and flexible communication patterns.  Composition and compatibility checking. When components are composed, Ticc checks that they interact correctly. Ticc is capable of propagating the input constraints of components upon composition. Benefit: the consistency of the design is assured.  Simulation and Verification. Ticc can check CTL properties of designs, as well as simulate them. Ticc relies on symbolic methods for the efficient analysis of large state spaces. Benefit: the correctness of designs with respect to specifications can be checked.</p>
 summary : <p>TimMLA multi-aquifer, analytic element modelTimML is a computer program for the modeling of steady-state multi-aquifer flow with analytic elements and consists of a library of Python scripts and FORTRAN extensions. TimML may be applied to an arbitrary number of aquifers and leaky layers. The head, flow, and leakage between aquifers may be computed analytically at any point in the aquifer system. The design of TimML is object-oriented and has been kept simple and flexible. New analytic elements may be added to the code without making any changes in the existing part of the code. TimML is coded in Python, a free, open-source, powerful programming language; use is made of FORTRAN extensions to improve performance. TimML is free and open-source software and is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. </p>

<p>Download options include the TimML program and the manual. The manual contains full instructions on how to run TimML. The objective of the manual is to provide enough information for someone familiar with the analytic element method to use (and possibly modify) the program. Running TimML and especially modifying TimML requires some knowledge of Python. Python is very easy to learn. A number of free tutorials are available from the Python website. </p>

<p>TimML version 3.4 is out! TimML 3.4 has interactive graphical output that allow you to evaluate the results of your TimML model graphically and easily.  </p>

<p>Note that since version 3.3, TimML requires installation of the matplotlib and shapely packages. Detailed installation instructions are given in the manual. TimML also runs on MacOSX. A compiled FORTRAN extension can be obtained from Mark Bakker. The FORTRAN file is available under the source tab if you want to do it yourself.</p>

 title : The gfs-server Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GFS Server was born in January 2008 as a side project.  I wanted to create a socket server for Flash and Flex clients in a minimal amount of time.  Using existing projects like Apache Mina (and others) I was able to essentially glue together a socket server that worked well originally based off of the Apache Mina sample code. </p>

<p>With GFS Server you can host multi-player chat rooms and games easily. </p>

<p>Keep in mind this was a project born in my spare time and written to be up and running in very little time.  There are many sharp edges and best practices that can and should be incorporated into the code base as time permits.  In general, the code probably needs a lot of tender loving care.  I&#39;ve been asked by more than one person to open source this - so here it is. </p>

<p>This project uses several open source code from several different developers.  Unless otherwise specified the GFS Server code is licensed under the GPL 2.</p>

 summary : <p>Gperftools-httpd is a simple HTTP server, based on thttpd, that enables remote profiling via Google&#39;s pprof (see google-perftools).</p>

<p>This code is not from Google.  It is a copy of thttpd 2.25b
<br/>but then adapted to be a tiny minimal HTTP server
<br/>that can be linked into any program to serve
<br/>profiling information for pprof.</p>

<p>It has been chopped up significantly compared to the original.</p>

<p>After running make (which assumes you have the google-perftools
<br/>libraries installed in /usr/local/lib or a standard place like /usr/lib),
<br/>you can profile an arbitrary program with:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libghttpd-preload.so ./a.out</p>

<p>and then while it is running, execute:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;pprof a.out http://localhost:9999/pprof/heap</p>

<p>The preload library starts the HTTP server at the first call
<br/>to malloc.  Alternately, you can link with -lghttpd and call ghttpd()
<br/>during program initialization (e.g., in main).</p>

<p>You can change the port number by setting the environment
<br/>variable GHTTPPORT:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;GHTTPPORT=12345 LD_PRELOAD=libghttpd-preload.so ./a.out</p>

 title : The thps-decicated-server Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In the simplest sense, THPS Dedicated Server is a dedicated server for the Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater, Tony Hawk&#39;s Underground, and later series of video games. It is designed from the ground up from clean reverse engineering techniques used to understand the network code of the series by it&#39;s modding community. Currently the only way to run a multi player server for any of the series&#39;s games is to have a human player run the game and administrate it themselves. Not only that, but the included server feature set in-game is quite limited. Through the dedicated server we hope to not only allow unmanned servers, but to extend the feature set and overall multi player experience of the series. Some specific goals we have set are to not only make our server mirror the capabilities of the traditional THPS server but to greatly surpass them by integrating a powerful and flexible server scripting system. </p>

<p>The server will be written from the start to be extremely portable and to work on many platforms. We are using ANSI C and the GNU tool chain for the entirety of the project development. The server will either be reliant on WinSock or Berkeley sockets, depending on it&#39;s platform and the rest will be either original coding or functions found in the standard C runtime. The project is relatively simple and we expect to keep it very minimalistic in it&#39;s core feature set, but to make it expansible through a scripting plugin system. We haven&#39;t decided on a scripting system at this point as that is a later goal of the project, but likely candidates include Python, Lua, or a custom syntax designed by us. </p>

<p>One prospective goal may be to make our server work with multiple game platforms such as allowing Playstation 2 based players to play with PC based players. This has already been done otherwise so it is likely to be a feature of the server at a later stage of development. We also expect to allow such advanced capabilities like parsing player chat for scripting or server commands, allowing designated server administrators, permanent bans, and a wide variety of other possibilities. </p>

<p>To sum it up, we are hoping to make the online experience much greater and to utilize the true capabilities of the game&#39;s network engine by expanding it&#39;s feature set. By keeping the project open source we hope to encourage other creative ideas to enhance the multi player experience and perhaps revive a once thriving online community.</p>

 title : The ardrumo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ardrumo is completely free open source software, but to help defray the cost of Matt&#39;s drum lessons, please consider donating to the project. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>BackgroundThis is a software MIDI interface designed to accept serial data from an Arduino board and convert it into MIDI drum data in OS X.  The application acts as a bridge between sensors connected to the Arduino board and applications such as GarageBand or Logic without requiring additional MIDI hardware.  All data is transferred directly over the USB connection and no additional power source is needed. 
<br/>ConceptI wanted to make an inexpensive electronic drum setup that could be used with GarageBand.  There are some great projects out there that describe how to output MIDI from an Arduino board (see References below), but these require additional hardware (e.g. MIDI modules, MIDI interface, etc).  Since most people don&#39;t have extra MIDI hardware, I decided to just write some software to accept serial data from an Arduino board and make a virtual MIDI instrument that would be recognized by GarageBand.  Here is the idea: 
<br/> 
<br/>ImplementationMy homemade drum kit is pictured below.  Each pad is a circle of Duralar (i.e. thick mylar) sandwiched between two pieces of foam (from Pearl Art Store).  Attached to the Duralar circle is a piezo sensor extracted from its plastic casing.  Everything is then just glued together.  Each pad cost about $3.00 to make. 
<br/> 
<br/>Click on the image below to see a video of Ardrumo in action: 
<br/> 
<br/>Pad Construction
<br/>Bill of Materials
<br/>Arduino prototype board  $35 pad materials x 6 $6 piezo transducer (1500-3000Hz) x 6 (Radio Shack part #273-073) $12 Total $53 
<br/>If you can&#39;t find piezo sensors at Radio Shack, you may be able to get them from DigiKey or Jameco. Assembly Instructions
<br/> 
<br/>Wiring
<br/>The wiring is very similar to todbot&#39;s.  I borrowed his image and modified it below (hope he doesn&#39;t mind).  I didn&#39;t bother using a Zener diode as todbot suggests.  It may be safer to do so, but I haven&#39;t blown out the Arduino board yet. 
<br/> 
<br/>DownloadMac OS X Universal Application
<br/>Compatible with OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard) (see below for troubleshooting).  This also assumes you  have installed the Arduino drivers and have a working connection between your Mac and Arduino board (how else would you load the sketch below?).  If you don&#39;t have an Arduino board, you can still run the application and click the on-screen triggers to see how it works.  To use it, plug in your Ardruino board with drum triggers attached, start GarageBand (or another MIDI-compatible application), and launch Ardrumo.

 title : The aurora-mixer-drivers Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project to host native drivers for the Aurora usb audio controller. </p>

<p>StatusMixer HardwareSee http://www.auroramixer.com. </p>

<p>OS XDriver may or may not work. This was developed with a working knowledge of the FTDI serial chip and the MIDI framework for OS X. I (Joe the OS X dev) never had a unit in possession so this driver is untested. </p>

<p>Mainly, if the serial converter does not fragment the packets when sending down the USB channel, the driver should work just fine. If there is fragmentation, well, it won&#39;t work correctly at all.  </p>

<p>If fragmentation is the case, an error checker and packet buffer will have to be implemented in the recievedData method. This is trivial bcs the Aurora only send one kind of MIDI packet of fixed size. If it is ever upgraded to send SYSEX data or use MIDI Running Status messages, then it because a much more difficult problem, because of variable packet lengths and also message interruption (SYSEX&#39;s of &#39;Realtime&#39; are allowed to interrupt other messages). </p>

<p>iTiVo is free to use.  The source is available for anyone to browse and contribute to. I would appreciate bug reports in the &#39;issues&#39; tab above. 
<br/>ScreenshotsMain Page </p>

<p>Preferences Pane open, with tivo info, and formats dropdown </p>

<p>Support / FAQThere is a main help page.  Please read it and the FAQ if you&#39;re having problems.  If nothing answers your question, either post a bug report under &#39;issues&#39; above, or post to the TiVo Community forum. 
<br/>historyThis program is a continuation of the tivodecode manager program by David Benesch.  The old program was unsupported and had issues under Leopard and with Tivo3&#39;s.  However, this is not a full-time supported program.  It has many bugs, and may not do what you want.  Use at your own risk. </p>

<p>LinksUnderlying ToolsAs mentioned, iTiVo is simply a pretty front-end for a lot of tools written by other people.  Those tools (and relevant source code) are: </p>

<p>tivodecode is used to &#39;decrypt&#39; shows downloaded from the tivo. mencoder (part of the MPlayer package) is used to convert the shows to smaller files. etv-comskip is the mac port of the comskip project.  Used to figure out where the commercials are in the program. HandBrake provides an alternative encoder with its own ups and downs. t2sami is used to generate subtitles from closed caption info. </p>

<p>Other Useful ToolspyTivoX  is for doing the reverse of iTiVo (uploading or streaming any media file from your computer to your TiVo). MetaX will let you add information fields and tags (metadata) to the files you download with iTiVo.  You can add movie posters, additional useful info from imdb, or whatever. Tivo Tools Roundup maintains a long list of other tivo tools you may want to check out for your mac, including alternatives to iTiVo. TivoDecodeManager was the program from which iTiVo was derived.  It should run without issues on Tiger. If you want to view stuff you downloaded using &#39;decrypt&#39; as the format, you can try VLC, MPlayer OSX Extended (quicktime-like replacements) or Plex (a FrontRow replacement).</p>

 summary : <p>News03/11/2009:  An update is in the works to address the problem below AND get msatcommander working in OS X Snow Leopard, where it currently does not work.  This required that I rewrite the back-end code using a new GUI framework, so it was time consuming and i apologize for the delay </p>

<p>12/22/2009:  It has been reported to me that the pig-tailing of primers on the OS X platform is causing problems (i,e. no primers are being tagged).  This issue may easily be overcome by choosing NOT to pigtail primers.  If this is unacceptable, please use version 0.8.1, instead.  However, be aware that you will not benefit from bug fixes introduced in 0.8.2.  </p>

<p>I will be looking into fixing the issue shortly... </p>

<p>8/21/09:  0.8.2 binaries are in the download area.  See Changelog for fixes and an enhancement. </p>

<p>8/21/09:  New changes uploaded to SVN, updating the code (mostly for windows) to deal with Python 2.5, BioPython 1.51, and wxPython.  Additionally, added mispriming library to remove issues where microsatellite repeats were selected as proper primer binding sites. </p>

<p>FeedbackIf you have constructive feedback (likes, dislikes, enhancements), please send an email to the list-serve.  All suggestions are welcomed and will be considered.    </p>

<p>Purposemsatcommander is a python program written to locate microsatellite (SSR, VNTR, &amp;c) repeats within fasta-formatted sequence or consensus files.  msatfinder will search for all di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats (with options to search for fewer repeat types and combinations of repeat types). </p>

<p>msatcommander will also design and tag primers using primer3 as its primer design engine (see References for citations).  Many thanks to the primer3 team, in general, and Steve Rozen, in particular.  Additional information regarding primer3 may also be found on the primer3 wiki. </p>

<p>OutputFor array searching, the user may select and name a specific output file.  When searching, designing, and/or tagging primers, the user must select or create and select a directory to contain the output.  In this case, the output consists of the following: </p>

<p>Aboutmsatcommander is written in python and makes use of the biopython and wxPython modules.  msatcommander uses primer3 as its primer design engine.  Primer3 source is C and Perl.  Primer3 was written by Steve Rozen and Helen Skaletsky.  primer3_core binaries (provided within the msatcommander binaries) are built specifically for each architecture (OSX or WindowsXP).  The primer3 OSX binary is universal.</p>

 title : The omron-osx-driver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Omron has a really nice pedometer, but the software is Windows-only. I want to write a reverse-engineered USB driver. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it looks like, courtesy of Amazon:  </p>

<p>Starting points: </p>

<p>The device is model number HJ-720ITC,  Reports on USB as &#39;HHX-CABLE-USB1&#39; Product ID 0x0028, Vendor ID 0x0590 </p>

<p>Preliminary plan: Run the bundled &#39;Omron Health Management Software&#39; under VMware/Parallels, trace the USB I/O, and reverse engineer away. Given the limited features, this should be do-able. </p>

<p>Others are interested too: http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/my-favorite-pedometer-omron-hj-720itc/ </p>

<p>Current state: The code walks the USB tree, opens the Omron and gets report zero. Next step is to experiment more with report downloads and start parsing the output. I&#39;m also going to contact the company to see if they&#39;ll release any protocol information. </p>

<p>Update 5/4/09: Kyle Machulis has documented the related Omron protocol, and it&#39;s a mess. Raw HID required, due to the hackish nature, and it may never work on OSX! See </p>

<p>http://qdot.github.com/libomron </p>

<p>And the code repository at </p>

<p>http://www.github.com/qdot/libomron </p>

<p>Update 9/15/09: Kyle has added support to his library, please see http://github.com/qdot/libomron/tree/hj-720it </p>

<p>For now, this project is idle, so Kyle&#39;s code is the place to go. </p>

 summary : <p>Utilities and source code for supporting Resolution Independence in Mac OS X applications. </p>

<p>Current contentLittleYellowGuy, by Daniel Jalkut. An example of drawing images programmatically. Cocoa / Code. Available under the MIT license. Rectiffy, by Jesper. A work in production, meant to eventually be an app using which you can add multiple representations to TIFF files. Currently works as an editor that can add and remove representations and save to file, as well as a viewer. Is to be considered experimental right now, but admittedly works. Cocoa / Utility. Will be available under the BSD license. Regarding licenses and new contentAll content in this repository is licensed under the new/3-clause BSD license or, when noted, under less restrictive ones (like the MIT license or public domain). Nothing licensed purely under a more restrictive license will be accepted - a dual-licensed GPL/MIT project would be welcome, for example. </p>

 title : The usseg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>主要目标及要求实现一个针对二维超声的图像分割程序 （此尚为初步功能实现，非发布版本） </p>

<p>能够读取RAW, mhd, mha, vtk, jpeg, bmp, tif, tiff, png等多种格式2D医学图像 拥有友好的GUI，具备完善的交互操作，如选取种子点，改变窗位(右击Viewer窗口调出)等 可导出分割后图像，及相应面积数据，显示在窗口下放状态栏 实现几种分割算法，目前以Level Set系列算法为主，并且易于扩展(2008.04.02) 导出PDF格式报告，对比各种分割算法结果及统计各区域面积(2008.04.03) </p>

<p>使用说明：调取图像-&gt;在灰图选种子点(每区域2－3个较为理想)-&gt;Process </p>

<p>目前情况添加PDF格式报告导出功能，包含原始图，每钟分割算法结果图及面积。(2008.04.03) </p>

<p>添加Geodesic Active Contour, Shape Detection分割算法；经整体重构，更易于添加新算法。(2008.04.30) </p>

<p>OSX下编译完成，不过VTK的universal编译有点问题，目前仅可运行于i386架构。（2008.03.30） </p>

<p>使用ITK实现图像分割, ITKfltk2DViewer和RGBViewer实现显示及交互，VTK实现vtk格式导出, FLTK实现GUI。  </p>

<p>完成基本GUI, 2D图像读取，Canny level set算法分割及交互，分割后mask的存储。 </p>

<p>提示，可通过选多个种子点，在很大程度上提高分割质量。 </p>

<p>通过增大域值，扩大增长区域。 </p>

<p>待改进内容重构Viewer, 融入进主窗口中 最好将2DViewer和RGBViewer合并，即同时实现交互和显示overlay 实现更多算法，如Voronoi 改进输出，使之可以输出原图+overlay 2008.03.18 以FLTK作为GUI, 一来是考虑最初开发的方便，二来也兼顾多平台，将来考虑转为Qt等 面积计算 2008.03.19 算法GeodesicActiveContour添加 分割结果PDF报告导出 2008.04.03 Process后，可再加新seeds，而不用clear 2008.04.03 Temp文件储存问题 2008.04.03 不能覆盖文件问题 2008.04.04 分区域面积计算 2008.04.04 增长区域过小问题 2008.04.03 实际距离设置 2008.04.04 在图中为各区域编号，排除过大或过小区域 2008.04.30 算法Shape Detection添加 2008.04.30 编译建议见此 </p>

 title : The vidnik Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Record video segments using your iSight camera and upload them to YouTube. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Featured download; The first release of Vidnik, version 0.13.0 </p>

<p>http://vidnik.googlecode.com/svn/images/Vidnik.zip </p>

<p>Vidnik is the quickest, simplest, way to make movies using the built - in camera on your Macintosh and upload those movies to your YouTube account. </p>

<p>WARNINGI&#39;ve gotten early reports, for some people, that the movies Vidnik makes work fine on the Macintosh, but when encoded by YouTube, the sound is a fraction of a second behind the picture. I&#39;ve reproduced the problem. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking in to this. </p>

<p>Quicktime is producing MPEG-4 encoded movies with an edit list. The first displayable frame of the movie is a  b-frame, not an i-frame. Other transcoders and players, when they encounter such movies, drop the initial sequence of b-frames from the video. I&#39;m making a change to Vidnik detect that the first displayable frame is not an i-frame, and rewrite those movies, such that the first frame is an i-frame. I&#39;ll test, then upload a new version. </p>

 title : The vocito Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Vocito is a desktop UI for GrandCentral for the Mac. It allows you to easily dial anybody from your desktop. Using GrandCentral it will dial the remote phone and your local phone simultaneously, and connect you together. </p>

<p>Please note that Vocito does not work with Google Voice at this time. </p>

<p>I will update it to work with Voice as soon as I have time. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It integrates into Address Book, Quicksilver, Automater, system services, supports &quot;tel&quot; URLs, and is fully AppleScriptable.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>All this integration makes it easy to have Vocito automatically dial your phone from just about any application that supports scripting, html, or Automator actions. For example, you can easily set up your iCal meeting appointment to automatically dial the conference call for you at the correct time. </p>

<p>Vocito also allows you to save little applets that will automatically dial the phone for you with a simple double click. </p>

<p>Since GrandCentral is currently in a limited beta, we don&#39;t have any more invites to hand out right now. So those of you without a GrandCentral number don&#39;t get to play just yet, but please reserve your number now to get in on the action as soon as more invites become available. </p>

<p>Vocito is available here for download. It works on Tiger and Leopard, is both PowerPC and Intel native, and is fully open sourced. There is a discussion group at vocito-discuss on Google Groups, and an FAQ. If you need help using Vocito, check out our ever growing documentation page at VocitoHelp. If you can&#39;t find what you are looking for, please post to vocito-discuss and we&#39;ll get back to you ASAP.</p>
 title : The volturnus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Command line and graphical address book written in Python. Development is still in its early stages but all are welcome to test and provide feedback! </p>

<p>NewsDec 11, 2008 - Changes! </p>

<p>Only one change - I have switched to Mercurial and Bitbucket for my source control and hosting needs. The project is now hosted here: http://www.bitbucket.org/vansmith/volturnus/ </p>

<p>Apr. 10 2008 - Volturnus v2 </p>

<p>That&#39;s right, version 2. Version 2 is not so much an update but a remake. The GUI code and the associated CLI code have been moved into the volturnus_v1/ folder for &quot;storage&quot;. The GUI will be maintained by Richard and I will work exclusively on v2 which will be CLI focused. Thus, the project focus is now, like it was in the beginning, focused on producing a CLI address book first and then a GUI if time permits. Version 2 does not denote much new in terms of functions or concepts. The v2 code is a rewrite of v1 code as I thought the v1 code was getting a little sloppy and I saw it easier to rewrite than cleanup. In the beginning, v2 will look a lot like v1 (as v2 will be based off of v1) but it will shift dramatically as I clean up the code. In other words, it&#39;s not a rewrite from scratch. The lookup now doesn&#39;t depend on an exact match - if you are looking for &quot;Smith&quot; you don&#39;t have to search Smith, you can search &quot;smi&quot; or &quot;ith&quot; for instance. This was only a minor fix but will be one of many to come. I am hoping v2 will provide the base for a stable release. You may also notice that you input &quot;commands&quot; now to interact with contacts. For instance, if you want to delete a contact, you don&#39;t choose option &quot;b&quot;, you would type &quot;del&quot;. As a frequent user of the CLI in Linux, I appreciate commands as opposed to simply letters. There is a new snapshot available for download. It is revision 106. </p>

<p>Feb. 8 2008 - GUI design done </p>

<p>The design for the GUI is done. All focus now will be on cleaning up the code and fixing all outstanding errors.  </p>

<p>Jan. 18 2008 - New Features and Snapshot </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while but I did much less with the program over the Christmas season than I had intended (in fact, I think I did nothing). Included with this snapshot (r65) is a new import/export feature that allows you to export your db so you can import it elsewhere. The new features lack comments right now but those will be added shortly. I&#39;m more interested to see if the code works. There are still some issues with the add and delete names if someone chooses not to enter details (pushes esc). The program will not quit but errors will be reported. I want the code to be clean so these are the next priority.</p>

<p>The catalog software provides a web-interface, but no API, which prevents allowing this terrific resource to be incorporated into an automated borrowing system. </p>

<p>We at the Brown University Library have developed a Java API to Borrow-Direct that allows us to search and initiate requests to Borrow-Direct. The really nice thing about this API is that it works as a web-service, so regardless of what language you primarily code in, you can automate ISBN-based searching and requesting simply by calling this API via a url. We at the Brown Library have used this API with great success for over six months as part of our &#39;easyBorrow&#39; system, documented at: </p>

 title : The ideo-multitouch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Multitouch Package for Flash &amp; Processing by labs.ideo.com </p>

<p>Created to enable designers to explore multitouch interactions quickly and easily, this package includes all requisite software to build a lightweight multitouch system. </p>

<p>This package is comprised of two parts: </p>

<p>Multitouch Client – A multitouch API for Flash including support for extensible touch actions, arbitrarily sized displays, and a limitless number of active fingers. Software simulated touch events are also supported to allow for software to be tested and developed on computers lacking multitouch hardware. The Multitouch Client API is built in ActionScript 2 and communicates with the Multitouch Server via network socket connection. </p>

<p>Multitouch Server – There are currently two alternatives for the back-end server: </p>

<p>FTIRA camera-based computer vision system that optically recognizes multitouch input, serializing it for transmission to the Multitouch Client. It has an interactive calibration routine to effectively overcome camera alignment and fisheye lens distortion. Implemented in Processing, it uses open source libraries and Processing&#39;s net library.  </p>

<p>Originally created for use with popular low-cost DIY FTIR setups (see nuigroup for information on assembling your own FTIR hardware), this software can also be easily modified to work with commercially available systems by implementing the Multitouch Server Protocol over a socket server.  </p>

<p>WiiMoteA wiiMote based multitouch server which uses the infrared camera in the wiiMote along with hand-held IR lights to track several points. Information on building suitable light pens is available here and here and here and you can buy readymade pens here for $8.    </p>

<p>Example Code (Client) </p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to enable a movieclip to be dragged using one finger or dragged, scaled, and rotated using two fingers. The screenshot below displays this example code as applied to a colored square. </p>

<p>import com.ideo.MultiTouch.*;
<br/>import com.ideo.MultiTouch.TouchActions.*;</p>

<p>// create finger manager
<br/>var fingerManager = new FingerManager(this);</p>

<p>// connect finger manager to finger server
<br/>var fingerClient = new FingerClient(fingerManager, &quot;localhost&quot;, 11000);</p>

<p>// create finger simulator
<br/>var fingerSimulator = new FingerSimulator(fingerManager);</p>

<p>// create touch manager
<br/>var touchManager = new TouchManager(fingerManager);</p>

<p>// make movieclip touchable
<br/>touchManager.makeTouchable(myMovieClip);</p>

<p>// assign touch actions for movieclip
<br/>new OneFingerDragger(myMovieClip);
<br/>new TwoFingerManipulator(myMovieClip);Refer to the project wiki for class documentation and more sample code.  Some more complex examples of interfaces built with this package are shown in this video. </p>

<p>Multitouch Simulator </p>

<p>Touch events can be simulated in the Flash environment to allow multitouch software to be developed without or while away from multitouch hardware. Touch events are simulated by way of keyboard chording. The number keys place virtual fingerprints on the stage that can be dragged with the mouse. Visible fingerprints are also useful for debugging multitouch hardware calibration and screen registration.</p>

<p>AttentionI have made another api, for tv series. It uses the site TheTVDB.com instead of IMDb. Check it out! </p>

<p>Description:This is a simple API to access IMDb information about movies and tv series. This was developed with visual studio 2008 and the solution has two projects, the actual API, that creates a dll and a commented test project to show how to use the api. Those are available in the Source section, and now in the downloads section also. In the Downloads section, it&#39;s available the most recent version of the dll, ready to be used. In the Downloads section there is also a .chm file with the API and test project documentation.  </p>

<p>Basic functions:Searchs a movie or a tv-show by title or by ID (if the search is by ID, it loads the right page immediatly, if not, it may load the correct page or a result page with a list of several movies/tv series with that title. Gets the links of a result list page and send them to the main application, where the user must choose one. Then it parses the choosen title and send the information to the user. It allows to get the title, link to imdb, year of release, url to the cover, imdb user rate, the first of the directors, the genres, plot, info of all the actors (or the number selected) listed in the main title page (name, link to actor page, link to picture and character) and the runtime. It is possible to refresh some fields of the title, choosed by the user, without changing all of them. If you try this and come across some kind of problem, please report it to me. </p>

<p>Descrição:Isto é um API simples para aceder a informações sobre filmes e série de TV contidas no IMDb. Foi desenvolvido com o Visual Studio 2008 e a &quot;solution&quot; contém dois projectos, o API em si, que cria um dll e um projecto de teste comentado que demonstra o uso do api. Estes ficheiros estão disponíveis na secção de &quot;Source&quot; e agora também na secção de downloads. Na secção de &quot;Downloads&quot; está a versão mais recente do dll, pronta a ser utilizada. Nesta secção também se encontra um ficheiro .chm que contém a documentação do API e do projecto de teste. </p>

<p>Funções básicas:Procura filme ou séries por título ou ID (se a procura é por ID, ele vai directamente à página correspondente, senão pode ir à página correcta ou a uma página com uma lista de resultados com o título procurado. Obtem os links da página de resultados de procura e envia uma lista à aplicação principal onde o utilizador escolhe um dos resultados. Depois o api faz o parse da pagina escolhida e envia a informação à aplicação principal. As informações que podem ser obtidas são: o título original, o link para IMDb, ano de lançamento, url para a capa, pontuação IMDb, o 1º realizador, géneros, sinopse, informação sobre todos os actores (ou só os primeiros &quot;x&quot; que decidir) listados na página normal do título (nome, link para a pagina, link para a foto e personagem desempenhada) e o tempo de duração. É possível actualizar alguns dos campos, escolhidos pelo utilizador, sem alterar os outros. Se experimentar este software e encontrar algum erro ou bug, por favor informe-me. </p>

 title : The javabook Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewFacebook provides a Java-based API, but I wanted a slightly different API for a few reasons: </p>

<p>The Facebook Java API returns org.w3c.Document for calls, which is quite a pain to work with. I prefer using JSON. Javabook uses json-lib, which is a good JSON library that is getting better by the month. It provides conveniences for JSON-&gt;Java bean mapping. The Facebook Java API uses the JDK&#39;s HTTP client, which is quite poor. The Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClient that Javabook uses is a much better. I wanted to incorporate logging and request latency measurement. Javabook uses Apache Jakarta Commons Logging, which integrates nicely with many Java people&#39;s existing logging infrastructure. I prefer to turn certain exceptions (such as invalid sessions) into specific exceptions that can be caught and handled by the application. I prefer separating the APIs for session-based and non-session-based Facebook methods into separate classes. While the Facebook Java API is open source, there&#39;s not an obvious community process by which contributions can be incorporated. I wanted something that could be a Maven package. </p>

<p>None of these are criticisms--I find the Facebook Java API generally well coded; I just have different requirements. </p>

<p>Javabook LimitationsThe Javabook client API is only for Web-based applications. Desktop applications cannot use this API, at least right now. The Javabook client API does not include all the read methods that the Facebook API does, as nearly all data can be requested through FQL. The Javabook API requires you to write FQL. The API is currently missing a number of methods, like dealing with photo albums. The API is mostly for Facebook applications that use FBML rather than iframes and applications that aren&#39;t using the Facebook platform. Quick StartHere&#39;s how you can make an FQL query for a user given an auth key (e.g., one that you receive from the FB login procedure). </p>

<br/>      String secret = &quot;&quot;; // YOUR SECRET</p>

<p>      // Just create one of these for your app/process
<br/>      FacebookRpcClient fbRpcClient = new FacebookRpcClient(apiKey, secret);</p>

<p>      // You just need one of these for your app, too
<br/>      FacebookClient fbClient = new FacebookClient(fbRpcClient);</p>

<p>      String authToken = &quot;&quot;; // an auth token you&#39;ve received
<br/>      
<br/>      // creates a session from the auth token
<br/>      FacebookSession session = fbClient.createSessionKeyForAuthToken(authToken);
<br/>      FacebookSessionClient fbSessionClient = new FacebookSessionClientImpl(App.getServer().getFacebookRpcClient(), session);</p>

<p>      JSONObject obj = fbSessionClient.queryForObject(&quot;select first_name from user where uid=&quot; + session.getUid());</p>

<p>      String name = obj.getString(&quot;first_name&quot;);</p>

 title : The photobucket-api-php5 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library, though developed by Photobucket developers, is not supported by Photobucket, and is distributed with The MIT License, provided as-is for you to use. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Implements the request format as shown in the examples. This is &#39;fluent&#39; syntax and provides a very readable structure. Supports multiple request methods: curl, fopen wrappers and fsockopen, with an extensible model to add new strategies in the future. Curl and fopen wrappers are not supported on every host, so I thought I would provide a few different alternatives. Those users behind proxies may want to create a derivative of one of the strategies provided to request through the proxy. Alternately, a new request strategy using the PEAR HTTP_Request could be built. Supports multiple response formats and parses them to local PHP data structures. Most of the time one would use just the PHP array serialization format, but in the event you really want to use one of the other methods, for whatever reason, those methods are available. Exceptions thrown by the server are turned into Exceptions in the library through the response parsers. Packaged as PEAR packages, but you can extract the .tgz files or check out the code and use without PEAR. </p>

<p>This library is coupled with the OAuth library also hosted on this site, which implements a relatively strict version of the OAuth spec. Both packages should be used. </p>

<p>PEAR packages will be built from the code in the branches (with corresponding version numbers), if there are changes.  For example, PBAPI-0.1 is built from the branches/release-0.1 branch.  Trunk code is potentially unstable, but usage of this line could provide valuable feedback.</p>

 summary : <p>OverviewWe just wouldn&#39;t be a true Web 2.0 company if we didn&#39;t have an API now would we? The main reason for creating the API was so that vendors could manage their shirts in our index after an approval process, but we thought it&#39;d be fun to open up access to our entire index. You can search shirts by keyword and tag, look up tags, etc. from the API. What use is this to you? We have no idea, but we&#39;re looking forward to finding out! </p>

<p>All queries to the API are sent via an HTTP GET with the exception of all of the vendor endpoints, which required an HTTP POST along with a standard HTTP-Auth username and password. All queries to the API are sent over SSL. </p>

<p>Install PEAR Package$ pear install http://pleasedressme.googlecode.com/files/Services_PleaseDressMe-0.0.1.tgzShirtsSearchThe search endpoint allows you to search the tshirt index and return a list of shirts that match the search criteria. The only argument is q and should be the query you wish to search for. </p>

<p>https://pleasedress.me/api/1.0/shirts/search.xml?q=jerryTagThe tags endpoint allows you to find tshirts by tag. It also allows you to find shirts by color since colors are just tags on a shirt. The only argument is tag and should be the tag you wish to find shirts by. </p>

<p>http://pleasedress.me/api/1.0/shirts/search.xml?q=blueTagsLetterThe letter endpoint lets you find tags that begin with the letter specified. This endpoint returns the tag, number of shirts tagged with that tag and the URL to view all shirts tagged with that tag. The letter expected is a through z or 0 through 9. </p>

<p>http://pleasedress.me/api/1.0/tags/h.xmlVendorsAll requests to vendor endpoints must be sent via SSL and use HTTP-Auth to authenticate via a POST request. Use your login email and password to access the API. You may only add shirts, which are then put in a pending queue for review and tagging, remove shirts or flush their information/image from cache.</p>

<p>The communication between the client and the server is specified on general level. It allows to use this library for solving the most of the possible tasks, not losing in efficiency. </p>

<p>The library works with four main concepts: client, server, servant and connection. Client sends requests to a server. For each request the server creates special object - servant, that serves this request. To have multi-threading behavior and to handle all communication specific details the connection object is used as wrapper around servant object.</p>

So is it going to take longer to download the pages that included with the JS file? No, it won&#39;t, because the file is so small - less than 800 bytes.</p>

 title : The wikixmlj Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>(Part of the larger WikiSense project aimed at understanding Wikipedia for semantic annotation of texts) </p>

<p>WikiXMLJ provides easy access to Wikipedia XML dumps. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Easy access to important elements of a Wikipedia page Also provides interfaces for Wiki text parsing. Memory efficient SAX interface for parsing Lazy loading of files for DOM Callback support with DOM Directly operate on compressed wikipedia dumps (gzip/bzip2/native xml supported) Note: gzip streams are way faster than bzip2 for a slight trade off in space. </p>

<p>DOMParser Example: </p>

<p>import edu.jhu.nlp.wikipedia.*;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>	WikiXMLParser wxp = WikiXMLParserFactory.getDOMParser(args[0]);
<br/>	try {
<br/>		wxp.parse();
<br/>		WikiPageIterator it = wxp.getIterator();
<br/>		while(it.hasMorePages()) {
<br/>			WikiPage page = it.nextPage();
<br/>			System.out.println(page.getTitle());
<br/>		}</p>

<p>	}catch(Exception e) {
<br/>		e.printStackTrace();
<br/>	}SAXParser Example: </p>

<p>import edu.jhu.nlp.wikipedia.*;</p>

<p>...
<br/>	WikiXMLParser wxsp = WikiXMLParserFactory.getSAXParser(args[0]);
<br/>		
<br/>	try {
<br/>		  
<br/>	    wxsp.setPageCallback(new PageCallbackHandler() { 
<br/>                           public void process(WikiPage page) {
<br/>		                  System.out.println(page.getTitle());
<br/>	                   }
<br/>            });
<br/>		
<br/>	   wxsp.parse();
<br/>	}catch(Exception e) {
<br/>		e.printStackTrace();
<br/>	}Notes: </p>

<p>1. The DOM parser is known to run out of memory despite of lazy loading the DOM tree for very large Wikipedia dumps (like English). This issue will be fixed eventually until then using the SAX parser interface is highly recommended. If you really want to use the DOM parser, try it with the callback interface.  </p>

<p>2.This should not be confused with the Java Wikipedia Parser that converts wiki-text to HTML.  </p>

 title : The barrio Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Active development in this project has ceased. However, some of the ideas of Barrio are now addressed in our new project, gql4jung.  </p>

<p>Barrio is a dependency analyzer for object-oriented programs implemented in Java. It discovers and visualizes community structures in the dependency graph which might represent opportunities to refactor the program into a more modular structure. For instance, a package containing two independent clusters could be split, and the new packages could be deployed in separate jar files. Barrio will also detect if there are few   dependencies that destroy the modularity of programs (i.e., glue clusters together). </p>

<p>For more information, see  </p>

<p>Dietrich, J., Yakovlev, V., Mccartin, C., Jenson, G., and Duchrow, M. 2008. Cluster analysis of Java dependency graphs. In Proceedings of the 4th ACM Symposium on Software Visualization (Ammersee, Germany, September 16 - 17, 2008). Softvis08. ACM, New York, NY, 91-94. DOI: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1409720.1409735 </p>

<p>The following figure shows the dependency graph of the classes in the Apache Commons Collection library analysed with the barrio Eclipse plugin. The blue and red regions show clusters and explicitly defined packages. The large package on the left side of the graph contains several clusters, and could therefore be split.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Barrio is designed as an Eclipse plugin. Barrio has the following features: </p>

<p>Barrio can import dependency graphs stored as ODEM files (these graphs can be generated with CDA from bytecode). Barrio can also extract the graph from project source code. Graphs extracted from source code can be exported back to ODEM files. Barrio can apply filters to the graph. Barrio can visualize the graph. Visualization is based on Prefuse. Barrio can find clusters in the graph based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm. The Jung implementation of the algorithm is used. Barrio allows users to set a separation level in order to remove edges destroying the modularity of the program. Those edges might present refactoring opportunities. The discovered clusters are compared with the modular structure of the program (i.e., the use of packages and jar containers). Barrio can be used to define stereotypes based on rules. For instance, UI classes can be defined as classes referencing the java.awt package. UsageThe software is distributed using the Eclipse Update mechanism. The update site is http://barrio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/barrio.update/ . Please check from time to time for new versions. The plugin requires Eclipse version 3.3 or better! Once installed, you will need some input data. You can download a zip file containing sample data from the download section, or create data for your own project using the CDA tool.  Planned featuresDetection of motifs (patterns) in the graph using a declarative graph query language.</p>

 summary : <p>clustelA java implementation of a grid based clustering algorithm intended for clustering points on maps.  </p>

<p>The project evolved from the need to cluster hundreds of points to avoid overloading the browser and user with overlapping and unnecessary points at lower zoom levels. </p>

<p>how it worksBeginning with a single cluster it recursively divides clusters until the maximum number of clusters is reached or the minimum scale is reached. It determines which cluster to next subdivide by applying a cluster index.  The cluster index is simply the area of the cluster mulitplied by the scale of the cluster (relative to the initial cluster size). </p>

 title : The cougarcluster Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Code for producing clusters of data for the Eastern Slopes Cougar Project., </p>
 summary : <p>Information retrieval is a traditional application for computers that has become even more prominent with the advent of the World Wide Web. The process of retrieving content from a text corpus (collection of text files) is normally managed by analyzing the text files to produce an index, and then having a separate query engine that uses the index to retrieve the desired text from its source files. For Project 5, queries will retrieve documents instead of lines. Hence, the structure of the index file and the kind of analysis used to construct it will differ somewhat from that of Projects 3 and 4. Other differences will include the kinds of queries allowed and the user interface.</p>

<p>For this project, the analysis tool is called DTI (pronounced ditty and standing for Document-Term Indexer), and the query tool is called RABID (Retriever and Browse Indexed Documents).</p>

 title : The ctypes-opencv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ctypes-opencv is a package that brings Willow Garage&#39;s (formerly Intel&#39;s) Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to Python. OpenCV is a collection of algorithms and sample code for various computer vision problems. The goal of ctypes-opencv is to provide Python access to all documented functionality of OpenCV.  </p>

<p>Advantages   </p>

<p>Complete interface to OpenCV&#39;s CXCORE, CV, HighGUI components. Pythonic interface. OpenCV&#39;s objects are safely deleted when not used. No need to invoke cvRelease...(). Pure Python package. Neither C/C++ compiler nor OpenCV&#39;s source code is needed. Support for both versions 1.0 and 1.1pre1 of OpenCV. Cross platform, running on any OS that OpenCV can be installed, including: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Ability to convert between OpenCV&#39;s arrays (CvMatND, CvMat, and IplImage) and arrays used in wxWidgets, NumPy, PyGTK, and PIL. </p>

<p>Disadvantage   </p>

<p>No support for OpenCV&#39;s ML component yet. This is a limitation of the current ctypes package. The ML component contains mostly C++ classes. ctypes at the moment cannot wrap C++ classes and their member functions. This limitation will be overcome in the future. A new Python wrapper using Boost.Python and NumPy has been under development. </p>

<br/>}Related Python wrappers for OpenCVOpenCV has its own swig-based Python wrapper. However, it has conflicts in memory management between C/C++ and Python, and hence is not suitable for large projects. It is also particularly hard to maintain and develop.  </p>

<p>Another project called CVtypes was pioneered by Michael Otto and is currently maintained by Gary Bishop (at http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/wp/blog/2007/02/04/python-opencv-wrapper-using-ctypes/). The wrapper is based on ctypes. It supports a large set of OpenCV&#39;s functions and a limited set of OpenCV&#39;s structures.  </p>

<p>I used to provide some improvements to CVtypes here and there. While Gary Bishop was a kind professor, I felt not so nice to keep asking him to update his code. Therefore, I decided to branch from his CVtypes, and the result is this project. ctypes-opencv supports a fairly complete set of OpenCV&#39;s structures and functions. More importantly, I have put a lot of efforts in making ctypes-opencv faster, better memory-managed, and easier to use, by not only adopting but also improving the pythonic interface introduced by OpenCV&#39;s developers. Nevertheless, credits should also go to OpenCV developers, and CVtypes&#39; authors and contributors. I intend to eventually merge back to Gary Bishop&#39;s CVtypes when the project is mature enough. </p>

 title : The dblp-expert-finder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewAn Expert Finder System for DBLP.  Extends the ACM Computing Classification System to build a hierarchy of expertise areas.  Associates experts with areas of expertise in this extended taxonomy. </p>

<p>This work is a part of Philip Fisher-Ogden&#39;s Master&#39;s Thesis at UC Davis.  Professors Michael Gertz and Ian Davidson are the thesis advisors for this research. </p>

<p>Primary GoalsExpertise areas: synthesize associations between topics and experts, enabling expertise identification for a given topic or a given researcher. Taxonomy: extend an existing taxonomy to produce an exploratory interface to browse for experts in. Contributions1. We augment the information in DBLP with enough additional data to be able to make a judgment on expertise areas and experts for a given area. </p>

<p>2. We address the problem of topic extraction by leveraging existing author-generated metadata to build a light weight controlled vocabulary. </p>

<p>3. We propose an exploratory interface for finding experts that utilizes an extended form of a well known taxonomy combined with spatio-temporal visualizations of each node&#39;s document sets. </p>

<p>MilestonesBuilding an expert finder system for DBLP requires reaching the following milestones: </p>

<p>Create an object/domain model for the DBLP data and load the DBLP XML data into a database.  (Leverage JAXB and JPA technologies to do this) Create an object model for the ACM Computing Classification System taxonomy and load the XML version of that taxonomy into a database.  (Leverage JAXB and JPA technologies to do this) Extract classification information, general terms, keywords, and abstracts for each DBLP entry and associate that information with each DBLP entry in a database. Associate topics in the extended taxonomy with researchers that have published on each topic. Provide an interface to allow users to identify experts for a given topic, where the topic is an element in the extended taxonomy. Identify communities of expertise. Evaluate various spatio-temporal visualizations for the exploratory interface. </p>

<p>Related WorkFaceted DBLP allows users to browse the DBLP data using keyword searches and faceted navigation.  It also allows users to automatically generate categories from their search results by using the Semantic GrowBag algorithm LinksFor a current list of links related to this effort, see my thesis links on delicious.</p>
 title : The detecting-repeated-shapes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This program attempts to detect repeated shapes in images, using segmentation and hierarchical agglomerative clustering of image segments. The program was developed in the hope that this would be a useful adjunct to developing content based image recognition. </p>

<p>As a more practical matter, the code can create attractive image transformations. </p>

<p>More information on the original project, including samples, is located at my website.  </p>

<p>The abstract follows: </p>

<p>An important visual capability is the ability to quickly detect the presence of multiple similar shapes in an image. We seek a fast method to either determine that no repeated objects are in a image, or to determine that there are repeated objects and identify them. We term this the perceptual clustering property. We segment an image and present a heuristic for the similarity between image segments, and then cluster segments. For segmentation we use the fast MST-based image segmentation presented by Felzenszwalb &amp; Huttenlocher. We define a metric space for segments based on simple per-segment measures including color, size, rough shape etc. Over this space we cluster using a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm based on shortest distance between clusters. The running time is dominated by the segmentation algorithm, which is itself quite fast; run times are on the order of one second for 240×320 images. We find that our clustering does indeed capture the perceptual clustering property for a wide variety of images.  </p>

<p>The code is in C. Originally written in 2004, I am updating the code to be based on Felzenszwalb&#39;s new code release of December 2006. The initial repository tag is of Felzenszwalb&#39;s segmentation code.</p>

 title : The erlinda Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Vision StatementProvide a high level framework for developing high performance applications that can scale linearly with higher resources. </p>

<p>AbstractWe live in the world where Moore&#39;s law and Von Neumann&#39;s model of programming will soon be obsolete. As Dr. Dobb&#39;s article http://www.ddj.com/web-development/184405990;jsessionid=0LJW3X4MBU5TSQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?_requestid=131749 on &quot;Free Lunch is over&quot; indicated we will have to adjust in this world. Fortunately, parallel programming field has been dealing with this for several decades and there are plenty of solutions available. Unfortunately, most of them are still very research oriented and difficult to use in the real world. I wrote similar system called JavaNOW several years ago as a research project in Java that I will port to Erlang. I plan to leverage concurrency capability of Erlang language and its supported libraries such as OTP and provide a framework for writing high performance applications. Though, Erlang is concurrent language and OTP provides sophisticated support for writing fault tolerant services and provides high availability (with hot code swaps), but it does not inherently support writing parallel applications. Erlinda fill in that gap and provide abstraction to write high performance applications. It is built on top of Erlang and OTP and uses RabbitMQ for messaging middleware. </p>

<p>IntroductionErlinda provides a framework for writing parallel applications. It provides a number of abstractions for creating parallel applications such as: </p>

<p>Tuple Space model based on Linda memory model (JavaSpaces) MPI like APIs for communication (Scatter/Gather) Map/Reduce Master/Slave (Computing Farm) Service oriented (OTP) Clustering Agents and Mobililty Messaging oriented (Queues/Topics) Service/Resource discovery mechanism (similar to JINI) Integration with other languages and middlewares Code Server (similar to JINI/RMI) Security </p>

Any feedback or suggestions is greatly appreciated.</p>

 title : The h2osgi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Enable deployment of the H2 Database in OSGi containers.  </p>

<p>What is the value in this? I&#39;m still looking at different scenarios. Here&#39;s what I have so far: </p>

<p> H2 is nearly 3x faster in embedded mode. But in this mode it is available only to the application that launched it. As an OSGi service, H2 and any db instance becomes available to as many OSGi applications or services as you want, in-VM...with run-time deployment. This is very compelling. Additionally, the database can be run in  mixed mode (embedded and vi TCP/IP) so that standard SQL tools and processes can connect over the network.  We&#39;ll see OSGi versions of java databases like we do with http servers, j2ee servers, etc. With this model, I can choose to embed the database in my application code or just deploy it as a service that other services listen for and use.  H2 functionality (services) can be mixed and matched as needed rather than as one monolithic deployment. This cuts down on deployment footprint and opens the door for 3rd party value-add services. For example, here is how H2 might be service-ized: </p>

<p>H2 Core Service (Memory and Embedded) Remote Service(s), http, ftp, other Lucene Service Web, Shell, Swing/JFX/GUI Admin Services Replication/Clustering Services Persistence Manger for JPA or JDO drop-in services App Specific Services Status (6/2/08): I have successfully wrapped and launched H2 as an OSGi service and will post the code when the project is more organized.  </p>

<p>Status (1/3/09): After job change and move I&#39;m finally back to it. I&#39;ve uploaded code for a concept proof. Using mvn you can package a ConsoleService-xyz.jar file. It&#39;s a bundle that can be installed into an ipojo-enabled osgi container (Felix). Or you can just download the .jar file since I&#39;ve included the target directory as well with this commit. Basic stuff but it&#39;s a start. Also checkout the powerpoint in the /doc directory. Next step is to decide a reasonable way to segment osgi into bundles while keeping in sync with the main development line. Suggestions and participation welcome...Erik</p>

 summary : <p>This summarization system, crafted for the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) evaluation campaign, generates summaries by extracting sentences that contain the most frequent word bigrams (called concepts) from the input documents. It uses Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for determining, under a length constraint that set of sentences. With this system, we obtained very good scores for the update task at the TAC&#39;08 evals and among the best scores at TAC&#39;09. </p>

<p>So far, we only released the raw code which contains a lot of dependencies to internal stuff at ICSI, but we plan to add a cleaned-up, standalone version for public use. </p>

<p>NEWS: </p>

 title : The linloglayout Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewLinLogLayout is a simple program for computing graph layouts (positions of graph nodes in two- or three-dimensional space) and graph clusterings. It reads a graph from a file, computes a layout and a clustering, writes the layout and the clustering to a file, and displays them in a dialog. LinLogLayout can be used to identify groups of densely connected nodes in graphs, like communities of friends or collaborators in social networks, related documents in hyperlink structures (e.g. web graphs), cohesive subsystems in software systems, etc. With a change of a parameter in the main method, it can also compute classical &quot;nice&quot; (i.e. readable) force-directed layouts. </p>

<p>The program is primarily intended as a demo for the use of its core layouter and clusterer classes MinimizerBarnesHut, MinimizerClassic, and OptimizerModularity.  While MinimizerBarnesHut is faster, MinimizerClassic is simpler and not limited to a maximum of three dimensions. </p>

<p>LinLogLayout optimizes LinLog and related energy models to compute layouts, and Newman and Girvan&#39;s Modularity to compute clusterings.  For more information about LinLog and Modularity, see </p>

<p>A. Noack. Energy Models for Graph Clustering, Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, 11(2):453-480, 2007. M. E. J. Newman. Analysis of Weighted Networks, Physical Review E, 70:056131, 2004. A. Noack. Modularity Clustering is Force-Directed Layout, Physical Review E, 79:026102, 2009. </p>

<p>UsageUsage: java LinLogLayout    computes a -dimensional layout and a clustering for the graph in , writes the layout and the clustering into , and displays (the first 2 dimensions of) the layout and the clustering.  must be 2 or 3. </p>

<p>Input file format: Each line represents an edge and has the format   , where the weight is optional and defaults to 1.0. </p>

<p>Output file format:      </p>

<p>Example: java -cp bin LinLogLayout 2 examples/WorldImport1999.el WorldImport1999.lc </p>

<p>Example </p>

<p>The screenshot shows a layout and a clustering of the world trade graph, where the nodes represent countries, and the edge weight of each node pair specifies the trade volume between the corresponding countries.  Both the layout (node positions) and the clustering (node colors) group the countries of the three major economic areas East Asia / Australia, America, and Europe.  The layout also reflects that countries like IRN and EGY are rather between the East Asian and the European group, and shows many smaller groups like CHN and HKG, AUS and NZL, and GBR and IRL.</p>

 title : The majimock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MajiMock is a toolkit to help you write unit tests for Java code. Its primary focus is to help developers generate and use mock implementations of Java interfaces and classes in their unit tests, but it includes several other useful features. </p>

<p>MajiMock helps you to: </p>

<p>Generate mock implementations of interfaces and classes on the fly in test code. Express expected interactions between the code under test and mock objects, and later verify that the interactions have occurred. MajiMock provides a record-replay style API for defining expectations. Express constraints using predicate objects and make assertions about whether predicates hold true for objects under test. The predicates can be used quite separately from mock objects. Test asynchronous code. Again, this can be used separately or in conjunction with mock objects. Write JUnit tests. MajiMock provides a number of utility classes and fixtures commonly used to write JUnit test cases.</p>

 title : The moduleeval Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Gene lists can be partitioned by their expression profiles, cis-regulatory information and other features.  Here we explore and develop existing methods for the functional evaluation of those partitioned groups.  When the features of a group are both cis-regulatory and expression gene signature data, then they are considered cis-regulatory modules (CRE).   </p>

<p>One generally accepted method uses counts of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and determines statistical significance based on the hypergeometric distribution (Cho et al, 2001).  There are similar methods based on the binomial distribution, chi-squared test for equal proportions (Fisher et al, 1993) and the Fisher&#39;s exact test (Man et al, 2000).  Another method based on information content and the graphic nature of GO was implimented by Speer et al, 2005.  Additionally, there are several Bayesian methods.        </p>

 summary : <p>AbstractThe android platform provides the ability to geo-locate data easily and at all times. The potential list of applications that can use such location aware data is endless. Topophilia is a pluggable framework for location aware data. It enables applications/modules to query for location aware clusters (a center point and radius) and enables the user a central UI for most location aware applications. </p>

<p>MotivationGeolocated information will be one of the most interesting field within the forthcoming mobile market. The ability to generate geobased data in real time and space gives the ability to create endless applications. Such application will affect the way we live and interact. The android challenge showed a majority of submitted application being geolocated. Each generating different data with the singularity of being geolocated. The idea of topophilia was born out of it. Being able to group the data generated from several applications within a single framework - and map overlay. Users will be able to see all geo data on a single map and have a good view of different information coming from different application. </p>

<p>Geoaware data should be kept private while enabling mining and clustering. Topophilia will be released under LGPL and will provide a transparent framework. We don&#39;t want to use the data in other means then social mapping. Its final aim will be to provide and open and transparent framework (both android based and web based).    </p>

<p>Module exampleA photo application might take geolocate the position of the picture. Such application will suit idealy to topophilia. Its integration would be closed to fully. </p>

<p>Another example is a navigation system. The navigation system might not require to display all data within Topohilia. The application might want to just displayed saved routes or favorite routes.  </p>

<p>The list of modules can be found here. </p>

<p>A wishlist of modules can be found here. </p>

<p>If you have created a module, send an email to ... and we will add it to the above list </p>

<p>Technical information and future evolutionThe aim of topophilia is to link and cluster the data together. Topophilia is not intended to generate any information on its own. It will cluster data from other applications - called modules - and enable modules to be &#39;aware&#39; of other applications. For instance you will be able to query for any modules with the following uri: </p>

<p>content://topophilia/modsThe main aim of topophilia is to map the geo data to a user defined place. For instance, a user living in London will most likely define a place called london against which to cluster data. A place is defined by its center (latitude and longitude) and its radius. You can query for all user defined places with the following uris: </p>

<p>content://topophilia/placesThe following will give all modules that generated some information for that place - in this case london: </p>

<p>content://topophilia/places/london/modsIf you want to get the data generated by a module for a specific place, you would use: </p>

 summary : <p>创业成功的七个必要条件　　团队：共同认可的理念+专属技能+性格合拍的人。理念就不多说了，没有统一的目标最好不要创业，不然到后面还是以分裂告终。技术是网站的基础，如果技术很薄弱，最好也不要创业，否则除了不能将理念完全表达、延误项目进度外，失去对于初创最重要的时间，就意味着机会和成本的失去。技术最好有个比较强的架构师，产品是网站的核心，你未来要怎么发展基本就看构架了。市场是初创期重要的角色，除非你不想让别人知道你们的存在，有业内媒体资源的人是必须的，如果没有，现在开始培养也来得及。团队成员性格要合拍，至少在初期是必要的，没有必要把时间花在内耗上，最好是有过一段时间配合过的朋友。 </p>

<p>　　产品：价值+创新。我们在做一个产品的时候，考虑的就是它的价值，对于用户的价值是什么，商业价值是什么。对于互联网创业我更愿意看作是一种创造性的工作，我们在创造新的事物、创造一种新的服务，或者改变了提升了现有服务，让用户的体验更好。同时我们所创造的商业价值，要明白迎合哪些人。创业是为了创造商业价值，如果你不清楚商业出口在哪里，未来谁为你的创业买单？你还需要考虑，产品的差异化，不要和巨头去竞争。 </p>

<p>　　用时间去经营心态。时间是检验项目成功与否的根本条件，创业不是半年一年的事，需要用心去经营。创业将会面对很多困难，很多时候对内心而言是种煎熬，坚持未必胜利，但放弃必然失败。做企业是困难的，它需要经历几个阶段，第一步需要开发及完善，第二步需要巩固用户，第三步需要将用户积累到一定规模，第四步也许才是尝试性的商业探索，第五步也许才是真正的规模商业模式发展，然后继续发展，扩大规模。这些都需要时间，这些都需要平稳的心态稳步去经营，任何一个行业都无法改变商业的本质，商业的规则是恒定不变的，浮躁的心态只能揠苗助长，最终无所收获，包括投资的急功近利。 </p>

<p>　　资金。初创期需要必要的资金，至少你知道这笔钱可以让你的项目走向一定的轨道，这笔资金的来源更应该来自团队内部，如果你的钱不足以支持必要的发展，那最好不要创业，否则只能是浪费时间和金钱。项目到了一定程度，投资是必要的，但是遇到短视和投机的投资者，创业者就要格外小心，因为投资而毁掉项目发展的案例不计其数。融资是创业者和投资者博弈的过程，需要平起平坐，包括对人格、心态、价值的相互认可。 </p>

<p>　　适度的工作经验。世界上非常成功的互联网公司80%的创业者创业年龄小于30岁。同时90%的大学生创业会失败。所以适度的工作经验是必要的，它更多考验的是创业者对未来无法预测事物的敏感度和判断力，往往正是因为这种凭感觉的决策决定了创业的成功与否。同时很多职业素养也是在工作中磨砺出来。 </p>

<p>　　推动项目发展的必须资源。比如你要做个购物或商务社区，对于这个项目发展的必须资源可能是：某个领域的意见领袖、某类产品的销售渠道、潜在的合作伙伴、社区传播的营销渠道、具有高端客户资源的传媒公司等等。如果你的资源范围内不具备必要的资源，那么很有可能在发展到一定阶段的时候，会非常缓慢甚至被后起之秀超越。没有资源的人往往为他人做嫁衣，除非你的产品优秀到VC没有选择。 </p>

<p>　　营销的传播通路、口碑。初创期的企业，难有足够的实力去推广项目，也没有足够的市场预算，所以需要巧妙的借势而行，调动web2.0的口碑力量。在这个互联网眼球经济的时代，曝光度也会决定项目一定的价值含量。如果你可以整合一些资源帮助传播的网站，借用blogger口碑的力量，联合一些低成本传播的群体，或者人脉关系的媒体资源，都能够大大推动项目的市场工作，行之有效而且成本很低。初创企业需要懂得以小博大的道理。 </p>

<p>　　也许如此合拍的人有缘分在一起合作就是多么的一种幸福，无论如何的风险，无论如何的结果，这段因为共同奋斗而多彩的经历也会让我们感到人生中多了一座曾经胜利的里程碑！ </p>

 summary : <p>SummaryZenPDB is a Python module to process and analyze macromolecular structures. Macromolecular structures are represented as hierarchically nested python dictionaries, which allows to traverse and manipulate them in a pythonic way and implement structural biology algorithms compactly. This module is also useful to establish processing pipelines. ZenPDB is currently capable of parsing and writing PDB files, but PDBML input is also planned. </p>

<p>ZenPDB provides fast and versatile Cython implementations of important algorithms in structural biology, namely accessible surface area (ASA) and distance contact calculations by using kd-trees for nearest neighbour look-up. It is crystallography-aware and can construct crystal lattices, unit cells and biological units. </p>

 summary : <p>On a debian like system, scan_network is a little tool running during the bootup process to dynamically generate the interfaces file. It targets on aiming mobile users who have static ip settings, wifis, and different networks around but painful to all of these into interfaces file since whenever you have a static info in interfaces file, the boot process just waits forever to get over it when you are NOT in that env anymore. Instead of writing those configuration info into interfaces, you write to scan_network profile files and then you can just leave the rest of things to scan_network. It will probe the right ip setting for you when you are in a certain network env and ignore those aren&#39;t going to work. No wait on boot time!</p>

 summary : <p>This program is a network monitor. </p>

<p>Skipole-Monitor allows the user to input host IP addresses, it then regularly pings these hosts and displays their status via a built-in web server. It can optionally send email alerts and syslog messages if the hosts change status. </p>

<p>So calling http://your_pc_address:8000 will display pages showing green, yellow or red host or group symbols. </p>

<p>Each host is pinged four times every interval (default five minutes), and symbols are displayed as: </p>

<p>green  : if three or four pings are successful 
<br/>yellow : if only one or two are successful 
<br/>red    : if all four fail 
<br/>As well as hosts, group symbols are displayed, and can be opened to show hosts, or sub-groups nested within. The operator can create groups, and sub-groups via the gui. </p>

<p>It has been tested on Windows XP and Linux platforms. </p>

<p>Windows users; to install, download and run skipolemonitor_0_80_py25_install.exe </p>

<p>Linux users; a tar file of Python source code is available in the downloads section. You will also need WxPython and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) which are used to provide the gui and graphing functions. See the Wiki for details. </p>

 title : The ambienthackystat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PurposeThe AmbientHackystat project is, at its essence, a system of alerts that lets a development team be aware of the status of their project at all times. But instead of blaring alarms whenever a build fails or annoying pop ups that can distract a developer while he&#39;s on a roll, the AmbientHackystat project uses ambient devices that unobtrusively reminds a developer of the current state of the project. These devices simply change color or move around a little when a build fails or if unit tests are not passing.  </p>

<p>The AmbientHackystat project is a offshoot of the Hackystat project. Where the Hackystat project aims to gather information from developers through sensors installed on the developer&#39;s computer and tries to make sense of that data, the AmbientHackystat project takes that same data, which we call &quot;Triggers,&quot; and links them to &quot;Actions&quot; that are carried out by a Ambient Device such as the Ambient Orb or the Nabaztag Bunny. This &quot;Trigger/Action Pair&quot; is the core of the AmbientHackystat project.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a screen shot of our program in action (command line version): </p>

<p> </p>

<p>CapabilitiesCurrently, we have two types of Triggers that we can use and two different ambient devices that carry their own set of actions. The type of triggers that we have available are SensorData Triggers and Coverage Triggers. SensorData triggers can take the data from QA tools such as !JUnit, CheckStyle and PMD and assign a threshold value to it. The value could be something easy as passing a build or CheckStyle check or you could bundle a couple triggers together to create complicated triggers.  </p>

<p>As for Actions, we have two ambient devices currently interfaced into our server, the Ambient Orb and the Nabaztag Bunny. The Ambient Orb has the ability to change its color and its animation in reaction to a trigger. The Bunny on the other hand can move its ears and convert text into speech in reaction to a trigger.  </p>

 title : The ambienthackystat-ui-wicket Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a web application interface using wicket for the AmbientHackystat project.  The user interface is adapted from the Hackystat-ui-wicket project by Dr. Philip Johnson. </p>

<p>PurposeThe ambient server, at its current state, can only be run from the command line because it has no user interface. This also creates implications with editing the configuration file for the ambient server.  To edit a configuration file, a user must open the configuration file and edit its contents manually.  Additionally, the ambient server needs to be restarted every time changes are made to a configuration file in order for the changes to take effect. </p>

<p>One of the goals of the project is to simplify the editing of the configuration file for running the ambient server.  With the user interface, we hope to eliminate the editing of a configuration file manually.  We hope to display the configuration file through the user interface and have the user edit the file through the interface.  Additionally, we hope that it will automate the restart process of the ambient server.  This means that the user does not even have to touch the ambient server file as everything should and can be done from the user interface. </p>

<p>CapabilitiesThis project was started in the first week of April, 2008.  It was originally implemented with stripes and the Tomcat server, however due to some implications, we opted to go with Wicket and Jetty.  Although it does appear to be much cleaner and easier to work with, we are still currently learning about the Wicket framework as we design the interface. </p>

<p>Currently the system can take in a HackyStat user name and password and have a user edit an already existing configuration file.  It allows a user to save a configuration file, which also restarts the Ambient Server for changes to take effect.  The user interface can display current Trigger/Action Pairs and the user may add and edit Trigger/Action Pairs if desired. </p>

<p>Below are snapshots of the current user interface, which is still heavily in development.  The first snapshot is of the page for editing actions, while the second snapshot is of the login page. </p>

 title : The btfm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>with tarballs of a bunch of modules, I want to loop round all the tarballs, extracting them, running Makefile.PL, ignore missing dependencies (as we&#39;re going to get to them), run make install and skip all tests.  </p>

<p>this tool automates those steps. </p>

<p>btfm is based on krang(krang.sf.net) - actually a stripped-down version of krang&#39;s build tools. </p>

<p>How does it worksimple, btfm extrats the module and builds it(support Module::Build or MakeMaker).  </p>

<p>Quick startget the source and assume you have the source under /tmp/btfm cd /tmp/btfm and run perl bin/module_build. this will install module Expect, IO::Tty and Module::Build from ./src into ./lib directory. These 3 modules are required to build other modules. download a cpan module and save it into ./src directory. note the module name should be of xxx-yyy-0.0.tar.gz format which is cpan convention by default. run perl bin/module_build --module xxx-yyy from /tmp/btfm. this will install the module xxx-yyy into ./lib directory. all built modules are in ./lib/ directory and you can copy them to wherever you want. </p>

<p>There are two common perl module install problems tackled in btfm: </p>

<p>answering module installation question.  module installation order. </p>

<p>They are handled by a perl syntax configuration file ./YuSis/Config.pm.  </p>

<p>hash ref $Expect_QA is where you can specify the module install question and answer.  </p>

<p>array @FIRST_PERL_MODULES specify module installation order. </p>

<p>I have used it a lot on Debian 4.0 and some on solaris. Based on my experience, most of the modules will install fine even if the dependent module is not installed yet as long as the installation doesn&#39;t die. As long as the dependent installed in the end, the module still work fine. some modules that i have installed using this tool are DBIx::Class, Class::DBI, DBI, DBD::mysql; Email::Send. Those are the kind of module that has bunch of dependencies.  </p>

<p>Commandsto build every modules under ./src directory: </p>

<p>perl bin/module_build </p>

<p>to build a specific module(s): </p>

<p>perl bin/module_build --module xxx-yyy  </p>

<p>you can also install more than one modules: </p>

<p>perl bin/module_build --module xxx-yyy --module aaa-bbb </p>

<p>to build all modules under ./src directory except few modules: </p>

<p>perl bin/module_build --skip-module xxx-yyy</p>

 title : The bzreader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main purpose of BzReader is to allow the offline browsing of the Wikipedia. </p>

<p>UsageThe typical usage would be: </p>

<p>Download one or several .xml.bz2 dumps of Wikipedia topics from http://download.wikipedia.org/backup-index.html You will need the files named pages-articles.xml.bz2 for your language. Alternatively, you may use any database dumps which follow Wikipedia XML format - Wikibooks, Wikitravel etc. 
<br/>Install BzReader Open the Wikipedia dump in BzReader (you can have multiple dumps opened at the same time, all of them will be searched together) Let BzReader create the index for fast retrieval of topics. This might be quite lengthy for big dumps. It takes about 4 hours on Core 2 Duo to index the current dump of all English topics (enwiki-20080312-pages-articles.xml.bz2, 3.5 Gb file). The BzReader index for this dump takes about 550 Mb. Browse! Enter your search terms into the search window on the left, wait for the result(s) and click on the topic. Try also something like &quot;music*&quot; to find anything that starts with &quot;music&quot;. 
<br/>Screenshot </p>

<p>New in v1.0.12Fixed a minor issue when trying to search for the empty string Known issuesChinese/Japanese/Korean users - please note that indexing the dumps in your languages is currently too slow to be of real use. This is due to the complexity of the actual languages. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really know the appropriate languages to actually fix the tokenizing code.

 title : The cant2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CAnt2 is a build tool targetting C/C++ source code projects, though it is also intended to be useful for more general build tasks. </p>

<p>It is currently in a very early state, with the initial set of source code being put together in a Win32 environment. </p>

<p>CAnt2 is intended to be Ant like, in that an XML file is used to define the build process. However C/C++ is not Java, and so it is expected that there will be some differences. The XML schema will grow around the needs of the project more as they are discovered, and may or may not mirror features of Ant. </p>

<p>These are the current goals, though some are long term. </p>

<p>Multiplatform. CAnt2 should be usable on Windows and Linux. The same build script should be usable on any platform. Efficient builds. Builds should be limited by the speed of the compiler/linker/related tools. Where possible, source files should be batched for the compiler. Fast incremental builds. A simple change to one file should take less than two seconds to compile and link. (Assuming that code is written to compile/link quickly) Customizable. Arbitrary programs need to be run by the users, and most needs should be satisfied without needing to touch the cant2 sources. Correctness. The build process should do the minimum amount of work, and do it right. Scalable on multi-core/multi-processor machines.  Scalable to many projects. All source code should be able to use one common build system, so one can just invoke the tool once to build everything. These goals are inspired by other build tools such as make, Jam/MR (and variants) as well as of course Ant. CAnt2 is also inspired by a blog entry made by Noel Llopis (http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0506/000092.html). </p>

<p>CAnt2 has the &quot;2&quot; as there is already a cant project hosted by code.google.com, but it is inactive and apparently dead. Initially this author thought to fork the cant source code, but the code in the repository has obvious license issues.</p>
 title : The code-base Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Conventional IDE bases tools does not scale as the volume of code in the project increases. IDE based build-solution is one such example. Another example is type navigation and searching. Brute force solutions like ‘grep’ fail to give reasonable response as the code size increases.  </p>

<p>Code-Base is tool that will help solve the above issue. This tool can parse managed assemblies, and stores the information in structured database. Once this is done, operations like type navigation and analysis becomes database operations – as such is much more scalable. </p>

<p>Code-Base is source-code persisted as a database. This tool can be run on the build machine as one of the final steps in the build process. The database could be a central DB, accessible to the whole team. Yet another approach would be to use in-memory DB like SQL Compact Edition and re-distribute the DB to all team members.  Once code is represented in a structured manner in the Database, we can think of different use-cases like analyzing code complexity, static analysis etc.</p>

 summary : <p>SummaryI&#39;m proud to present you the first release of DragMoveDrop project in collaboration with Pleyo </p>

<p>This is the first included drag and drop for GWT. It is also the first simple and optimized Drag and Drop. Tested on every Operating system, on every browsers, and build with a small computer (1Ghz and 512Mo Ram). His unique system of detecting allows you to increase performance when you are moving a widget.  </p>

<p>That is not all, i&#39;m preparing many examples of use ; as 2000 Widgets in a page, and keep a very fluid move on yours Widget, create and drag you own list, and many others behaviors (block Widget into a panel, copy a Widget on Drag, etc...) </p>

<p>To install DragMoveDrop, please look at gwt : http://code.google.com/p/dragmovedrop/w/list </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Supported Drag &amp;&amp; Drop Widgets (directly) :Label. Image. Focus Panel. (Every others Widget are indirectly droppable or draggable. Everything is explain on the Getting started guide). </p>

<p>4 new methods per Widget :</p>

<p>addDragListener(DragListener);   addDropListener(DropListener);   removeDragListener(DragListener);   removeDropListener(DropListener);  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The methods handle 11 listeners :</p>

<p>DragListener  DropListener   onDragStart(Widget sender, int x, in y)  onDropEnter(Widget sender, Widget source)   onDragMouseMoved(Widget sender, int x, in y)  onDropOver(Widget sender, Widget source)   onDragEnd(Widget sender, int x, int y)  onDropExit(Widget sender, Widget source)   onDragEnter(Widget sender, Widget target)  onDrop(Widget sender, Widget source)   onDragOver(Widget sender, Widget target)   onDragExit(Widget sender, Widget target)   onDragDropEnd(Widget sender, Widget target)  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Control your DragThe Drag Move Drop Project include the possibility to entirely control your drag : </p>

<p>Stop a move, Sets a Draggable Widget, which move on the click of an other, Sets Your detection padding, Control the fire of the listeners, Control the Drop Map, and disable some target, Update the position of the drop target when you want to. ... </p>

 summary : <p>Krash (Crash) is a build tool which produces self contained Javascript applications in a jar file for use with the Rhino Javascript engine. The current version of Krash is 0.1 (29 August 2008)  </p>

<p>Photo courtesy of BigFoto.com </p>

<p>What&#39;s in the box?Krash (Crash) is a small project to help make creating compact, robust, multi-platform JavaScript applications practicable using the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript engine. </p>

<p>Since Rhino is written in Java, Crash makes use of this to help build JavaScript applications using standard Java tools. It also provides a small set of Java classes, and a simple JavaScript library specifically designed to leverage both Rhino and Java, but within the JavaScript environment. </p>

<p>Using Crash, your JavaScript application can be distributed in just two files; the standard Rhino jar file, and a specially constructed jar file containing all the code and other artefacts of your application. </p>

<p>With the help of Crash, launching your JavaScript application can be as easy as typing: </p>

<p>  java -jar crash.jar  </p>

<p>What&#39;s under the hood?Krash (Crash) uses Java, Mozilla Rhino and the Apache Ant build tool to produce most of its magic. The rest is supplied by JavaScript itself. </p>

<p>You will need Java and Mozilla Rhino for your JavaScript application development anyway, only Apache Ant is an additional tool requirement. </p>

<p>Want to know more?Why not take a look at the manual? </p>

 summary : <p>Managarm is a modern operating system that is based on a virtual machine. Its objective is to provide a fast and stable operating system for daily use. Managarms device drivers are written in a managed programming language and are verified before executed. Modern virtual machine and just-in-time compilation techniques are used to achieve high performance without risking a loss of stability and security. </p>

<p>At the moment Managarm is in the very early stages of development and only few programs are supported. It is available for the Intel x86 (Pentium or better) architecture, however, it could be easily ported to other platforms. </p>

<p>Managarm is primarily written in the Korona programming language that was specifically designed for managed operating system and driver code. Some parts of the runtime library are written in assembly language; some utilities and applications are written in Java. </p>

<p>Currently Managarm&#39;s virtual machine only runs its own bytecode format, later also Java bytecode will be supported. It would be possible to implement a frontend for .NET but that is not planned to be realized in the near future.</p>

 title : The merevaik Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an ended proof-of-concept project. If you are finding a non-maven build tool try http://gradle.org or http://easyant.abrm.info/trac . </p>

<p>Our goal is to create a build tool with the functionality of the Maven and with the simplicity of Ant.  </p>

<p>Merevaik is an extension to the Ant which attains the convention over configuration principle over the three levels of ANT:  </p>

<p>properties,  tasks,  and targets.  You shouldn&#39;t define same targets and properties in your every project with Merevaik, just define once, and upload the repository, and dependency management will use it automatically. Merevaik uses Ivy as the dependency management. </p>

<p>Benefits of Merevaik: </p>

<p>Simple learning curve: You shouldn&#39;t learn a new tehcnology.  You may use plain old ANT tools Simple installation You sholdn&#39;t modify your existing build environment, only drop two jar files to ANT_HOME/LIB Lightweight tool The core of the Merevaik not bigger then 15-20 classes Easy IDE integraton The most of the IDE supports ANT based projects so supports Merevaik based projects too. You needn&#39;t specail plugins to handle Merevaik projects. Works in offline mode You can use components of Merevaik as traditional ANT task. (If you wouldn&#39;t like to use Merevaik). Our goal is maintain the documentation on high level. </p>

<p>You can download the entire collection of their specifications at http://www.mismo.org/files/mismo/MISMOSpring2007Release.zip </p>

<p>What is &quot;mismo-bindings&quot; project?There are several DTDs and W3C Schemas published by MISMO. This projects aims to ... </p>

<p>create Java classes that model those XML structures create Java/XML bindings to convert XML documents to Java Beans and Java Beans to XML documents create other utilities that developers working with MISMO (and perhaps other XML documents) will find useful at a later stage, do the same for .NET </p>

<p>In other words, mismo-bindings is a toolkit you&#39;d use to develop applications that work with MISMO XML documents. </p>

<p>FeaturesMapping of Java Beans to XML elements and attributes and back. This means you can unmarshal an XML document into a graph of Java Bean instances (not DOM tree) and also marshal the Java Bean instance graph back into XML. More natural naming of Java Bean classes and their properties. If you use automated code generation tools, it will not be as natural, because ours is done by hand (we do start out with generated code, but we then refactor it extensively by hand). More expressive relationship between nodes in the graph. By that we mean that if an attributes &quot;points to&quot; another element in the document (using IDREF or IDREFS), we provide not only properties that provide the values of the IDs, but also the actual bean instance representing the element that is being pointed to. In other words, if an &quot;ASSET&quot; element has a &quot;BorrowerID&quot; attribute with value &quot;ssn111111111&quot;, the &quot;borrowerID&quot; property will give the String value &quot;ssn111111111&quot;, but there will be another property named &quot;borrower&quot; on the same class that is a reference to the actual Borrower instance &quot;ssn111111111&quot; points to. More type-safe properties. In DOM, everything looks like a String. We create our mappings such that not just Strings, but Dates, Booleans, ints/Integers, BigDecimals and doubles/Doubles are represented when appropriate. As we said, we want to make it very easy to create applications that deal with MISMO XML documents. </p>

<p>DocumentationPlease take a look at our ReleaseNotes for information about what this version of our MyIsern system contains.  You can use our InstallationGuide if you would like to simply install and run the system.  If you would like to continue development on this project, our DeveloperGuide will help you get started.  Our code documentation may also be helpful for external developers to this project. </p>

<p>DescriptionISERN is a community of software engineering researchers who collaborate together on various projects.  MyIsern is a system created to help keep track of the researchers, organizatons, and collaborations within ISERN.  In the system, researchers belong to organizations.  MyIsern uses the organizations to keep track of the collaborations going on between researchers.  An example would be if reseachers at the University of Hawaii and Mississippi State University were working together, they would have a collaboration called UH-MSU to represent their work. </p>

<p>MyIsern allows users to create, edit, and delete information about the researchers, organizations, and collaborations that make up ISERN.  The system also produces a report of any records that may contain errors, such as a researcher who does not belong to an organization.  Users may also view a graph which represents the network by displaying organizations as nodes and collaborations as the edges between nodes. </p>

 title : The obibuild Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutObi has been superseded by the excellent sbt. </p>

<p>Obi is a build tool for Scala and Java projects. Obi uses a flexible DSL style syntax to specify a build configuration.  </p>

<p>Consider the following examples of a Java compilation task: </p>

<p>// Compile Foo and Bar in src/main/java into build/main-classes.
<br/>javac(srcdir(&quot;src/main/java&quot;)).
<br/>        destdir(&quot;build/main-classes&quot;).
<br/>        srcfiles(List(&quot;Foo.java&quot;, &quot;Bar.java&quot;))</p>

<p>// Create a compile task for all files in src/main/java.
<br/>val jc = Dir(&quot;src/main/java&quot;) &lt;&lt; javac</p>

<p>// Execute the task
<br/>!jcObi encourages builds that are simple, sufficient and efficient. Obi exposes tasks that exploit Scala&#39;s type system to reduce the amount of mistakes you make with a build. For example invalid files will not compile and tasks that do not have their preconditions fulfilled (e.g. a Javac task without a source dir) will not run. As Obi&#39;s tasks are immutable (side effect free) you can combine them in flexible ways to implement common features in other build tools. </p>

 summary : <p>A collection of Ant tasks that makes the project development cycle easier. The tasks reduces the burden for the programmer when creating build files. </p>

<p>The collection currently consists of the following tasks. </p>

<p>Apache Ivy tasks: </p>

<p>IvySubantTask which is a subset of Ant&#39;s subant task merged with Ivy&#39;s info task. Major differences compared to Ant&#39;s subant task are: </p>

<p>Input should only be a list of ivy files. A generic ant build must be set, the build file is executed in the directory of the ivy file. The ivy file is loaded (and properties set in the build) before the target is executed. Properties which are simmilar to Ant&#39;s subant tasks: buildpath, target, genericantfile, failonerror, inheritall, inheritrefs </p>

<p>The following nested elements are also support (see Ant&#39;s Subant task for documentation): property, propertyset  </p>

<p>InstallExample usage
<br/>   </p>

<p>First the ivy:buildlist task is used to get a ordered list of ivy files. The directory which they are located in are used as basedir when invoking module-build.xml. </p>

<p>IvyManifestCreates a property containing the transitive dependency for a given module. Useful when creating a jar manifest and dependencies needs to be specified. </p>

<p>Other tasks: </p>

<p>greatly solidify the code-base and depart from the maven-style command line include full and extensive documentation transform the jboss demonstration project into a quickfix based trading application introduce beanshell to make every part of the project as clean as possible This will take months to complete. If you believe in pure java builds and you have a real contribution to make then please email me at ashpublic@mac.com </p>

<p>Ashley Williams June 2009 </p>

<p>Introducing ProtoJ The Pure Java Build APIProtoJ is a pure java build, installation and deployment library that hands control over to you. There&#39;s no third-party ProtoJ application directory to maintain, no environment variables to set up and absolutely no other required software. Simply add the ProtoJ library to your project and get ready to experience the joy of a friction-free development cycle. So why not give ProtoJ a try right now, it really is as easy as 1-2-3: </p>

<p> Download the ProtoJ executable jar file.  Create a new &quot;basic&quot; project by executing java -jar protoj-exe-jdk5-1.9.2.jar -sample basic.  Try a few commands from the basic/bin directory: ./basic.sh compile archive hello-basic. When you&#39;re feeling more adventurous take a look at the jboss demonstration that demonstrates how ProtoJ can be used to build, store persistent configurations and launch a jboss project with considerable ease. You may be amazed at how easy this is to accomplish: not because ProtoJ is rocket science, but because it is based on java rather than xml. </p>

<p>Features to Enhance Any ProjectProtoJ abandons build scripts. It&#39;s &quot;unique selling point&quot; is that all use-cases are accessible in-code through the api, with just one call to Java in just one starter script! If you ever wished you could get rid of your build scripts then look no further: ProtoJ is targeted at you!!! </p>

<p>ProtoJ is part of your project. You don&#39;t have to hide away use-cases related to the build inside some xml file, to be handled by some other tool merely at the start of your project life-cycle. Compilation and jar creation for example belong to your project just as much as your core business use-cases and are accessible at build-time through to run-time.    </p>

<p>   ProtoJ plays nicely with maven. ProtoJ uses a traditional lib directory and support for filling it up from a maven repository is provided right out of the box. And going in the other direction, you can easily deploy your project artifacts to a maven repository so that they can be shared with other ivy or maven projects. Or indeed with other ProtoJ projects! </p>

<p>ProtoJ plays nicely with aspectj. Aspectj compiler support can be enabled with just a single method call, as can support for load-time-weaving. Then just drop your .aj files alongside your .java files and they will be picked up by the ajc compiler without any additional aspectj installation. </p>

<p>ProtoJ is available on all major platforms. Each release of ProtoJ is subjected to rigorous testing on Linux (Ubuntu), Unix (Mac OS X) and Windows (XP) and also on Java 5 and Java 6. If you work with any other platform then you can easily check for compatibility by following the instructions in the BuildingFromSource page.</p>

 summary : <p>RTEMS is a real time operating system developed for high performance embedded applications. RTEMS is implemented in C, though it was originally developed in Ada, so it supports application development in Ada and C as well as C++. It supports a variety of architecture for deployment including specialized embedded CPUs to x86. Development is normally done on a standard desktop or workstation using a cross compiler. </p>

<p>Since RTEMS is normally used in embedded applications the users normally develop their software on a different OS and machine then that which will be running the application. The tool chain that is used to build for RTEMS is based on the standard GNU compiling tools with various patches that are specific to RTEMS. Setting up the development environment from scratch is a complex task and very time consuming. Supplying pre-built tools for development aids users in adopting RTEMS for application development and keeping their development environment up to date with the current releases of RTEMS.   Currently there exist pre-built tools for RPM based Linux distributions and Windows (via MinGW). Given the rise of usage of Debian based Linux systems in recent years developing Debian packages for RTEMS would help expand the user base and service it better. The objective of this project would be to develop a set of Debian packages of the current RTEMS tool chain for a few of the most common Debian based Linux distributions, specifically Debian and Ubuntu. In addition to setting up packages for the current version of RTEMS, scripts will be built to help automate the packaging and testing future releases of RTEMS. The automation tools will be used to produce a liveCD that will have an entire RTEMS development environment on it that will allow users to test RTEMS before committing to it. With an install feature the liveCD would also allow for rapid deployment/upgrading of RTEMS development systems.</p>

<p>You can also kill a process by pressing Win+F4 and then clicking the window with your mouse. You can press escape or the right mouse button to exit this mode without killing a program. </p>

<p>SuperF4 should be able to kill all kinds of processes, whether they are hung or not. Beware though, killing a program does not give it a chance to save unsaved work. If you accidentally kill explorer.exe, you can start it again by opening Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc). </p>

 title : The tabimswitch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Other Languages: 简体中文 日本語 </p>

<p>TabIMSwitch is an FireFox extension which enables FireFox to save the Input Method of each Tab and change it accordingly when switching tabs. It also enables disabling Input Method for address bar. </p>

<p>For most east-Asian user such as Chinese/Korean/Japanese, people always have to use Input Methods for typing characters. But FireFox 2.0 has poor support for intelligent Input Method switching. For example, people may open several tabs, one for writing blog in Chinese, one for writing wiki in English, and the other for chatting (via Google Talk online) with Japanese friends in Japanese. When switching between these tabs, people may expect the Input method can switch intelligently. But FireFox 2.0 does not support that. </p>

<p>To enable this feature for FireFox, this extension is developed. The feature of the extension includes: </p>

<p>Save the input method status of each tab and switch the input method according to current tab. Switch to English input method when focus on address bar. Switch the input method status when changing between different windows. </p>

<p>Version 1.0 supports Windows 2000/XP/2003 with FireFox 2.0.0.*, FireFox 3.0, and new FireFox 3.1 beta. If anyone is interested in porting it to Linux platform, please contact me. </p>

<p>Now, view the tutorial and begin to setup it! </p>

<p>Thank all users of the extension, this extension has been reviewed and nominated as public addons. Access the page on Mozilla Addons Page</p>

 title : The traffometer-rsi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The emergence of GPS-enabled phones with internet access, highly variable traffic conditions, and the high cost of fixed road condition sensing equipment (such as traffic cams and in-road sensors)  has led a number of companies in recent years to the same conclusion:  why not utilize the presence of cell phones in people&#39;s cars to obtain data about traffic conditions?  As a simple example, if a cell phone transmits its location at various times during a driver&#39;s commute to work in the morning, this data provides a real-time report of traffic speed along the corridor taken by that commuter at that moment in time.  Companies that are working on technology to exploit this potential data include Inrix , Dash Navigation , and IntelliOne . The approaches vary between vendors, but there are some basic similarities:  the software is proprietary, the services are not extendable, and  the costs of the service will be significant.</p>

<p>The goal of the TraffoMeter Project is to create an open source community of developers and users around open protocols and applications for the transmission, analysis, and presentation of traffic data.  The potential advantages of the open source TraffoMeter Project over current venture-capital driven approaches include:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Lower cost. Both client and server software will be freely available.  Individuals, organizations, and communities can establish TraffoMeter servers and populate them with data. In contrast, none of the commercial vendors indicate that their servers will be freely available.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Improved privacy.  There are significant privacy concerns associated with the commercial offerings.  These concerns can be addressed more easily in TraffoMeter. For example, the code used to capture and analyze the data is available for inspection, private servers can be established for people who desire to control access to their data completely, and privacy protections can be introduced and improved as needed and desired.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Improved extensibility.  There are many kinds of data that can be applied to the problem of traffic analysis, many ways that data can be made available to a server for analysis, many ways that data can be delivered back to users, and many ways in which the data can be presented once delivered.  A goal of the TraffoMeter Project is to evolve an extensible infrastructure for traffic data collection, transmission, analysis, and presentation, enabling developers and users to &#39;scratch their own itch&#39; more easily and cheaply than would be possible with proprietary solutions.</p>
 title : The virtualagc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Virtual AGC and AGSThe purpose of this project is to provide an emulation of the on-board Apollo guidance computers, along with some ancillary items needed to make the emulation do something interesting. &quot;AGC&quot; stands for Apollo Guidance Computer.  The AGC was the principal on-board computer for NASA&#39;s Apollo missions, including all of the lunar landings.  Both the Command Module (CM) and the Lunar Module (LM) had AGCs, so two AGCs were used on most of the Apollo missions, but with differing software.   The computer and its software were developed at MIT&#39;s Instrumentation Laboratory, also known as Draper Labs. </p>

<p>&quot;AGS&quot; stands for Abort Guidance System, of which the computer portion was the Abort Electronics Assembly (AEA).  The AEA was a completely separate computer system from the AGC, with a different architecture, different instruction-set, and different runtime software.  It was in the LM as a kind of backup for the AGC, but was only supposed to be used (as the name implies) in case of an aborted landing. </p>

<p>Special thanks go to Ron Burkey for starting this magnificent project and for bringing the wonders of the Apollo era with regards to computing back to life. The purpose of this project is to continue the project by adding new capabilities like GDB/MI functions to allow debugging in gdb capable IDE&#39;s.</p>

 title : The want2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WAnt is a Pascal-friendly build automation tool. It automates the process of building, testing, and packaging applications and libraries much like Apache (ex Jakarta) Ant does. WAnt is kind of like Ant, without being Java-dependent, whereas Ant was &quot;kind of like Make, but without Make&#39;s wrinkles.&quot;  </p>

<p>WAnt is written in CodeGear Delphi (formerly Borland Delphi), primarily — but not exclusively — for users of Delphi and other Pascals. It was originally written by Juancarlo Añez in 2001. Juanca eventually ceded control of the project to Andrew J. Wozniewicz in 2005.  </p>

<p>WAnt features a GUI IDE called WIDE, in addition to the traditional command-line version of WANT.  </p>

<p>Both WIDE and WANT can run scripts written in WANTScript, a new, general-purpose, block-structured scripting language based on Modula-7 and designed to be programmer-friendly (i.e. readable, in the tradition of Pascal-like languages).  </p>

<p>WAnt is FREE software. It is released under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 and its distribution includes the complete Delphi 7/Object Pascal source code.</p>

 title : The winfoldersjava Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This small interface library for Java will allow your Java program to access the Win32 API call SHGetSpecialFolderPath without using Swing (see below for the Swing method). This call gives you the locations of system folders such as &#39;My documents&#39;, &#39;Application data&#39; and others. Comprises of a tiny Jar and a DLL file. Just include these in your project and you&#39;re ready. </p>

<p>How to use: </p>

<p>import com.catnapgames.winfolders.WinFoldersJava;</p>

<p>public static void main( String[] args ) {
<br/>	// The DLL needs to be loaded dynamically.
<br/>        // Adapt to your way of finding the file; here we assume it is in the current directory.
<br/>        // Load different DLLs according to whether the platform is 32 bit or 64 bit.
<br/>        String platform = System.getProperty(&quot;sun.arch.data.model&quot;).contains(&quot;64&quot;) ? &quot;_x64&quot; : &quot;&quot;;
<br/>        System.load( new File( &quot;&quot; ).getAbsolutePath() + &quot;\\WinFoldersJava&quot; + platform + &quot;-1.1.dll&quot; );
<br/>	System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_PERSONAL\t\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_PERSONAL ) );
<br/>	System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_APPDATA\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_APPDATA ) );
<br/>        System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA ) );
<br/>	System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_MYPICTURES\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_MYPICTURES ) );
<br/>	System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA ) );
<br/>	System.out.println( &quot;CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\t&quot; + getSpecialFolderPath( CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS ) );
<br/>}You may ask &#39;why not just get the java user.home property and append Desktop or My documents to that?&#39;. Well, that may work in the English version of Windows, but in other languages, Windows names the folders differently. Also, Vista has a different folder structure compared to WinXP. Calling the aforementioned API function is necessary to get the correct folder location. </p>

<p>Also, if you need only the &quot;My documents&quot; path and don&#39;t mind touching Swing you may not need WinFoldersJava. You can use javax.swing.filechooser.FileSystemView.getFileSystemView().getDefaultDirectory() instead.</p>
 title : The xml-protocol-testing-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Metis is an application that tests conformance of client and service implementation with XML/HTTP protocols. Metis functionality is exposed to the user as a Web GUI desktop application. </p>

<p>Metis leverages several third-party components (some of them mentioned below). To ease distribution and execution, the Metis code tree includes binaries (.JAR files) of its software dependencies. For example: Metis&#39; Web GUI leverages Jetty, an open source servlet container; while Metis&#39; persistent storage leverages HSQLDB, a relational database management system written in Java. </p>

<p>This site describes how to build Metis from source code and how to run/stop Metis using Apache Ant. Ant is a Java based build tool. More information on using Ant is available at http://ant.apache.org/manual/. </p>

<p>You’ll find an Ant build file at the root directory of the tools branch of the project source code tree. Ant build files are XML files, usually named build.xml. </p>

<p>The Ant build file describes itself. First, several global properties are created to specify several build or run/stop parameters. These parameters specify the location of the source code, build (or classes), and libraries (lib) directories. Other properties specify the name of the JAR file that contains the client  communication module (i.e. the classes required by client applications to  Communicate with the data server) and some JVM execution parameters. </p>

<p>You should be able to use the included Ant build file without further  modifications. If you do modify the parameters therein, make sure to adjust the  project’s structure accordingly. </p>

 title : The zoetools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Each library is built separately so you only need to build what you need for your application. </p>

<p>Dependency management is done through the use of symlinks.  If you are working on a filesystem or OS that does not support symlinks (such as Windows), I suggest that you download the packaged version in which all symlinks are dereferenced. </p>

<p>AutoNant is expected to be in the same directory as ZoeTools.  If you have AutoNant elsewhere, you will need to update the symlink pointers.  If in doubt, simply download the packaged version, which includes AutoNant. </p>

<p>I do not have a Windows machine on which to test using Microsoft .Net.  Some libraries make use of Mono libraries so at the minimum, you would need to include those libraries with your application.  Easiest thing to do, I think, would be to use Mono instead of .Net.  If you try this with MS .Net, please send me the results. </p>

<p>If you do not intend to rebuild the source, you don&#39;t need a full install of Boo.  You do, however, need Boo.Lang.dll </p>

 title : The 6300-project3-team3 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Information retrieval is a traditional application for computers, which has become even more prominent with the advent of the World Wide Web. The process of retrieving content from a text corpus (collection of text files) is normally managed by analyzing the text files to produce an index, and then having a separate query engine that uses the index to retrieve the desired text from the corpus. There is an inherent design tradeoff between the amount of analysis, as represented by the size of the index produced, and the performance of the engine, as represented by its response time when used to retrieve the desired text. For this project you will build an analysis tool, called AIM  (Analysis and Indexing Module), to support information retrieval.</p>
 title : The activitygraph Open Source Project on Open Hub

It&#39;s general enough that it could be used to analyze any type of temporal, categorical data. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it should allow you to compare the output of heuristics with some &quot;true&quot; output, to identify how accurate the heuristics are, as well as identifying where errors are occurring. </p>

 title : The c-program-slicing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>We want to create  open source tools which will achieve the slcing of c programs(maybe support more languages in the future). Our approaches are based on PDG&amp;SDG(program dependency graph &amp; system dependency graph).It is much alike the commercial products &quot;CodeSurfer of GrammaTech Company&quot;,however at current time, it is at the stage of designing. Our basic thoughts are as follows: 1.The c front end: </p>

<p>i.the c preprocessor which will maintain the accurate source information 
<br/>ii.the c parser which will output the abstract syntax tree,luckily, we have the GCC now which dumps the abstract syntax tree alrealy which greatly facilitates the construction of AST in memory. 
<br/>iii.based on the AST(abstract syntax tree),we want to construct the CFG(control flow graph) which is annotated with the def sets and ref sets(basic concept in programming slicing).And we will have a dump represention for the CFG 
<br/>iv.based on the AST, we want to construct the call graph of the programs ,which will be used in the construction of SDG.Also, like the CFG, we will dump it out in the file. 
<br/>2. The SDG Builder i.PDG builder.In this step, we will do the analysis of data and control dependency.Based on the above information, we build the PDG for each function 
<br/>ii.SDG builder.Based on call graph, we link each PDG, generating the SDG. </p>

<p>Difficulties: 1.pointer analysis 2.compound types:struct, union, arrays 3.function call:library call. Without the knowledges of information,we have to do more specific analysis</p>

 title : The cuts Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AbstractWeblogs (blogs) are becoming prominent forms of information exchange in the Internet. A large number and variety of blogs, like personaljournals or commentaries, are available for generalconsumption. However, effective indexes and navigation structures (like the table of content in a book) are not available for blogs. Therefore, it is generally not possible to navigate among entries in a given collection of blog entries in an informed manner. We focus on the segmentation of entries in filter-type blogs, with the aim of using this information for developing hypertext and navigational helps.  In particular, we are interested in the analysis of topic development patterns that can provide information about not only the entries themselves, but how these entries develop and relate to each other. The proposed algorithm, CUTS, maps entries into a curve in a way that makes apparent a variety of topic development patterns. We then use curve analysis for automatic segmentation of topics.  The resulting base topic segments are classified into different topic development patterns that can be visualized and indexed.</p>

 title : The falkon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Falkon aims to enable the rapid and efficient execution of many tasks on large compute clusters. Falkon integrates (1) multi-level scheduling to separate resource acquisition from task dispatch, and (2) a streamlined dispatcher. Falkon’s integration of multi-level scheduling and streamlined dispatchers delivers performance not provided by any other system. Microbenchmarks show that Falkon throughput (ranging from 100s to 1000s of tasks/sec) and scalability (to 54K executors and 2M queued tasks) are several orders of magnitude better than other systems used in production Grids.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, we have extended Falkon to include data management functionality.  Scientific and data-intensive applications often require exploratory analysis on large datasets, which is often carried out on large scale distributed resources where data locality is crucial to achieve high system throughput and performance. We propose a “data diffusion” approach that acquires resources for data analysis dynamically, schedules computations as close to data as possible, and replicates data in response to workloads. As demand increases, more resources are acquired and “cached” to allow faster response to subsequent requests; resources are released when demand drops. This approach can provide the benefits of dedicated hardware without the associated high costs, depending on the application workloads and the performance characteristics of the underlying infrastructure.  This data diffusion concept is reminiscent of cooperative Web-caching and peer-to-peer storage systems. Other data-aware scheduling approaches assume static or dedicated resources, which can be expensive and inefficient if load varies significantly. The challenges to our approach are that we need to co-allocate storage resources with computation resources in order to enable the efficient analysis of possibly terabytes of data without prior knowledge of the characteristics of application workloads.   </p>

<p>To explore the proposed data diffusion, we have extended Falkon to allow the compute resources to cache data to local disks, and perform task dispatch via a data-aware scheduler. The integration of Falkon and the Swift parallel programming system provides us with access to a large number of applications from astronomy, astro-physics, medicine, and other domains, with varying datasets, workloads, and analysis codes.  Large-scale astronomy and medical applications executed under Falkon by the Swift parallel programming system achieve up to 90% reduction in end-to-end run time, relative to versions that execute tasks via separate scheduler submissions.  Furthermore, data diffusion can further decrease application execution times by several factors and improve overall application scalability. </p>

<p>Falkon Goals </p>

<p>Reducing task dispatch time by using a streamlined dispatcher that eliminates support for features such as multiple queues, priorities, accounting, etc. Using an adaptive provisioner to acquire and/or release resources as application demand varies. Improve application performance and scalability through data diffusion and data-aware scheduling to leverage the co-located computational and storage resources offloading the shared file systems I/O with local disk I/O.  </p>

 title : The fin-ally Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Fin-allyProject OverviewFin-ally (Financial Ally) is a financial analysis and expense tracking tool written in Python using a wxWidgets GUI framework and a SQLite database layer. This tool is intended to address and answer a number of simple financial questions, such as: </p>

<p>What do I spend my money on? What types of expenses should I target for reduction to increase savings? What percentage of my weekly/monthly/annual pay am I saving? Additionally, Fin-ally is designed to provide a certain amount of graphical and numerical feedback about your expenses. This feedback will eventually be provided in three forms: </p>

<p>A list of expenses in simple grid format. Graphical expense tracking over time (ie: bar graphs). Basic numerical analysis. Project ComponentsAs described above, Fin-ally is designed to interpret and dislay financial data. In order to achieve this, Fin-ally needs to be able to collect financial information, turn them into persistent records, and display them to a human user. The major technical components are: </p>

<p>Data CollectionCurrently, data collection is handled via either a finance entry control or an import control. The finance entry control allows the user to input data for a single transaction, while the import control allows the user to load a financial data file similar to a Quicken file format. </p>

<p>SQLite databaseRecord persistence is handled via a SQLite interface, responsible for reading, writing, seraching, and maintaining a SQLite database (.db) file. </p>

<p>GUI InterfaceThe User Interface portion of Fin-ally is written using the wxPython framework, and handles the majority of the interaction between the database and the user. WxPython becomes the run-time &quot;master&quot; for Fin-ally, and it handles all program flow. </p>

<p>Project PrerequisitesIn order to run the Fin-ally application, the following software packages are required: </p>

<p>Python 2.5.1 or higher (when available). Beginning with verion 2.5.1, most Python distributions contain the sqlite3 module, which is required for Fin-ally. To get a Python distribution, check out the Python.org downloads. wxPython module for Python 2.5. This provides the required GUI modules and is typically not part of a standard Python installation. It can be found with the wxPython binary downloads. (optional) The Sqlite3 executable. This will allow you to open SQLite version 3 files and inspect them independent of Fin-ally. Extremely useful for debugging. It can be found with the SQLite downloads. Running Fin-allyExecuting the Fin-ally program can be done from a command line environment using: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; python FINally.py </p>

<p>and it can also be executed by double-clicking on the FINally.py file. </p>

<p>NOTE: If no database (.db) file is present in the root Fin-ally directory, the Fin-ally tool will prompt the user to input a file name (ending in .db), which it will then populate with sample data and use as the default database.</p>

 title : The gpstracktime Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TrackTimeTrackTime is a budget data logging solution for people running road courses. Assuming someone already has a laptop that they can securely mount in their car while doing laps they only need to get a consumer grade GPS receiver. </p>

<p>Data LoggerThe data logger runs continuously while you are the track and automatically begins recording your session when you get up to speed. It will stop recording when you are done, so there is no hitting a button everytime you go out or wondering if it&#39;s working. </p>

<p>Lap AnalysisThe lap analysis breaks up the GPS record into individual laps and shows you the line around the track. You can also replay various laps and compare your speed at different points along the track. </p>

<p>In order to account for GPS drift I currently have several ideas. First off, the only assumption that I make is that drift is negligible in the 2-3 minute time frame that it would take to make a single lap of the track. This means that all readings taken from a single lap are accurate relative to each other. </p>

<p>In order to create an accurate map of the track I set the GPS receiver on a fixed landmark right before and after creating the map. This allows me to sort of emulate a differential GPS setup(hopefully) and eliminate some of the drift that occurred during the map making(assuming that drift happens linearly over time). If I know the amount of drift then a simple translation will correct each data point depending on when it was taken. </p>

<p>In order to align laps captured on different days where the drift could be upwards of 50 meters(making direct comparisons impossible) I will take an iterative approach. Assuming they are all good laps where the car did not go off track, then all data points should be inside the track path created earlier. For every data point outside of the track, I will average together the distance needed to move the whole lap&#39;s data back onto the track. Given the length and complexity of the track itself, I think that this will likely produce good results. </p>

<p>Here is an example of the magnitude of the drift error in just one day over 3 sessions, all of the line in the pic should be right on top of each other  </p>

<p>After some more research, it turns out that the GPS drift/alignment problem might be a bit more difficult, here is an example of a recorded lap that aligns at part of the track and not another. Meaning there is some relative error that is coming from either drift or just inaccuracy in the GPS unit in that it can&#39;t keep up with the car while going around at ~100 MPH   Getting that data to line up correctly is currently the main problem I am facing. as a 20 meter error in one section of the track makes replaying the data not very useful. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>GPS DriftI also decided to get more information on effects of GPS Drift. I used the GPS Toolkit&#39;s rinexpvt to convert the freely available CORS data(in RINEX format) into positions to get the amount of GPS drift during a certain time period. This allows for some post processing differential correction of the GPS data I collected. </p>

<p>This is a graph of the 30 minute window that I was mapping the track during. My main worry is the amount of drift change within the 10 minute window that I was driving around the track. From this result the error should be less than half a meter over that amount of time, plenty small to produce good results.  </p>

 summary : <p>WAITERS ON WHEELS : COMPUTERIZED DELIVERY TRACKING SYSTEMWaiters on Wheels is a restaurant meal-delivery service started in 1997 by Sue and Tom Bickford. The Bickfords both worked for restaurants while in college and always dreamed of opening their own restaurant. But unfortunately, the initial investment was always out of reach. The Bickfords noticed that many restaurants offer take out food, and some restaurants, primarily pizzerias, offer home delivery service. Many people they met, however, seemed to want home delivery service but with a more complete food selection. </p>

<p>Waiter on Wheels was conceived as the best of both worlds for Sue and Tom – a restaurant service but without the high initial investment. The Bickfords contracted with a variety of well-known restaurants in town to accept orders from customers and to deliver the complete meals. After the restaurant prepares the meal to order, it charges Waiters on Wheels a wholesale price, and the customer pays retail plus a service charge and tip. Waiters on Wheels started modestly, with only two restaurants and one delivery driver working the dinner shift. Business rapidly expanded, and the Bickfords realized they needed a customer computer system to support their business operations. They hired your consultant firm to help them define what sort of a system they needed. </p>

<p>Sue described the current system as such “When a customer calls in wanting to order, I need to record it and get the information to the right restaurant. I need to know which driver to ask to pick up the order, so I need drivers to call in and tell me when they are free. Sometimes customers call back wanting to change their orders, so I need to get my hands on the original order and notify the restaurant to make the change.” </p>

<p>Tom continued, “The drivers get the copy of the bill directly from the restaurant when they pick up the meal, which should agree with our calculations. The drivers collect the amount plus a service charge. When drivers report in at closing, we add up the money they have and compare it to the records we have. After all drivers report in, we need to create a deposit slip for the bank for the day’s total receipts. At the end of each week, we calculate what we owe each restaurant at the agreed-to-wholesale price and send them a statement and check.” </p>

<p>Basic requirements : Design a system which does some processing when events such as these occur : </p>

<p>a customer places an order either via telephone or via the company website. a driver is finished with a delivery a driver reports for work </p>

<p>The system should also produce information at some specific points in time – for example, when it is : </p>

<p>time to produce an end-of-day deposit slip time to produce end-of-week restaurant payments time to produce weekly sales reports </p>

Identify the problems in the existing systems and propose a solution. Prepare a feasibility report. (Operational, Technical, Economical and Schedule) The schedule feasibility report should contain: Workload matrix Gantt chart and PERT Chart – to be done using an appropriate project management tool The operational feasibility should be discussed using PIECES framework Compare some appropriate / related methodologies and suggest a suitable one for developing the proposed system. Justify the selection. Identify the breakdown of work associated with the chosen methodology which would be undertaken. (Note: the tasks should be limited to the analysis and design stage, i.e. not including the development / coding and stages thereafter). Suggest with justification and apply appropriate techniques of determining user requirements. Summarize the findings. Demonstrate and apply TWO (2) paradigms of analysis and design specifically on Object Oriented and Structured approaches. Document each stage of the analysis and design to the appropriate standards. Present the solution.   </p>

<p>Individual Assignment (15%)
<br/>Each team member / individual should prepare a formal documentation of and present the 
<br/>physical design which was done by the individual – with the appropriate explanation / description of the design with regards to the finalized logical design a critical evaluation of the assignment in terms of problems encountered and how they were overcome, lessons learnt, etc. according to appropriate standards   </p>

<p>Individual Presentation (15%)
<br/>Each team member / individual should: 
<br/>Present his / her contribution of the solution for the Group Assignment Marks awarded here would depend on Project Knowledge / Professionalism and Contribution of the individual. 
<br/>  </p>

<p>4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
<br/>Contribution
<br/>Students are reminded that this is designed to be a group effort. It is not therefore sensible for every group member to be involved in every activity, though overall findings should be discussed and agreed by the group as a whole. Each individual is required to attach to his / her report a signed peer-to-peer evaluation form (to be provided by the module lecturer). This form allows the individual to assess his / her peers’ contribution to the project as well as illustrates the contribution of each team member. It should be remembered that people who do not contribute to the exercise cannot reasonably expect to get any marks from it. 
<br/>  </p>

<p>Minutes of meetings
<br/>Each group is to regularly submit the minutes of meetings to the module lecturer. The report should among other things contain details such as: 
<br/>date, start time, end time and venue of the meeting attendees / absentees – with or without apology reporting of previous meetings / outcomes / findings details of discussion based on agenda / conclusions drawn action list for group members Hardcopies of the minutes of meeting need to be attached as appendices in the documentation. Any difficulties / problems faced during the duration of the project – such as non cooperative members, etc. should be pointed out in the minutes.

 summary : <p>I&#39;ve been having some problems lately with some completely unmanagable log files (in one instance, I had a programs log file grow to fill the hard drive—~30GB—and had no way to stop it short of deleting the file). This project exists to try and mitigate the problems caused by programs with crappy logging mechanisms that can&#39;t be properly configured. There are three tasks I&#39;d like this program to accomplish: 1) automatically delete old log files, 2) automatically delete/prune log files over a certain critical mass (after about 1GB of information, even log analysis programs are pretty worthless), and 3) automatically role-over log files for programs that are no capable of doing this any other way. Well, its a wish-list (especially since I have no Java programming experience). Let&#39;s see how far this goes...</p>
 title : The jfonia Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jFonia is a framework/API for music, focusing on symbolical (discrete) data such as notes, clefs, measures etc. </p>

<p>It is a low level framework, aiming to facilitate the development of high level music software, such as score players, viewers, editors, analysis and composition tools etc. </p>

<p>The framework is still under development.  </p>

<p>GOALThe goal is to offer: </p>

<p>a special way to represent time-based information, using specialized iterators. Among other things, these iterators help bridge the gap between different music models, between score and performance (midi) etc. basic classes for common concepts such as pitch, rhythm, chord symbols etc. a basic set of algorithms which can be used to manipulate music (e.g. transpose, play, analyse, pitch spell,...). Algorithms operate on iterators, so as to decouple them from the actual music model used (similar to C++ STL) a basic model for common music, based on list representations. Advantages over a (trivial) tree-based model include the possibility of fragmentary information (e.g. only lyrics and chord symbols), decoupling of metric structure, algorithms that focus on specific aspects (e.g. rhythm or pitch) and others. support for graphical representation of scores, including graphical symbols, layouting, selection... a novel treatment of harmonic information (chord symbols) implementation of a set of conversions between existing music models such as MusicXML, Lilypond, MIDI, etc. an XML-schema for storing musical information DEVELOPMENTjFonia is mainly developed by Wijnand Schepens in Ghent, Belgium. </p>

<p>Part of jFonia is currently being used by http://wikifonia.org</p>
 summary : <p>Oops! 0.9.1 released on Nov 5, 2007!Oops!Oops! is a simple program to find missing dependencies.  You can specify a single class to search, a list of classes, or Oops! can even map the entire class path for any and all missing pieces.  Oops! will descend into every referenced class, recursively searching for references and verifying them against the specified class path. </p>

<p>AbstractIf you depend on 3rd-party code directly, your code will not compile unless you include it directly in your class path.  But you may run into problems when using a binary distribution of your 3rd-party utility, since its dependencies will not be immediately resolved in your development environment.  That is, if my project Foo depends on library Baz, that is sufficient for me to compile and distribute Foo with Baz.  The issue at hand is that if Baz requires Thud in a rare code path, Foo could blow up during use with a NoClassDefFound error.  I didn&#39;t include Thud with my release, and because my testing wasn&#39;t thorough, I didn&#39;t even know that it was needed!  Oops! is a tool to mitigate these issues.  It verifies that every referenced type is available in the class path, and can scan specific classes or the entire class path specification itself. </p>

<p>HistoryWhat does Oops! mean?  Unfortunately, it&#39;s all rather silly.  Originally, Oops! was to be called &#39;Depends.&#39;  This is not a very interesting name for a dependency checker.  Those using it started calling it &#39;Oops I crapped my pants&#39; instead, an homage from the Saturday Night Live spoof advertisement.  The name stuck, and here we are. </p>

<p>UsageAdd the oops.jar to your class path and execute the class oops.Main.  Even though it would be convenient to build an executable jar, using one unfortunately overrides the class path. There are three possible ways to use Oops!: </p>

<p>Find all unresolved dependencies for a given class. Find all unresolved dependencies for a list of classes. Find all unresolved dependencies for the entire class path. Typically, Oops! will only produce output when there is a problem.  Like many UNIX commands, no output should be celebrated, as it is the success condition.  However, if you enjoy watching your console scroll, you may specify -v or --verbose to make Oops! print its successes as well as its failures. </p>

<p>Find all unresolved dependencies for a given classSpecify this class as the argument for Oops! </p>

<p>java -cp %MY_CLASSPATH%;oops.jar oops.Analyzer some.class.file.to.VerifyFind all unresolved dependencies for a list of classesSpecify - as the argument for Oops! to read a list from standard input. Directly: </p>

<p>java -cp %MY_CLASSPATH%;oops.jar oops.Analyzer -
<br/>some.Clazz
<br/>another.package.Type
<br/>^ZOr via a list of classes: </p>

<p>java -cp %MY_CLASSPATH%;oops.jar oops.Analyzer - &lt; check_these_classes.txtThis mode is handy when verifying that a previous failure has been resolved. </p>

<p>Find all unresolved dependencies for the entire class pathSpecify no arguments at all to Oops! and it will map out the entire class path, making sure that there are no unspecified references. </p>

<p>java -cp %MY_CLASSPATH%;oops.jar oops.AnalyzerIntegrating with EclipseOops! isn&#39;t an Eclipse plug-in, but it still plays nice with this (and other) development environments.  When you run a Java class as an application in Eclipse, it inherits the project class path by default.  If you would like to easily verify your Eclipse project class path, add oops.jar to your libraries.  Expand it to find the Main type, and then right click this and Run As -&gt; Java Application.  Any output you see in the console will be unresolved dependencies.  Hopefully there are none! </p>

<p>Bonus UtilitiesOops! at this time comes with one bonus utility, Which. </p>

<p>WhichWhich is similar to the UNIX utility of the same name.  It finds the location of a loaded class and prints it to the screen.  You can list any number of class identifiers as arguments. </p>

<p>$ java -cp oops.jar oops.Which java.lang.String
<br/>java.lang.String: /usr/java/jre1.5.0_11/lib/rt.jarWhen the sole argument is a hyphen, Which reads the class list from standard input. </p>

<p>$ java -cp bin;lib\asm-3.0.jar oops.Which -

<p>Comments at the top of the corresponding code of each program explain what they do. Input files are mostly self-explanatory and are available at the &quot;input&quot; directory. </p>

<p>To use these programs, first extract them: </p>

<p>tar -xzvf mdanalysis.tar.gz </p>

<p>This will create a directory called &quot;mdanalysis&quot;, which contains input file examples in the &quot;input&quot; directory. Enter the &quot;mdanalysis&quot; directory and type </p>

<p>make </p>

<p>to compile the packages, if you have gfortran available. If not,  edit the Makefile to define the appropriate compiler. </p>

<p>If you have VMD installed, you can also use VMD-style selections by using the shell scripts (ex. energy.sh) scripts. These scripts read the input files which define the groups using VMD-style selections, writes the PDB with the groups definitions as a temporary file and run the appropriate program. </p>

<p>Of course this is not a great documentation. Please write to leandromartinez98@gmail.com if you want more information. </p>

 title : The mpihmmer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The MPI-HMMER project has moved to a newer, more permanent location.  Please visit http://www.mpihmmer.org for the latest news and access to the development source code. </p>

<p>The MPI-HMMER team is pleased to announce the impending release of MPI-HMMER.  MPI-HMMER is a multiple-level optimization of the original HMMER 2.3.2 code by Sean Eddy of the HHMI Janelia Farms facility. This optimization provides multiple layers of acceleration, from micro-vectorization of the p7Viterbi algorithm through parallelization using MPI. The hmmsearch and hmmpfam were refactored from PVM code into MPI code, and various hand optimization and code improvements were made.  The resulting code demonstrates good speedup and high parallelism on low latency connected systems with low OS jitter.  This new implementation is approximately 4x faster than the PVM version of HMMER, approximately 12x faster than the baseline single CPU tests. </p>

 title : The mzrock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionmzRock is a machine learning toolkit for automation of mass spectroscopy data analysis. The program was designed to work with chromatograms obtained from triple-quad instruments, but it could be easily adapted to work with other type of instruments.  </p>

<p>The main goal of the software is to mimic human calls in peak selection, grouping, and annotation of presence/absence of metabolite in a sample. From user point of view, all that needs to be done is to drop files into designated folder, and from this point on every step of the analysis is automated. The data is extracted into simple csv file formatmzCSV and software carries out the following steps: </p>

<p>detect peaks group peaks calculate various features used in classification use machine trained model to classify peaks and assign goodness probabilities match retention times to known metabolites write a report and various quality control spreadsheets  Installation    Before you start, you will need to install Perl and R. Perl is only necessary if you are planning to run monitorFolder.pl script, which will automatically convert mass spec files into mzCSV format and execute R scripts.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not found a way to convert Thermo .RAW files without Xcalibar installation, so if you are using Thermo QQQ instruments, you will need to run on Windows with Xcalibar installed.  There are rumors that Xcalibar can be run on Linux with Wine.  </p>

<p>Detailed Instructions for Windows UserStart R, and install &quot;randomForest&quot; and &quot;waveslim&quot; libararies. This can be done from command line with &quot;install.packages command. Or if you prefer using menu options in R GUI.  Download mzrock.release.zip file and unzip into C:\mzRock folder. This will create two subfolders. C:\mzRock\bin and C:\mzRock\DataSets  Edit configuration options in &quot;mzrock.pl&quot; file to specify location of R executable. Start monitorFolder command in the bin deirectory. This monitorFolder service waits for new files to appear in the DataSets folder, converts files to mzCSV and runs R scripts.  Training ModelsThe program comes with a default model for making calls on peak goodness. This model is by no means universal, and you will probably need to generate your own model for your instrument.  </p>

<p>First, start R, and change the work directory to a folder with mzCSV files.  </p>

<p>Training new model is very simple.  First load sample, ask user for input about quality of peaks, generate features that will be used in classification. The sequence of commands is shown below. The two most critical commands are getQuality() and validateSamples().  getQuality() computes features that will be used in training and validateSamples() will ask you to judge if peaks are good or bad. These calls are recorded and used in training the model.  </p>

<p>When you run validateSamples() command, you will be presented with a plot of a peak group and asked to type in one of the following responses. </p>

<p>&#39;g&#39; Peak is good  press &#39;b&#39; Peak is bad  &#39;G&#39; All peaks in group are good &#39;B&#39; All peaks in group bad bad &#39;i&#39; Ignore this peak &#39;I&#39; Ignore all peaks &#39;u&#39; Undo &#39;Q&#39; Stop traing The sequence of commands below also includes generation of confusion matrix which can be used to asses the quality of the model.  </p>

<p>#load R commands
<br/>source(&#39;../../bin/mzRock.beta.R&#39;)</p>

<p>#Load Samples
<br/>loadSamples();</p>

<p>#features that will be used in classification
<br/>Q = getQuality();</p>

<p># COMMANDS TO TRAIN A MODEL
<br/>#ask user for peak labels. Press &#39;g&#39; for good peaks, &#39;b&#39; for bad peaks, &#39;i&#39; to i
<br/>gnore, &#39;Q&#39; to stop
<br/>validateSamples()</p>

<p>#pull out subset of peaks that were validated
<br/>V = which(!is.na(mzrock$peaks$valid))
<br/>V= data.frame( peakid=V, valid=mzrock$peaks$valid[V]);
<br/>V = V[ V$valid == &quot;b&quot; | V$valid == &quot;g&quot;, ]  #keep only peaks marked as &#39;g&#39; or &#39;b&#39;</p>

<p>V$valid = factor(V$valid)</p>

<p>#create a training and testing subsets 
<br/>A=sample(1:nrow(V),nrow(V)*3/4);</p>

<p>#split 3/4 for training,  1/4 for testing
<br/>Train=V[A,]; Test=V[-A,];
<br/>#classifiation 
<br/>M=classifySamples(Q,Train,Test); </p>

<p>#confusion table
<br/>table(predict(M$model,Q[Test$peakid,]),Test$valid)</p>

<p>#save model to a file
<br/>save(M$model, &quot;mymodel.Rdata&quot;);
<br/>Running R code manuallyNormally, the code below will be executed automatically. But sometimes it is useful to run it within R manually for debugging purposes. Once again, your R work directory should be set to a folder with mzCSV files.  </p>

<p>#load R commands
<br/>source(&#39;../../bin/mzRock.beta.R&#39;)</p>

<p>#Load Samples
<br/>loadSamples();</p>

<p>#load existing model ( change here if you have your own model)
<br/>load(&#39;../../bin/DEFAULT.MODEL7.Rdata&#39;);</p>

<p>#write report
<br/>writeReport(model);</p>

<p>Matching Metabolite Retention TimesMatching of metabolite retention times is done in the last step of the report generation. The file containing retention times is called SRM2.csv. It is located in the top level of DataSets folder. In our lab, this folder and the SRM2 file are placed on a network shared drive writable by everyone in a group. Each user has a subfolder with DataSets subdirectory for their files, and we append new metabolites to the end of the SRM file whenever new metabolites are being monitored.  </p>

<p>The names of the fields in SRM2 are adapted from Thermo speak.  </p>

<p>polarity compound = name of the compoumd precursorIntensity = Parent m/z collisionEnergy   productMz = Fragment m/z expectedRt = Retention time in minutes   polarity,compound,category,precursorIntensity,collisionEnergy,productMz,expectedRt
<br/>-,2-oxobutanoate,Carboxylic Acids,101,11,57.2,21.8
<br/>-,acetoacetate,Carboxylic Acids,101.05,12,57.2,14.1
<br/>-,glycerate,Carbohydrate Precursors/ Derivatives,105,15,75,1
<br/>ReportsIf all goes well, mzRock will generate a report folder with number of spreadsheets and pdf files.  </p>

<p>qualityControl.csv file which contains most complete information with one peak per line output.  highestPeaks.csv file which contains table of groups vs samples. Here the rows are groups, samples are columns, and values in cells is AreaTop measure.  AreaTop is an average of top 3 intensities in the peak for a given sample. predictionReport.pdf file contains superimposed EICs from all samples   stackedPlots.pdf file which contains separated EICs for each group.  note about naming of groupsGroups are numbered based on quality, one being the highest. When matching the retention time, the group that has the highest quality within 2 minutes of expected retention time is renamed to group zero.</p>

 title : The piiu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The purpose of the utility is to provide users with a tool which can retrieve information from the web based on their personal preferences, browsing history and search pattern. To ascertain the user&#39;s browsing pattern the utility monitors the user&#39;s browsing activity over a period of time. When the user is on the move and needs some information, the user needs to send a SMS or E-Mail from his mobile device to the utility. The utility checks for new mails or messages on a regular basis and based on the content of the message received, the utility checks the user&#39;s browsing history to find what he had earlier browsed that matches the information he currently needs. It then extracts information from sites for which the wrappers are present and then compares the results from various sites. The utility then provides the best available information to the user by calling the user and reading the information over the phone. In addition the system also sends the result as an E-Mail to the user.</p>
 title : The plsnpairs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Partial Least Squares (PLS), was first introduced to the neuroimaging community in 1996 (McIntosh et al., 1996), for measuring distributed task responses (Mean-Centering PLS and Non-Rotated Task PLS). It has also been applied to measuring distributed patterns that impact on task performance (Regular Behav PLS, Non-Rotated Behav PLS and Multiblock PLS) and finally to both task-dependent and resting state regional connectivity (McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004). </p>

<p>The NPAIRS (Nonparametric, Prediction, Activation, Influence, Reproducibility, re-Sampling) package was first introduced with canonical variates analysis (i.e., linear discriminant analysis) and a reproducibilty metric (Strother et al., 1997) followed by the addition of prediction metrics (Strother et al., 2002). NPAIRS uses a penalized PCA basis (PCA denoising) adapted to optimize the reproducibility and prediction metrics for CVA. In addition to measuring distributed task and resting state responses NPAIRS provides a statistical resampling framework with basic building blocks for benchmarking and comparing preprocessing and data analysis, (i.e., processing pipeline) choices (Strother et al., 2004). </p>

<p> Both PLS and NPAIRS/CVA have proven to be robust methods for extracting distributed signal changes related to changing task demands in neuroimaging. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are currently being evaluated at the Rotman Research Institute.  </p>

<p>Note that the code is currently in beta development (version 1.0.7.8). </p>

<p>See what changes have been made in the latest version. Install and run  the latest version of plsnpairs (beta 1.0.7.8).   Alternatively, download the jar file  and run it from the command line using Java 1.6. New! Run plsnpairs via batch mode!  See User Guide Batch PLSNPAIRS for details.

<p>recognition of input file formats conversion of pdf to images conversion of input file images to target file images (defaults to png) connect to and use ocropus using python&#39;s subprocess concatenate multiple results (e.g. in case of pdf) to single file use cluster analysis to determine average and above average line break stripping of unnecessary html tags/format from output when concatenating convert html output to text if required </p>

<p>What features are planned for the future? </p>

<p>As the entirety of pyocrhelper was developed as a python class, it is conceivable that it could be included in any python script or (e.g.) pyQT4 application, such as in KDE. A KDE4 plasmoid would be quite cool as well, but I can&#39;t find any information on python for plasma. It&#39;ll probably be available when KDE4.1 comes out. </p>

<p>Apart from GUI interfaces, I want to build a proper conversion utility for html to OpenOffice/OpenDocument ODT format. There are some already available but I haven&#39;t been able to get any of them working...yet. </p>

<p>Another idea which might actually be useful is to build a utility to recursively scan an entire collection of (etc) PDFs to generate an index which can be stored in a database or searched etc. Once the class file is done properly and strengthened, it will be possible to develop around it. </p>

<p>As a final point, it is anticipated that as Ocropus develops, faster/better/more flexible utilities will grow out of it - this script should at least help to bridge the time until then.</p>

 title : The repk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>REPK (Restriction Endonuclease Picker) finds sets of 4 commercially available restriction endonucleases which together uniquely differentiate user-designated sequence groups from a user-supplied FASTA format sequence file. The user-defined sequences groups allow the user to determine particular groups (e.g. taxonomic) of sequences to be differentiated by the program. REPK is thus particularly useful in the case where a microbial community has been characterized by clone library analysis, as the actual sequences can be input into the program. If you have a database of known sequences from an environment, this program could be useful to pick some enzymes that uniquely discriminate the different groups in your database. </p>

 summary : <p>Remote system control via infrared head trackingSynopsisBy placing points of infrared light on either side of the users head and viewing it through an infrared camera it is possible to find the relative position of the users head. The Wii Remote is an inexpensive piece of hardware which contains, among other things, an infrared camera and an image processor which transforms sources of infrared light to point data on board the controller. The Wii Remote communicates with its home console using the Bluetooth HID protocol which means that by simply pairing a remote with the computer we can receive this infrared point data directly and process it further in MATLAB for the purpose of controlling remote hardware such as a camera mounted to a stepper motor. </p>

<p>ImplementationMany infrared goggles contain white LED&#39;s on either side of the wearers head. By simply replacing these with infrared LED&#39;s we can track the relative motion of the users head along the Tait-Bryan rotations (pitch, roll, and yaw). To receive point data from the Wii Remote a DLL has been written in C++ to act as a bridge between MATLAB and Brian Peek&#39;s WiimoteLib (http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/pages/wiimotelib.aspx). </p>

 title : The saveme Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The original goals of improving the support of Agilent microarray platform in Bioconductor, streamlining the microarray data analysis pipeline from statistical testing to experimental validation, and demonstrating the utility of pathway-focused annotation in the MAQC-II study may be implemented at a later date. Due to a change in priorities, I am now creating an embedded Entrez Gene database. We believe this change in focus will demonstrate a different methodology when practicing scientific discovery. </p>

<p>Entrez Gene database has a wonderful wealth of genetic information that is accessible via the internet. With the interactive search mechanisms in place at NCBI, you can learn such things as a gene’s proposed function, where it is located, and its relationship to other genes. As researchers, mining the information for specific goals can be a cumbersome task. Moreover, there is a need to integrate genomics information with the statistical applications written in R/Bioconductor. Being able to download a copy of the information from Entrez Gene on your specific computer allows easy accessibility and enables data mining. SQLite is a free database program written in C that is available over the web. With this tool, you can access the Entrez’ data we selected to be most useful. We have proven that this database, once constructed, can be easily embedded into other applications written in R, Java and Perl as well. R is a free software environment that allows statistical operations and Bioconductor packages to be run; Bioconductor is an open source project for the analysis of genomic data; being able to access the database via R can help researchers get at information they need without switching programs.  BioJava is a open source, bioinformatic organization, which focuses on using Java for the analysis of biological data. Java is highly availed by many bioinformatic researchers; by using an SQLite Java Wrapper/JDBC Driver, this data can be extracted, without switching to a C environment, though a C environment is required in the setup.  BioPerl is an organization that creates reusable, Perl programs for bioinformatics. Perl, likewise, is a great language for parsing specific information out of a database. Permitting the Entrez Gene database to be accessed in any of these languages allows for wider usability in data mining of this data. Our goal is to make examination of genomic data faster for the end user, available at no cost, and the database highly portable.</p>

 title : The spsc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A supercompiler is a program transformer that traces the possible generalized histories of computation by the source program, and builds an equivalent target program, whose structure is, in a sense, &quot;simpler&quot; than the structure of the source program. The simplification is achieved by removing certain &quot;redundant&quot; actions from the source program. </p>

<p>The goal of the project is to implement in Scala a positive supercompiler that is very close to the one described in papers by M.H.Sørensen, R.Glück, and N.D.Jones. </p>

<p>The current version of spsc can be run as a command-line application or accessed as a web-application. </p>

<p>spsc deals with programs written in a simple lazy first-order functional language (SLL). The intended operational semantics of the language is normal-order graph reduction to weak head normal form. </p>

<p>SPSC LiteSPSC Lite is a minimalistic version of SPSC, which may be useful for educational purposes and as a starting point for experimenting with supercompilation. </p>

 title : The testability-explorer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Quick LinksGetting Started | How Testability is determined | How to Contribute | Scores for Open-Source projects </p>

<p>Sample ReportsSource-annotated Report </p>

<p>Testability-explorer is a tool which analyzes Java bytecode and computes how difficult it will be to write unit tests for the code. It attempts to help you quantitatively determine how hard your code is to test, and where to focus to make it more testable. </p>

<p>Testability Explorer can be used: </p>

<p>As a learning tool which flags causes of hard to test code with detailed breakdown of reasons. To identify hard to test hair-balls in legacy code. As part of your code analysis-toolset. As a tool which can be added into continuous integration that can enforce testable code. </p>

<p>Currently the tool computes: </p>

<p>Non-Mockable Total Recursive Cyclomatic Complexity. Cyclomatic Complexity is a measure of how many different paths of execution are there in the code. It is computed, by counting the if, while, and case as branching primitives. It is recursive because cost of the method as well as any methods it calls are counted. It is total because cost of object construction as well as any static initializations are counted. And finally, it is non-mockable because any code which can be mocked out in test is not counted as part of the cost. This means that the score is based on the amount of complex code that cannot be mocked out in a unit test. Global Mutable State. Counts the number of fields which are globally reachable by the class under test and which are mutable. Mutable global state makes testing difficult as tests are not isolatable, the global state needs to be set up and cleared between tests. Law of Demeter. This is the principle that calling methods on objects you get from other collaborators is trouble, instead, the collaborator should call that method itself. It makes testing harder because your mocks must expose some internal state through these methods. </p>

 title : The winbase Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WinBase is intended to be used to establish a baseline or obtain a current snapshot of a Windows system.  In an operational environment it is often difficult to to have accurate configuration management data on a system that can be used for comparison after an intrusion.  Additionally, after an intrusion the current baseline of a system must be obtained in order to assist in the act of determining what has changed.  WinBase is a tool that will assist in obtaining this information. </p>

<p>WinBase is a VBScript that utilizes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries to interface and obtain data directly from from select Windows OS WMI classes.  The output from these queries is completely customizable and can be used to automatically produce custom reports.  Due to the granularity of the Methods under a particular class only relevant data is queried thus eliminating irrelevant data to sort through.  WinBase can be executed either locally or remotely under any authentication credentials required to obtain the information sought.  Because WMI and its classes are part of Microsoft Windows &quot;trusted platform computer system&quot; the level of reliability is high and the risk of comprise and/or the yielding of fraudulent data is greatly mitigated. </p>

 title : The agrajag Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Why bother?Agrajag&#39;s aim is to make a bit, but learn a lot ;) The objective is to create an arcade-like top-scroller 2D shooter game. </p>

<p>UtilitiesAgrajag is written in Python. It uses: </p>

<p>Pygame as its foundation Phil&#39;s pyGame Utilities (abbr. PGU) - a mostly GUI library lightweight Python XML DOM implementation (xml.dom.minidom) </p>

<p>Sometime/somehow it may use Psyco (but currently doesn&#39;t, as it&#39;s not available for x86-64, and that&#39;s what I /lavrin/ use). </p>

<p>DescriptionThe design (ughhh... if we can dignify it by using the word) of the game strives to allow for easy extension. Adding new enemies, bonuses, weapons, shields, etc. is a matter of creating the graphics and an XML description. At least it should be that easy... </p>

<p>Most artwork for the game comes from free internet sources. Some is created by the authors. </p>

<p>Agrajag features a level editor developed in PyQt4. Unfortunately, it&#39;s currently only a little more than a piece of crap. </p>

 title : The aimdojo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionA collection of AIM-related JavaScript modules that are designed to work with the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit. The modules include a wrapper for the Web AIM API and UI widgets that show a user&#39;s presence, buddy list and allow sending and receiving instant messages (IMs). </p>

<p>By using these modules, you can get a fully functioning AIM-based text IM client running in a web page.  </p>

<p>The modules are designed for Dojo 1.1 and above. </p>

<p>The modules are open source versions (new BSD license) of the modules used by AOL Webmail. Two other open source components are bundled and used with these modules: </p>

<p>SoundBridge.swf from the BSD-licensed JavaScript Sound Kit. The aim.date module includes some functions from the MIT-licensed Matt Kruse&#39;s Javascript Toolbox. </p>

<p>In addition to wrapping the Web AIM API, these modules use AOL&#39;s OpenAuth to handle user authentication. This means the modules do not handle a user&#39;s name and password. </p>

<p>Latest News and ExamplesThe first release, 1.0.0 is available in the Downloads area. For information on how to use the code, download  the 1.0.0 source, and open the index.html file. </p>

<p>The code is also usable from the AOL CDN, so you do not have to install all the code on your server. Examples that use the AOL CDN are here (same examples in the source downloads, but configured to use the AOL CDN): </p>

<p>Simple.html: Just shows the simplest usage of the modules, using aim.ImPanel with the default options.  ResizableFloatWithHoverCard.html: Shows how to use aim.ImPanel inside other dijit widgets that allow the buddy list to be dragged and resized.

 title : The btbt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an attempt to fill in the gap left out by BlogTorrent.</p>

<p>The idea is to have a simplified torrent tracker based on BlogTorrent without the &quot;EasyDownload&quot; and which exists now between nerds running trackers and normal users doing the download. And with many of the publicaly available trackers availablity not being guranteed and folks who co-host not_so_legal stuff, which being taken down all the time, there is a urgent need to have a software infrastructure which will allow any reasonably knowledgeable user to setup and serve his files via bittorrent from his shared server.</p>

<p>The Project attempts to achieve the following:</p>

<p>* Run a efficient non-binary tracker -  to be able to run on a shared server
<br/>* Ability to share from server, popularly called a server-side seeding – to prevent sharing from dying off due to lack of a full or complete seed.
<br/>* Simple to setup
<br/>* Be OS/Platform neutral – PHP and python for glue code</p>

<p>The software will be shipped with scaled down version of the official bittorrent client so as to benefit from upstream modifications.
<br/>It will also be shipped with a stripped down version of python to support the bittorrent client and to make sure we work most OS/platforms.</p>

<p>The Software has the ability to use a database or can run off a flat-file database.</p>

<p>Users will have the ability to do most tasks that need to be done with bittorrent
<br/>* creating torrents for files on the server - maketorrent.php
<br/>* seeding torrents - seeder.php
<br/>* stopping and starting torrents - start.php and stop.php
<br/>* modify torrent - updating tracker information - updatetorrent.php</p>

<p>All the above php files are mostly front-ends to equal programs available in the official bititorrent client.</p>

<p>Once the torrent is created and tracked. It can be downloaded via any available bittorrent client.</p>
 title : The casiousbmididriver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis project provides a simple Mac OS X driver for a USB MIDI interface found on Casio keyboards. </p>

<p>This is entirely based on the SampleUSBMIDIDriver provided by Apple with the CoreAudio SDK. </p>

<p>You can download it here: </p>

<p>Casio USB Midi Driver (Universal) </p>

<p>Please also visit the Compatibility Reports wiki page and add your keyboard if it&#39;s not already there. </p>

<p>Update: Snow LeopardA new version of the driver is available for Snow Leopard (10.6) users. This driver will not work with previous Mac OS X version. The installation procedure is the same. </p>

<p>InstallationTo install the driver, simply copy the CasioUSBMIDIDriver.plugin file into the Library/Audio/MIDI Drivers folder in your home folder or your system&#39;s harddrive. </p>

<p>You should then be able to plug your keyboard with a USB cable and power it up, it will show up in the Audio &amp; MIDI Setup utility as &quot;Casio USB MIDI Interface&quot;. </p>

<p>The driver should be compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and up, on PowerPC (G4 and up) and Intel processors. </p>

 title : The cnc-milling-machine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The CNC PCB Milling Machine project is the complete specifications for the software and hardware for a complete light duty Computer and Numerical Control (CNC) milling machine designed primarily to mill isolation traces in copper clad printed circuit board material.  Additionally, it can handle milling of soft materials such as plastics and aluminum. </p>

<p>This entire project is now open source.  This includes the design of the physical machine itself (most of which I owe to many other excellent sources), the design of the electronic motor driver circuit, the PIC assembly source code for the firmware embedded in the driver circuit, and the Java source code for the GUI based application that runs the machine. </p>

<p>I am very much a junk box designer.  The primary selection criteria from most of the hardware that makes up this project was what I already had on-hand or could obtain cheaply form local resources and EBay.  The design of the physical machine was limited by what I could do with a limited set of power woodworking tools (Table Saw, small Drill Press, Router and Router Table, and Power Miter saw).  There is practically nothing in the physical design of the machine itself that did not come from one of the many excellent references sources I found via a never-ending series of Google searches. </p>

<p>The software is my own design, influenced heavily by the ideas of many others that had done similar projects in the past.  It is not the best example of my Java development work, but I am proud of it just the same. </p>

<p>Currently, the software works only with my machine microcode.  It does not generate any G-Code output or convert between formats, but it certainly could go that direction.  There is a simulated machine mode that can work without a connection to the microcode.  It will do the displays and generate the isolation traces, etc.  Modifications to output G-Code (or any other protocol) would not be terribly hard to do, and could be fit into the project nicely.</p>

 title : The easyhook-continuing-detours Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Description </p>

<p>EasyHook starts where Microsoft Detours ends. This project supports extending (hooking) unmanaged code (APIs) with pure managed ones, from within a fully managed environment like C# using Windows 2000 SP4 and later, including Windows XP x64, Windows Vista x64 and Windows Server 2008 x64. Also 32- and 64-bit kernel mode hooking is supported as well as an unmanaged user-mode API which allows you to hook targets without requiring a NET Framework on the customers PC. An experimental stealth injection hides hooking from most of the current AV software. </p>

<p>The following is an incomplete list of features: </p>

<p>A so called &quot;Thread Deadlock Barrier&quot; will get rid of many core problems when hooking unknown APIs; this technology is unique to EasyHook You can write managed hook handlers for unmanaged APIs You can use all the convenience managed code provides, like NET Remoting, WPF and WCF for example A documented, pure unmanaged hooking API Support for 32- and 64-bit kernel mode hooking (also check out my PatchGuard 3 bypass driver which can be found in the release list) No resource or memory leaks are left in the target Source code was rewritten entirely and this will greatly improve performance, stability and maintainability Experimental stealth injection mechanism that won&#39;t raise attention of any current AV Software EasyHook32.dll and EasyHook64.dll are now pure unmanaged modules and can be used without any NET framework installed! All hooks are installed and automatically removed in a stable manner Support for Windows Vista SP1 x64 and Windows Server 2008 SP1 x64 by utilizing totally undocumented APIs, to still allow hooking into any terminal session. Managed/Unmanaged module stack trace added Get calling managed/unmanaged module inside a hook handler Create custom stack traces inside a hook handler You will be able to write injection libraries and host processes compiled for AnyCPU, which will allow you to inject your code into 32- and 64-Bit processes from 64- and 32-Bit processes by using the very same assembly in all cases. EasyHook supports RIP-relative addressing relocation for 64-Bit targets. License has changed to Lesser GPL (LGPL) No unpacking/installation necessary anymore. No CRT bindings for release configurations, reducing deployment size about some megabytes. The Visual Studio Redistributable is not required anymore. First feature complete release of EasyHook... The library is currently still in BETA state, but should be stable enough for development. Don&#39;t hesitate to report any bugs you find, because that&#39;s the only way for me to fix them. You can be sure that any serious bug you report, will be fixed soon... </p>

<p>Donations to support Intel Itanium </p>

<p>I want to add support for Itanium, so that EasyHook will span through all architectures, platforms and modes (managed/unmanaged/kernel). If anyone has used/new hardware, supporting Itanium, which he/she can donate, please contact me. Also money for buying such hardware would be appreciated! As I am currently a student, I can&#39;t effort this myself. Of course we could talk about some sponsorship agreements... </p>

<p>WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE LICENSE CHANGE? </p>

<p>To wrap it up (without warranty): </p>

<p>You are granted to sell any software that uses EasyHook over DLL, NET bindings or EasyHookQueryInterface(). This is covered by the native API and the managed interface. You are NOT granted to sell any software that includes parts of the EasyHook source code or any modification! If you want to modify EasyHook, you are forced to release your work under the LGPL or GPL... Of course this only applies to the library itself. For example you could release a modification of EasyHook under LGPL, while still being able to release software, which takes advantage of this modification over DLL or NET bindings, under a proprietary license! You shall include a visible hint in your software that EasyHook is used as module and also point out, that this module in particular is released under the terms of the LGPL and NOT under the terms of your software (assuming that your software has another license than LGPL or GPL). I decided to release EasyHook under LGPL to prevent commercial abuse of this free work. I didn&#39;t release it under GPL, because I also want to address commercial vendors which are more common under Windows. </p>

 title : The feedpope Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>feedpope is a server-side RSS aggregator that populates an Amazon SDB database with parsed feed entries, allowing use of a variety of front-ends.</p>
 summary : <p>This is a translation of the javascript side of Ely Greenfield&#39;s FABridge to C++. The idea is that you can write flex code in C++ instead of simply making externalinterface calls to communicate with the flex side. It uses a slightly modified version of Ely&#39;s FABridge.as on the actionscript side. </p>

<p>For more details, see: http://anirudhs.chaosnet.org/blog/2008.03.13.html  </p>

<p>Sample:  </p>

<p>oRootObj.Call(&quot;getpanel1&quot;).Call(&quot;settitle&quot;, &quot;Panel1&quot;);
<br/>pBridge-&gt;ClassRef(&quot;mx.controls.Alert&quot;).Call(&quot;show&quot;, &quot;SampleAlert&quot;);Currently, this is a windows only solution where the flash player ActiveX control is embedded onto a Visual C++ application. You can use externalinterface to talk to the flash player, but you&#39;d have to handle passing of the XML back and forth yourself. </p>

<p>The bridge can have N worker threads processing requests from flash and vice versa. This frees the main MFC thread from getting blocked while some heavy CPU intensive operation is happening. </p>

<p>Multiple flash player instances are supported by the bridge. </p>

<p>Actionscript exceptions are serialized and passed across the bridge and thrown as C++ exceptions. </p>

<p>It uses TinyXML to parse XML. </p>

<p>Hopefully with the help from the opensource community, the Flex C++ bridge will be available on the Linux and Mac in the future. For more info regarding this, see FutureDirections.</p>

 summary : <p>Freeway (CCFR) is under active development as a lightweight replacement for the clunky-feeling front ends for car computers that have been released.</p>

<p>Freeway runs as a front-end for Winamp. This means that all the actual audio and video file handling is done by Winamp, a rock-solid and well-trusted media player, although Winamp is never actually seen on-screen. Using Winamp as a sturdy backbone, Freeway supports many more audio and video file formats, including protected WMA files, and can take advantage of Winamp input and output plugins, as well as visualizations (AVS and Milkdrop).</p>

<p>Other features include GPS compatibility, movie listings, weather, driving directions, web browser, NES/SNES emulation support, Bluetooth support, and more.</p>

 title : The ild-fa07 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Indexing Large Databases project classThe class website: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/class/cis4930fa07ilg/Overview and Course DescriptionThis course will cover the topic of indexing for different type of large, (typically) disk-based data sets. Indexing generally refers to the design, implementation, and use of data structures that allow you to quickly find database objects that satisfy a particular selection criteria. For example, in a database containing a large number of surveillance photographs, you may want to find all photographs that are similar to the picture of a known criminal, without having to check each and every photograph in the database explicitly. In the class, we will study data structures that are appropriate for this problem, as well as for many other database search problems.  
<br/>Assignment 1:Basic Record/Schema/File Management </p>

<p>Due September 21, 2007 </p>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to implement the basic database record management code that will serve as a basis for the other assignments in the class.  All told, you will be asked to implement six different C++ classes in this assignment, as well as a menu-based, main program that makes use of them. When you are done, you will have a program that is able to store database records with an arbitrary schema on disk in binary format, retrieve them as needed, and apply basic selection predicates to files of binary records (an example of the sort of selection query that your code will be able to answer is &quot;Find all records corresponding to women over the age of 35&quot;.) 
<br/>The key reason that I am asking you to implement these six C++ classes is that they will fully encapsulate the steps that are need to store structured data records on disk in binary format, where the records possibly have many different data attributes, and each attribute has its own name and type. By carefully designing and implementing this set of classes, it will be possible to encapsulate and then then subsequently &quot;forget&quot; about all of the problems and difficulties associated with storing structured data records in binary format, then loading them into memory once again at a later time and correctly interpret the bits and bytes. Since all database indexing tasks revolve around being able to get data off of disk and make sense of it, and this is exactly what the six classes will allow you to do, it is probably not surprising that we will use these classes as the basis for all of the subsequent programming that you will do in this class.

 title : The jangle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WhatJangle (Just another generic library environment) is an experiment with middleware for library applications. If you build, use, manage or just want simple access to a library system, Jangle could be for you. </p>

<p>WhyThe aim of the Jangle project is to provide a free, easy to use framework for building web services for LMSs/ILSs by exposing resources through the Atom Publishing Protocol. </p>

<p>The goal of Jangle is to develop conventions intercommunication between the backend library services, such as ILSes and other applications and the AtomPub server (known as the Jangle &quot;core&quot;). </p>

<p>By leveraging AtomPub, it eliminates the need to develop an entirely new API and allows developers to use existing client library and knowledge to easily integrate library data into new places. </p>

<p>WhoSeveral Jangle developers work for Talis, a major provider of library systems. More information about Talis&#39; involvement. </p>

<p>However, Jangle is open source software, released under the GPL v2: see Licensing for more information. It is free for anyone to use, modify and redistribute under the terms of that licence. </p>

<p>The project hopes to engage with: </p>

<p>Developers of open source ILS software who want to develop consistent, standardised APIs for their software Developers who would like to add REST services to an ILS they have been provided by a vendor Companies interested in adding REST services to their products DocumentationUsing JangleInstalling the provided reference implementations Jangle APIThe format for requests to Jangle and responses back. </p>

 title : The jcrasher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UsageThe most convenient way to use JCrasher is by running an Ant script like jcrasher.xml: </p>

<p>ant -f jcrasher.xml </p>

<p>It performs all steps completely automatically. </p>

<p>ExampleThe Ant script performs the following steps. You can follow along with the example files included in the examples directory. Download the examples directory, open a command line in your copy of the examples directory, and run our Ant script: </p>

<p>ant -f jcrasher.xml </p>

<p>jcrasher.xml compiles the Java source files under test. It looks for a file like testees.txt and interprets every line as the location of a Java source file under test, relative to the src property in jcrasher.xml. Our testees are trivia/DivByZero.java, trivia/ManyParameters.java, and trivia/NullDeref.java located in the src directory. jcrasher.xml runs JCrasher on the compiled Java classes under test. JCrasher will generate JUnit test case (as Java source files) for the classes under test. Now we should have the JUnit test cases DivByZeroTest1, DivByZeroTest2, DivByZeroTest3, ManyParametersTest1, etc. Additionally, JCrasher has generated a test suite that aggregates all generated test cases in JUnitAll. (All these files are included in the result zip file generated in step 5.) jcrasher.xml compiles the generated Java source files (the JUnit test cases). jcrasher.xml runs JCrasher&#39;s extended version of JUnit on the generated test cases. This will enhance the JUnit text output by suppressing redundant warnings. jcrasher.xml packages the results into a zip file like examples-jcrasher-2.1.3-2007-03-17-2206.zip. This zip file includes the original testee sources, the generated JUnit test case sources, the log output of JCrasher and JUnit, and the configuration files used: jcrasher.xml and testees.txt. Optionally, you can clean up all generated files (except the zip file) with the following. </p>

<p>ant -f jcrasher.xml clean </p>

<p>RequirementsJCrasher should run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. </p>

<p>The most convenient way to use JCrasher is by running an Ant script like jcrasher.xml. You can download Ant for free. </p>

<p>JCrasher generates JUnit test cases. You can download JUnit for free. </p>

<p>Google Summer of Code 2007			       </p>

<p>Table of Contents </p>

<p>I.	Overview II.	Tool Information and Dependencies III. 	Running the Code IV.	Editing the Code V.	Future Work </p>

<p>I. Overview </p>

<p>This project is the result of two other projects that were canceled during the summer of 2007.  Initially, we had planned to write a  program to install the Fedora Directory Server, but after weeks of  work with little success, we realized that FDS may not be a viable option for Ubuntu. </p>

<p>After the FDS problems, we needed to change the direction of the project.  The minimum goal was automating the installation of a simple LDAP server.  So the first steps were figuring out how to install LDAP on Ubuntu.  After that we needed to find out what  pieces of information were needed for the LDAP installation. Around  this point we found out that work had resumed on the another Ubuntu  project that did all of this work already. The program was called  authtool, and it supported a number of different authentication  protocols.  Among them was an LDAP and Kerberos server.  After  seeing the code for the backend, it was clear that it would take us more than a month to improve upon the installation, but the frontend was not nearly as well established. </p>

<p>So, the final project was working on the authtool frontend for  LDAP and Kerberos, because the only information given was the title of each text entry box.  I added a regular expression syntax checks and information buttons that explained the purpose of each piece of information.  These features should make deploying a LDAP+Kerberos server significantly easier. </p>

<p>II.	Tool Information and Dependencies </p>

<p>I wrote the programs using the Emacs editor, designed the GUI with  the Python Glade-2 GUI builder, and used Python code to tie  everything together.  If you want to edit the code, install the  following Ubuntu Packages: </p>

<p>python 
<br/>glade-2 
<br/>emacs </p>

<p>III. 	Running the Code </p>

<p>Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you can enter  the appropriate directory and run the code with the following  command:      </p>

<p>python LDAP_and_Kerberos.py </p>

<p>From here use the program as instructed, check the syntax of your entries by clicking the button labeled &quot;More Info&quot; next to the text entry box. </p>

<p>IV. 	Editing the Code </p>

<p>To edit the code use your favorite text editor to LDAP_and_Kerberos.py, and use glade-2 to edit LDAP_and_Kerberos.glade.  Be sure to build the GUI using glade-2&#39;s built-in &quot;Build&quot; function. </p>

<p>V. Future Work </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why I would like to continue this  work after the Google Summer of Code.  First of all, my project  changed three times, so I didn&#39;t get as much time to work on it as I would of liked.  Second, I see that I can help improve code for Ubuntu in my free time.  Third, Ubuntu doesn&#39;t have a great tool for easily installing authentication, and authtool would help Ubuntu take the next step into the server market if it worked well. </p>

<p>So, I would like to continue writing authtool front ends.  The next  step would be writing another tool for a NIS server.  It would build nicely on the work I have already done.</p>
 title : The llvm-qemu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is part of the Google Summer of Code 2007. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to modify the QEMU dynamic binary translator to use components of the LLVM compiler infrastructure to turn it into a highly optimizing dynamic binary translator in order to increase the performance of QEMU even further. </p>

<p>Instead of directly emitting code for the host architecture QEMU is running on, the target code is first translated to LLVM IR, then a selection of LLVM&#39;s optimization functions are applied to the IR and the LLVM JIT is used to generate code from the optimized IR for the host architecture. </p>

<p>Since the translation to LLVM IR, the optimization and the code generation comes at a cost of an increased execution time, it&#39;s not feasible to apply this process to any piece of code, else the execution time would be even lower. Especially since on average a program spends 90% of its time within 10% of the code it is critical to get these 10% to execute fast, for the other 90% of the code parts might only execute once or only a few times and the extra time spent to generate the optimized code would not pay off. Therefore the idea is to identify the &quot;hotspots&quot; of the program. The most simple way is to count how many times a piece of code has been executed and performing an optimizing translation once a certain threshold is hit or falling back to the current binary translation of QEMU if not. </p>

<p>Another approach could be to instrument the target code at LLVM IR level to get an execution profile (LLVM already contains support for profiling) and use it to identify hotspots and to be able to perform profile-guided optimizations during runtime. Possibly a combination of both approaches will lead to the biggest overall performance gain. Detailed speed measurements will be performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the different approaches, especially in comparison to the approach currently used by QEMU.</p>

 title : The ocaml-burg Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OCamlburg is a code generator generator that emits Objective Caml source code. Conceptually, OCamlburg is close to tools like OCamlYacc and OCamlLex: it reads a specification and emits code derived from this specification. Just as these tools, OCamlburg is most useful for compiler writers. While Lex and Yacc are typically used to generate compiler front ends, OCamlburg (and Burg-style code generators in general) are used to implement compiler back ends, that is, code emitters. </p>

<p>For documentation, see the OCamlBurg page in the Wiki. A manual page and examples are part of the source code.  </p>

<p>OCamlburg is originally part of the QuickC-- compiler project, where you can still find it. However, since it is a little burried there, I am making it available here on its own. The QuickC-- compiler is released into the public domain. Since this license is not available here, I have chosen the also very liberal BSD License.</p>

 summary : <p>Happy times!Version 0.3.9 of Spotify makes Scrobblify obsolete by adding scrobbling support! </p>

<p>I&#39;m removing the executable Scrobblify but leaving the project as it is. </p>

<p>Scrobble the songs you listen to with Spotify. </p>

<p>ScrobblifyScrobblify sends the tracks you play with Spotify to Audioscrobbler (Last.fm). It is still an experimental program. </p>

<p>At the moment, only Windows is supported (but it also works under Wine). </p>

<p>Use the Issues tab when reporting errors. You want to check out the Frequently Asked Questions page first. </p>

<p>ImportantYou need the Last.fm client, and untick the option which makes it send status messages to MSN Messenger (Spotify does that anyway) under Tools &gt; Options &gt; Messenger. </p>

<p>Make sure that you are logged in to Last.fm in the client. </p>

<p>Latest versionMultiple Spotify accounts supported Falls back on a five minute track length if no meta-data is found New icon Allows only one running instance Other solutionsTwo scrobbling-solutions for OS X can be found here: Scrobble for Spotify discussions on Last.fm: Spotify scrobbler for Mac OS X (quick link to the second: spotify-scrobbler project page). </p>

<p>A more general approach to Spotify plug-ins (for the Windows client), with an implementation of a scrobbler, can be found on the spotify-plugins project page. </p>

<p>Building the source codeTo build, you need to link against Audioscrobbler. </p>

<p>Scrobblify is in no way affiliated with Spotify or Last.fm</p>

 title : The tweego Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>General informationTweego is an AS3 tweening engine based on the Go ActionScript Animation Platform. It’s one of the first parsers for Go. The syntax is similar to the glorious Fuse. It’s perfect for complex tweens with multiple sequences. </p>

<p>At the moment special properties and a documentation is missing. </p>

<p>Current version0.5 </p>

<p>Syntax examplesThere are various ways to use Tweego, e.g. </p>

<p>var t:Tweego = new Tweego;
<br/>t.push({target: target, x: 100, y: 200, time: 1, ease: Bounce.easeOut});
<br/>t.push({delay: 2});
<br/>t.push({target: target, width: 500, time: .5, ease: Elastic.easeOut, func: onComplete});
<br/>t.start();var t:Tweego = new Tweego;
<br/>t.target = target;
<br/>t.push([{x: 100, time: 1, ease: Bounce.easeOut}, {y: 100, time: 3, ease: Quad.easeOut}])
<br/>t.push({func: someCallback});
<br/>t.push({target: target2, scale: 3, time: .3});
<br/>t.start();Single sequences also can be created via: </p>

<p>Tweego.tween(target, {x: 500, y: 500});Some examples are included in the package. </p>

<p>FAQIs Tweego Fuse 3? </p>

<p>In a way yes. It&#39;s actually based on the Fuse syntax and you can use it in the same way. But some features are still missing. </p>

<p>Can I use the current version yet? </p>

<p>Of course you can. The API is ready and the core features have been implemented. Newer version will only have extensions and internal optimizations. </p>

<p>What classes I need to know? </p>

<p>You just need to use the main Tweego class (org.tweego.Tweego). If you want to work with events, you have to know the event classes, too. All other classes are used internally. </p>

<p>Has Tweego exactly all featurs of Fuse? </p>

<p>Well, at least it will have most of them. Beside the still missing things, on one hand some things are optimized and on the other hand we don&#39;t want to overload Tweego. But all important (and also some not so common) features are or will be implemented. If you are missing something, let us know. </p>

<p>What role plays Go? </p>

<p>To dumb it down: The Go ASAP by Moses Gunesch is the core engine, which handles the sequences. Tweego parses and prepares the data and finally applies it to your target object.  </p>

<p>How is the performance? </p>

<p>For Benchmark tests on the core platform please see: http://www.goasap.org/benchmarks.html Even if Tweego is not hardcore optimized, it&#39;s quite powerful. Of course the performance can not be exactly that good, because Tweego has a lot of functionality. But for example the performance is much better than the widespread Tweener&#39;s performance.</p>

<p>StatusI have stopped updating this project as of now, but I will leave it open for people to check out as an example of of using pyAMF, Django, Flex, and PureMVC. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently refactoring the whole thing into a much tighter structure on the server side, removing the core functionality into a reusable library that isn&#39;t dependent on the view. So far that is working out well and will facilitate the development of several applications in a suite of related tools. It will also be a nice base for other developers to build front ends for. </p>

<p>The plan is to release that core as open-source. The most likely scenario is that the core will get released and I will keep the interface layers I am working on proprietary for our business.</p>

 title : The wordsend Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The WordSend project consists of a set of software tools that convert Scripture file formats to and from USFM or USFX for the purpose of typesetting, publication, and archiving translations of the Holy Bible in many languages. This is a cross-platform, open source project based on Microsoft .NET and the Mono Project with GTK (depending on the platform). The primary development language is C#. The primary platforms targeted are: Microsoft Windows XP or Vista, Linux (with emphasis on Debian and Ubuntu), and Mac OS X. WordSend works with a word processor to do the &#39;heavy lifting&#39; of Scripture typesetting. The initial target is Microsoft Office Word 2003 or 2007, but we have plans to support Openoffice.org Writer (and anything else that supports Open Document Text). </p>

<p>If you want to be informed of updates to WordSend, you may join the mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/wordsend or http://lists.ebible.org/mailman/listinfo/wordsend for the (currently very infrequent) updates. </p>

 title : The wpbt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an attempt to fill in the gap which exists now between nerds running trackers and normal users doing the download. And with many of the publicaly available trackers being taken down for all sorts of reasons, there is a urgent need to have a software infrastructure which will allow any reasonable user to setup and serve his files via bittorrent from his shared server.</p>

<p>The Project attempts to achieve the following:</p>

<p>* Run a efficient non-binary tracker -  to be able to run on a shared server
<br/>* Ability to share from server, popularly called a server-side seeding – to prevent sharing from dying off due to lack of a full or complete seed.
<br/>* Simple to setup and ideally should be part of an existing publishing frame work, to reduce or remove any learning curve involved – hence the choice of intergration with WordPress
<br/>* Be OS/Platform neutral – PHP and python for glue code</p>

<p>The software will be shipped with scaled down version of the official bittorrent client so as to benefit from upstream modifications.
<br/>It will also be shipped with a stripped down version of python to support the bittorrent client and to make sure we work most OS/platforms.</p>

<p>The Software has the ability to share the database that is being used by wordpress or can run off a flat-file database.</p>

<p>Users will have the ability to do most tasks that need to be done with bittorrent
<br/>* creating torrents for files on the server - maketorrent.php
<br/>* seeding torrents - seeder.php
<br/>* stopping and starting torrents - start.php and stop.php
<br/>* modify torrent - updating tracker information - updatetorrent.php</p>

<p>All the above php files are mostly front-ends to equal programs available in the official bititorrent client.</p>

<p>Once the torrent is created and tracked. It can be downloaded via any available bittorrent client.</p>

<p>The whole interface will be integrated into wordpress as a plug-in so that the complexity is hidden from the users. The admin can setup the plugin with minimal knowledge of bittorrent and the users can use with no or very little knowledge of the infrastructure that allows them to do it.</p>

<p>Latest NewsAvailable here: Latest News </p>

<p>We added a Wiki page for news snippets so you can keep up on the latest developments easily by subscribing to the Wiki RSS feed. </p>

<p>User documentationThe Voodoo team has put great effort into preparing proper documentation for the end users. Please make sure to go through it as it answers several common questions. </p>

<p>Unfortunately currently the documentation is only available in English. We would appreciate if the community helps in translating it to other languages. We are looking for the following translations (in order of importance): Chinese, Korean, German and Russian, at the moment. </p>

<p>Developer documentationTwo white-papers detailing the technology that went into the kernel are being prepared and will be available soon. One of them describes the changes made in the kernel from a higher abstraction level, to enable developers to get to grips with the source tree. The second one is a highly technical paper describing the design and implementation of the vastly improved SSE3 emulator. Further documents may be available in the future. </p>

<p>Bug reportsNote: We have exceeded the attachments quota for Issues on Google Code. We&#39;re going to ask Google to extend it, and/or find alternative methods for you to get your system info or KP screenshots to us. Until then, please use SendSpace or Mediafire for the .tar.gz files, Pastie for pasting crash logs and ImageShack for putting KP screenshots. </p>

<p>Please go through the list of open bugs and if your problem is in the list, STAR it instead of posting a new report. Starring a bug report means voting for it and will push us to try fixing that first, and also helps avoid duplicate reports. </p>

<p>We are not accepting any more bug reports for sleep/resume problems. Incomplete reports will NOT be entertained. Please be prepared to describe what steps you have taken to fix the problem yourself. Only report an issue if you believe its a bug in the kernel. We have found that almost all bug reports for the release candidate have been because of external reasons (like kexts, not updating to 10.5.5 and so on). Once ready, go to the Issues tab. </p>

<p> Other Kernel Features (slightly outdated info) </p>

<p>Supports sleep/resume as well as SpeedStep on most systems (use in conjunction with the SpeedStep kext) Massively improved SSE3 Emulation layer, up to 3 times faster and fully multithread-capable (thanks Turbo) Real-time clock fix for SSE2 users (no system slowdown/stutter when SpeedStep is on, supports less than 1 GHz cpu speeds) On-the-fly cpuid opcode patching for AMD support (boot retail on AMD!) Support for 64bit on AMD Black-listing of problematic kernel extensions More secure: Execute-Disable (XD/NX) is turned on by default for supported systems HPET enabled on supported systems, cleaner boot-up code Legacy VMware support by using busratio= bootflag. Source-code is open under APSL. (Not New BSD!) </p>

<p>Theme track info </p>

 summary : <p>This framework allows for a web site to be built without any xml configuration files.  </p>

<p>All of the configuration is done via the annotations in the web page itself. </p>

<p>The framework provides Inversion of Control functionality to allow a web page to be built by just having to write standard POJO&#39;s. All parameters to the action methods will be determined by the framework at startup.  </p>

<p>The framework interrogates the web site on startup, and generates a series of helper classes that represent the IOC control for the site. This removes the dependancy on using reflection at run time. </p>

<p>Please note that this framework is in alpha stage at the moment.  In general it works quite well, however there are no unit tests and little documentation at the moment.  </p>

<p>This will improve as time goes by. </p>

<p>At the moment there is only 1 person working on this project, but if anyone else is interested in helping out, please let me know. </p>

<p>Also, if you use the framwork and have any feature enhancements/requests. please let me know. </p>

 summary : <p>This project provides code that can be used in conjunction with other open source projects in order to merge HR job applicant attachments into a single PDF file. The following document formats are currently supported: </p>

<p>Microsoft Word (.doc) Rich Text Format (.rtf) Portable Document Format (.pdf) Open Office Writer (.odt) TIF image (.tif) JPG image (.jpg) This project would be used in conjunction with a Recruiting system (such as Oracle/PeopleSoft Human Capital Management).  Most Recruiting systems enable applicants to store attachments such as resumes, CV&#39;s, reference, transcripts and other miscellaneous documents.  One common complaint Human Resource users have of such systems is that it is difficult to review applicant applicants because they must open each attachment individually in order to review.  This project helps to streamline the process by providing a way to extract the various attachments, convert them to PDF format, and merge them into a single PDF document that a hiring team can review. </p>

 title : The arkinventory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Beta Versionsensure you make a backup copy of your saved variables file before installing a beta version - you cannot revert back to an older version without that backup. </p>

<p>your saved variable file is normally located in \World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\yourwowaccountname\SavedVariables\ArkInventory.lua </p>

<p>a simple way to back it up is to just do a copy and paste then rename the new file (using the version number of AI is a good idea), eg ArkInventory-3-01-09.lua </p>

<p>AboutArkInventory (AI or ARKINV) is an inventory mod that was based off EngInventory when the BtS 2.0.0 patch came out and I needed a working replacement. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>AI&#39;s display windows are built from &quot;virtual bars&quot;, you assign categories (either the default ones or ones you create via rules) to bars so that items in that category are displayed on the specific bars you want. There is no limit to the number of bars you can have inside a window but obviously you only have so much screen real estate before it becomes &quot;too many&quot;. </p>

<p>AI uses several methods to assign a default category to an item such as what professions you have, tooltip scanning, basic type/subtype and PeriodicTable. You then assign those categories to a virtual bar. </p>

<p>As the default categories are not perfect, nor will they be correct for the way some people play, you can over-ride them by creating a rule that matches either a single or multiple items. </p>

<p>KeybindingsAI will toggle via B (the default backpack open) or any other key you have assigned to open the backpack (so long as the Blizzard Bag/Bank frames are being hidden).  There are also keybinding choices to various other parts and functions from AI. </p>

<p>To access your Keybindings; </p>

<p>Press ESCAPE to bring up the blizzard menu. click on Key Bindings. scroll down to ArkInventory. bind the keys you want to use (or unbind if required).  Reporting BugsBefore reporting a bug please check the FAQ and the issues list to see if the bug you are about to report has already been reported (or dealt with). </p>

<p>After checking that your bug hasn&#39;t been reported you can create a new issue. </p>

<p>When entering an issue please make sure that you include the following; </p>

<p>the AI version number (not the svn revision number). AI won&#39;t have mid version releases, except betas, and those will have beta version numbers. the version of WoW. what language (if not english). a screenshot for visual bugs (if you can&#39;t explain it clearly). the error message(s) (if you have an error mod installed then the entire stack trace would be even better). Known Issuesreplacing a larger bag with a smaller bag can leave some items highlighted (if bag highlight is enabled) moving an item from one guild bank tab to another will leave a ghost item behind until you view that tab again (it also increases the tooltip count for that ghost item). honor token icon displays the faction for the logged on character, not the displayed character Version HistoryIf you really want to see what got changed in each revision there is a VersionHistory.txt file included that has all those details. </p>

<p>Title frame: consists of the main icon, clicking on which will bring up the main menu, then the current characters name is displayed (in green for online and red for offline), lastly followed by several smaller icons which allow you to toggle the other display windows (as well as the current one), the close icon is obvious - this frame can be hidden if not required Search frame: enter search text - this frame can be hidden if not required Container frame: where your bars and items are displayed Bag Changer frame: allows you to move, swap, add or remove a bag (it mirrors the same functionality that the Blizzard frame has) - note that while you have this frame displayed everything needs to be recalculated to cater for a lack of API functionality that can tell me when you&#39;ve moved a bag so it will be slightly slower with this opened.  when you move the mouse over one of the bags it will highlight all the slots in that bag (you can change the colour if you need to). this frame can be hidden if not required Status frame: is for showing how many empty slots you have remaining, if you only have normal bags you&#39;ll only have a single xx/yy (where xx is the number of empty slots and yy is the total number of slots), if you have profession, ammo or soulshard bags you will also see xx/yy variants for each type of bag, it also has the standard gold frame - this frame can be hidden if not required.  You can also format the emply slot status text via the config menus under Settings &gt; Empty Slots &gt; Display Format Keyring </p>

<p>It would appear we have 32 keyring slots even though the default Blizzard container only ever shows the smallest number of slots possible (rounded up to a factor of 4). Note that their may be internal code that restricts the number of keyring slots you can actually access but as the Blizzard API is currently telling AI that there are 32 slots that&#39;s what it displays. Bank (in offline mode) </p>

<p>The character name will be shown in red (instead of green) and the item icons are faded when you are viewing a bag, bank or keyring in offline mode. The item fading is an option that you can turn off if you want to see them at their normally displayed (alpha) level Guild Bank </p>

<p>SearchingLocally </p>

<p>ensure that the search frame is not hidden (config menu, settings page) </p>

<p>searching is done against an items name.  you can use LUA string patterns, see (link) </p>

<p>enter any text in the search field, as you enter a character any items that do not match are faded so that those that do are more obvious.  there is also a clear button on the right hand side that you can click on the clear the search text. (you can also just delete it manually) </p>

<p>Globallyrequires that the tooltip option to show item counts is enabled (otherwise all you get is a big list of items that you and all your alts have with no way of seeing whats where) </p>

<p>chat link and dressup clicks are functional </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Custom Categories </p>

<p>Custom categories are easy, fast, and efficient.  You create a custom categories via the configuration menu, and then just assign items to that custom category. </p>

<p>They do have one downside and that is that they are very basic, they only match against an items ID and soulbound status so where you have an unbound item with an, eg, &quot;of the Wolf&quot; or &quot;of the Owl&quot; sufix, or the same soulbound item but with different enchants/jewels applied then both items would be assigned to the same custom category. </p>

<p>If you need that level of differentiation then you will need to create a Rule to handle it. </p>

<p>RulesWhat are rules? Rules let you to categorise your items exactly the way you want to by allowing you to use various bits of item data to write a formula that will match that item (and others like it). </p>

<p>Once you have your rule created you simply assign it to the bar of your choice so that the items that match the rule will are displayed on that bar.  Allowable rule functions can be found here and some example rules can be found here </p>

<p>Rules are global, that is every profile can see every rule you create, they can be enabled or disabled per profile and are set to disabled by default when you create a new profile. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>BasicsRule: the number assigned to this rule. you cannot modify this value. rule numbers are assigned sequentially. </p>

<p>Enabled: tick this if you want the rule to be used. disabled rules are ignored. default value is ticked. </p>

<p>Order: rules are processed in ascending numerical order based on this value. default value is 0. if you find that another rule keeps picking up an item you want elsewhere then you would create another rule with a lower order to place it in the proper location. rules with the same order number are processed in a potentially random sequence (or at least one that cannot be known beforehand) so only reuse the same order number if the rules would not have any overlapping items. </p>

<p>Description: a description of the rule. </p>

<p>Formula: a formula that defines which items match a rule, defaults to false. </p>

<p> </p>

 title : The bluntarchitecture Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Blunt Architecture project is a lightweight web application framework showcasing ALT.NET best practices such as: </p>

<p>Domain driven design Test driven development Inversion of control / dependency injection Model, view, controller The Blunt Architecture project is based off of the S#arp Architecture project.  Where the Blunt Architecture project differs is that it is meant to be used as a learning tool rather than a ready-for-production framework.  Because of this, the Blunt Architecture project strives to avoid outside dependencies wherever possible.  This allows the user to focus his or her attention on the concepts presented without the added distraction of also having to figure out the syntax and details of third party tools.  Although this constraint causes certain tasks to be more tedious (e.g. object relational mapping, dependency injection, etc.), it should make the project more approachable to users unfamiliar with the third party libraries commonly used for simplifying the implementation of these concepts (e.g. NHibernate, StructureMap, etc.). </p>

<p>The overall goal of the Blunt Architecture project is to present ALT.NET best practices in the easiest manner possible while allowing the user the flexibility to plug in whatever third party libraries they wish once they are comfortable with the framework. </p>

<p>Documentation for this project can be found here </p>

<p>To start playing around with the framework, you can download the latest release here or checkout the latest version of the code through Subversion at http://bluntarchitecture.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</p>
 summary : <p>BSDRadiusBSDRadius is open source RADIUS server targeted for use in Voice over IP (VoIP) applications. While there are quite large number of Radius servers (including free) available in the world, little number of them (if any) are developed with !VoIP specific needs in mind. Typical !VoIP RADIUS server should be able to take high amount of AAA requests in short time periods, handle large databases, and respond timely to prevent time-outs and request retransmission cases. Most commonly used VoIP protocols (SIP and H.323) use small number of Authentication methods (e.g. CHAP and Digest), and this can allow reduce processing overhead and code size of server. </p>

<p>The server is released under the BSD license, which means that you are allowed to download, install, use and modify it at no charge. </p>

 title : The contactsnearby Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Contacts Nearby application allows users to discover geographic locations of other people in their extended social network. Social networks or “friend graphs” are getting increasingly popular on the internet and allow applications to become aware of trust relationship between users. Combine this information with the geographical location of each user and you get a valuable tool in possible emergency situations.  </p>

<p>Imagine being on site at an emergency situation. You could well have the best aid workers or medical staff within a hands reach. The Contacts Nearby application gives you the ability to discover you have contacts in common and allows you to ask referrals from mutual contacts. This can accelerate finding useful contacts in your area and building trust with them.  </p>

<p>Key requirements:Allow you to specify your location via web, SMS, email - using a latitude and longitude or an address  Allow you to specify your privacy preferences for who is allowed see your current position.  Use an existing &quot;friend graph&quot; you might be maintaining on social networking sites like Facebook or LinkedIn  Allow you to query which contacts are nearby via the web, email or SMS, using maps and text messages  See &quot;contacts of contacts&quot; who are in the area  Ask the &quot;mutual contact&quot; for a referral or &quot;hookup&quot; email or message  You should receive updates when a contact enters your neighborhood.  This project takes advantage of the following technologies:Facebook as a provider for social information.  Google Maps for visualization of geographical information.  Google Maps Geocoding Services to translate addresses into positions.  InSTEDD’s Twitter Bot technology which enables communication over SMS messages.  An ASP.NET web application to integrate the application with Facebook.  Facebook.NET - an open source library for developing Facebook application with .NET.  Current Status:Currently the Friends Nearby application is available in beta and integrates with facebook’s social network capabilities. However future development should enable integration with any social network tool that supports the Open Social specification as well as tighter integration with InSTEDD’s directory and Identity store.  </p>

 title : The cookcc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CookCC is a lexer and parser (LALR (1)) generator project, combined.  It is written in Java, but the target languages can vary. </p>

<p>CookCC comes with two unique features, which were the original motivations for this work. </p>

<p>CookCC uses a unique approach of storing and loading DFA tables in Java that significantly reduces the starting up time.  Many efforts have been made to maximize the generated Java lexer and parser performances, painstakingly line-by-line, case-by-case fine turning the lexer and parser code.  I believe that CookCC is the fastest lexer for Java (see the performance test). CookCC allows lexer/parser patterns and rules to be specified using Java annotation.  This feature greatly simplifies and eases the writing of lexer and parser for Java. Additionally, CookCC can produce highly compressed DFA tables. </p>

<p>CookCC requires JRE 1.5+ to run, but the generated Java code can be compiled and run with earlier versions of Java. </p>

<p>The current release is 0.3.3. </p>

<p>I am currently working on the island grammar on interfaces feature of 0.4, which is taking much longer than I anticipated. </p>

<p>Note: the BSD license only applies to CookCC itself.  The code generated belongs to you. </p>

<p>Road Map for 0.5add re2c-like direct code generation option for Lexer rather than only using table lookup (as of now). Possible mixed mode of execution to reduce table size (and code size), by reducing the number of states to be stored and possibly fewer equivalent classes. Performance gain for Java is questionable but I have thought out the way doing it. C and C++ code generation. More of the long term because right now I do not have need to do so.  The performance of flex for C is extremely difficult to beat anyways. What&#39;s New0.4 (Upcoming Release)added -extend option to set the parent class of the generated class updated debugLexer, debugLexerBackup, debugParser signature so that it is actually meaningful overload these debugging functions. &amp;nbsp;Issue 20&amp;nbsp;: allowed the start symbol to be specified in Java annotation input (by default it was the LHS of the first @Rule). Issue 19: allowed grammar on Java interfaces. &amp;nbsp;Issue 18&amp;nbsp;: added -generics option to generate Java code that use generics. &amp;nbsp;Issue 17&amp;nbsp;: added optional / optional list / list grammar shortcuts. Possible tree generator (grammar on Java annotations only) 0.3.3allowed the internal buffer to be automatically increased for long matches. &amp;nbsp;Issue 14&amp;nbsp;: added yyPushInput, yyPopInput, yyInputStackSize, yyWrap functions (and yywrap option). &amp;nbsp;Issue 13&amp;nbsp;: turn on backup lex state warning only when requested. &amp;nbsp;Issue 12&amp;nbsp;: added setBOL function to set the next token to be at BOL. &amp;nbsp;Issue 11&amp;nbsp;: yacc output does not have %start. &amp;nbsp;Issue 10&amp;nbsp;: yacc output fails on empty TokensDoc. 0.3.2added yacc grammar input and output. added yyPushLexerState and yyPopLexerState functions. added line number information for the error messages for Java input. added &quot;parserprolog&quot; section for the generated Java code. &amp;nbsp;Issue 9&amp;nbsp;: unable to handle &#39;\&#39;&#39; terminals in the grammar. &amp;nbsp;Issue 8&amp;nbsp;: incorrect lalr item lookahead calculation.  Now tested against bison using several major language grammars. &amp;nbsp;Issue 7&amp;nbsp;: disable APT compile for the CookCC Ant task to prevent class files from generated. &amp;nbsp;Issue 6&amp;nbsp;: erroneous warning of unreachable pattern when a lex pattern is shared among multiple lex states. &amp;nbsp;Issue 5&amp;nbsp;:  tag state attribute did not work. 0.3.1added single quoted literal string as lex patterns. 0.3added input using Java annotation. &amp;nbsp;Issue 2&amp;nbsp;: multiple incomplete state can cause internal lex error due to reassignment of the internal pattern case values. &amp;nbsp;Issue 1&amp;nbsp;: incorrectly generated parser if start non-terminal is not specified 0.2added parser generator. 0.1initial release.  Only includes lexer generator.</p>

 title : The Outline Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Outline is a template engine for php.</p>

<p>Unlike other template engines, Outline is fast and light by design - rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, this engine tries to leverage the power of the template engine you already know: php.</p>

<p>Outline implements a practical, familiar template syntax, in about 1000 lines of code, giving you close to all of the functionality found in major template engines such as Smarty, Template Lite or Savant.</p>

<p>Many commands have a considerably shorter syntax than any of the major template engines - and a syntax that more closely resembles php.</p>

<p>Outline takes the practical, simple parts of php syntax, simplifies the more complex parts of php syntax, and adds the most common template syntax elements from large engines.</p>

 summary : <p>The Dojo Toolkit Module integrates the Dojo Javascript Toolkit into a Drupal web application.  All jQuery dependent code on public facing pages has been re-written and extended in Dojo.  jQuery can then be excluded thus saving bandwidth and improves page load time. </p>

<p>The Dojo Toolkit Module includes a number of nice features including a rich-text editor on content creation pages.  There is a comprehensive administration area that allows you to create profiles for debugging and editor instances. </p>

<p>Current StatusWhile the Dojo Toolkit Module is amazing, it has become abandoned. I haven&#39;t had the time (or desire) to continue work on it.  The latest version is dated and written for Drupal 5.x and Dojo 1.0. </p>

<p>This project needs a new project lead, someone who cares enough to update it to the recent Drupal and Dojo releases.  If you think you&#39;re interested, please contact chris at cb1inc dot com and tell me you thoughts about this module and how you&#39;d like to help.</p>

<p>EvServer is created on top of the battle tested libevent library. It should be bleeding fast and reasonably stable. </p>

<p>The long term goal for this project, is to create a tool that will allow to easily create scalable comet/http push web applications. </p>

 title : The fdtkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of FDTKit is to help flash developers build and maintain a standard Eclipse/FDT environment through a centralized multi-platform toolkit of open source tools, libraries, scripts, templates and documentation. </p>

<p>While the toolkit is largely geared towards newcomers to Eclipse/FDT, and is some respects can be treated as a set of &#39;missing manuals and tools&#39;, the centralized collection of the various components that make up FDTKit should prove a worthwhile resource to anyone who desires a standardized central toolkit as a base for their IDE.  </p>

<p>In fact, FDTKit was created as I moved to (and learned) the Eclipse/FDT environment and desired to centralize the all the peripherals required to build a comfortable environment and keep them in sync between workstations via SVN. </p>

<p>FDTKit is distributed as an eclipse project via subversion which means you may Install FDTKit in to your existing eclipse/FDT environment or follow the Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide to get your new environment up and running, and then Install FDTKit. </p>

<p>Additionally, because FDTKit is delivered thru subversion which eclipse supports via the Subclipse plugin - you can easily install and update FDTKit in just a few clicks of eclipse. </p>

<p>The FDTKit repository can also be viewed with a web browser.  </p>

<p>Important update notice: - FDT 3 has been released by powerflashers. FDTKit is currently waiting for an Open Source Project license to be granted by PowerFlashers in order to complete the porting and documentation to this new version. FDTKit is now fully FDT3 compatible; while most of the wiki pages still hold true slight modifications will be made to bring them up to date shortly. More coming soon ....</p>
 title : The fh3jsvalidator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Look at http://fh3jsvalidator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ for the latest version (0.5a)!! The downloadable zip file can be out of date. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve created a new javascript validation script which validates form fields. The validator methods are ported from the PHP Formhandler project </p>

<p>The javascript syntax is pretty simple: </p>

<p>window.onload = function(){
<br/>	// Add the elements to the validator
<br/>	Var Validator = new jsValidator();
<br/>	Validator.elmts = {
<br/>		name: {
<br/>			validator: &#39;IsString&#39;,
<br/>			msg: &#39;This field must be a valid string&#39;
<br/>		},
<br/>		age: {
<br/>			validator: &#39;IsDigit&#39;,
<br/>			msg: &#39;This field must be a digit&#39;
<br/>		},
<br/>		description: {
<br/>			validator: &#39;_IsText&#39;,
<br/>			msg: &#39;This textarea can be empty, or must be a valid text&#39;
<br/>		}	
<br/>	}
<br/>	// Fire the validator
<br/>	Validator.init();
<br/>}you can also create your own validate functions or your own regular expression </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also created an extend class for formhandler to auto generate the validation code.</p>

 title : The formup Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>O que é ?FormUp é uma classe em ActionScript 2.0 para tratamento de formulários em Flash sem o uso de componentes. </p>

<p>Por que?Criada para facilitar o desenvolvimento de formulários, visto que isso é muito trabalhoso em alguns casos. FormUp permite que você apenas crie a interface do formulário, e se preocupe com as animações e interações. Bastando especificar os tipos de campos utilizados, e ela faz a validação, cria máscaras e outras coisas. O principal objetivo é nos livrar da mão de obra de tratar os formulários com máscara, validação, tabIndex e todo o tramite de  enviar, pegar respostas e todas essas coisas. Ela trata formulários de qualquer tipo, os tornam seguros, nos deixando livre para cuidar de animações cores e efeitos. </p>

<p>Como?A class é apenas uma abstração do uso do objeto sendAndLoad para funcionar de maneira genérica, desde um simples formulário de contato até um grande form de cadastro com todos os tipos de dados comuns (file, passwd, radio, check, text...). Usando os eventos é possível definir qualquer ação pro form de acordo com a interação do usuário. E também é possível usar o AMFPHP, a class FormAmfUp dá o suporte para usarmos o amfphp, seguindo as regras de sua documentação. Também podemos usar qualquer outra linguagem de web server-side (PHP, ASP, JSP) etc. </p>

<p>ExemploImportando e iniciando o objeto </p>

<p>import FlashForm.FormUp;</p>

<p>var meuForm:FormUp = new FormUp();Definindo campos e outros parametros </p>

<p>meuForm._arrayField[0] = {mc:&#39;nome&#39;, required:true};

 title : The google-documentation-reader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Reading web-based developer documentation is different than browsing typical web pages. As a developer, you probably refer to key technical doc many times per day, and you want it well-organized, easy to navigate, and -- above all -- fast. We&#39;re in the same boat! So we built a documentation viewer specially tailored for reading technical documentation. It works with any open source project hosted on Google Code. </p>

<p>You can use this documentation viewer as an easy way to read and author structured technical documentation. It builds on the existing wiki functionality available to every project hosted on Google Code. In addition to Google search, authors can easily define a table of contents and a list of index terms for their projects, providing readers with several ways to explore and understand complex technical material. </p>

<p>The structure of the documentation view helps readers quickly browse project documentation using a pleasant, unobtrusive user interface, designed with easy keyboard navigation, bookmarking and printing in mind. You can even combine projects together into a single documentation view by adjusting the URL to specify multiple projects, so you can look at several tables of contents, index entries, and search results all at once. </p>

 title : The informatica-powercenter-automation Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GoalThe goal of this project is to provide a library that will allow automatic generation and automatic changing of Informatica Powercenter ETL Mappings. </p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that after creating a handful of Informatica mappings, the process becomes very redundant. You may have also noticed that you&#39;re able to accomplish the task with little or no thought. The reason for this is that most mappings follow an existing pattern that you&#39;ve already learned, and are simply repeating with different inputs.  </p>

<p>The goal of this library is to provide the means to start to automate this mundane programming. If you&#39;re able to identify a pattern, you&#39;ll be able to code the pattern away reducing the cost of creating a mapping from days to minutes.  </p>

<p>Another common task is to change an Informatica Mapping. Something as simple as adding a column; can take hours or even days and may even prove error prone for large mappings. This library is able to read an existing Informatica Mapping, convert it into an object tree, allow your code to change it, and then spit it back out.  </p>

<p>As the library evolves, it will contain more and more patterns on top of the core automation library. Currently the only pattern included is adding a column to any mapping. If you build a pattern, and think it&#39;s reusable, send it to us, and we&#39;ll add it to the library.  </p>

<p>What about Mapfwk SDKSome of you maybe asking yourself, well, Informatica already provides a java automation library called mapfwk sdk. If you&#39;ve used it, you&#39;ll understand the need for a new  library. The mapfwk sdk is meant only for mapping generation, is quite obtuse, and not very well documented. Once you go beyond the obvious mapping, the SDK becomes extremely difficult to work with requiring, literally, decompiling of code.  </p>

<p>DesignThe core library consists of domain objects that represent the DTD provided by Informatica. The domain objects are mapped to the XML structure via JIBX. There is additional abstraction coded into the domain objects such as ability to treat target, source and transformation generically. On top of the core library, there are utility classes that codify common patterns, and actions.  </p>

<p>The library currently supports Informatica PowerCenter 8.1.1.</p>

 title : The jquery-domec Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jQuery DOM Elements Creator (DOMEC)DOM Elements Creator is a simple plugin for creating DOM elements on-a-fly which can be used as part of jQuery statements. </p>

<p>When you want to create new DOM element in pure jQuery you must use document.createElement() method and then new element must be wrapped in $() before it can be used in jQuery context. You can also use HTML code as a selector to create a new object but this way requires writing HTML, which is rarely comfortable. And you must also remember to escape any quotes. This plugin provides more elegant way to achieve the same effect and requires writing less code. </p>

<p>1.1 version releaseVersion 1.1 of the plugin has been released. It has some heavy API changes so for a few weeks older version will be supported as well. You should consider moving to new version because it offers some important improvements (like possibility to assign events when creating DOM elements). </p>

 summary : <p>This plugin integrates the Google Ajax Language API to jQuery. You can just call e.g. $(&#39;body&#39;).translate(&#39;en&#39;) but provides callbacks for each translated element too. Or you can pass an array to $.translate to get back a translated array. Currently you can only send a limited amount of characters with the raw API per request but this plugin calls them consecutively. It also reduces the number of requests by concatenating elements and doesn&#39;t send unnecessary html markup still providing access to each element as they&#39;ve got translated. </p>

 title : The ormer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ORMer is differs from other PHP ORM tools because it needs no XML config files and makes no assumptions about table/field names. Whenever possible it discovers row relations through foreign keys. </p>

<p>Before we begin: What&#39;s your ideal usage like for a supremely elegant PHP ORM tool? Be inspired, and perhaps give me feedback here. </p>

<p>FeaturesAutomatic relationship discovery through foreign keys (complete on SQLite2 and MySQL 5.1.10+) Give the coder the ability to specify relationships manually if he/she doesn&#39;t want to use foreign keys No assumptions about table or field names No requirements pertaining to table or field names; use your own conventions Simplest possible way of adding extra where clauses to use when pulling related data: method chaining (see examples) Step out of the way when you need to flex SQL skills that ORMer can&#39;t hack Act as if you&#39;re dealing with classes and objects rather than database records See it in actionWhat about: </p>

<p>$all_ordered_products = user::find()-&gt;orders-&gt;order_product-&gt;product;
<br/>foreach($all_ordered_products as $product) {
<br/>    echo $product-&gt;name;
<br/>}See some more examples </p>

<p>See the codeThere is a Mercurial repository available, so you can browse the code or checkout a copy. See the link to the right. </p>

<p>This project is seeking contributors. If you have some ideas about how ORM interaction should work, or want to dive into the nitty-gritty on a project whose code is intended to be readable and understandable by other developers, contact me. </p>

 title : The packmanutil Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introduction to PackManUtilPackManUtil is a command line application implemented through shell (BASH) scripts originally created for use with an x86_64 multilib Cross Linux from Scratch (CLFS) base system to simplify the build process for additional packages.  PackManUtil is written, tested, and used daily on x86_64 multilib, i586, and 32-bit PowerPC CLFS systems. </p>

<p>If you use PackManUtil, we&#39;d appreciate a quick e-mail letting us know what you think.  Even if you think PackManUtil stinks and is a waste of our time working on. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve also been picked up by Softpedia if you&#39;d like to write a review.  http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Software-Distribution/PackManUtil-41680.shtml </p>

<p>News2009-07-03 </p>

<p>Added the ability to strip installed binaries and libraries with the --stripit switch. Added new function to update build script directory using subversion with the --update switch. </p>

<p>2009-03-11 </p>

<p>Added md5sum checking capability for source tarballs. </p>

<p>2008-12-03 </p>

<p>Happy birthday to my wife.  Oh yeah, I also created a Google Group for PackManUtil.  Join us at http://groups.google.com/group/packmanutil?lnk=gcimh.  The mailing list is at packmanutil@googlegroups.com. </p>

<p>2008-11-08 </p>

<p>Released version 1.0.0.  This is considered the first stable release.  Please report any and all problems. </p>

<p>2008-10-13 </p>

<p>Please do not install NSPR using PackManUtil.  For some, as yet unknown, reason installing NSPR with PackManUtil may break your system&#39;s toolchain.  After installing NSPR the system reports a missing /lib64/libc.so.6 although the library is still there.  The NSPR build script has been removed from the SVN repository, but is part of the 0.9 release.  It will be removed from future releases if the problem cannot be fixed. </p>

<p>InstallationInstallation of PackManUtil is simple.  Most users will just execute the install.sh script found in the source directory.  For more details, visit our Installation Instructions. </p>

<p>ConfigurationAfter installing PackManUtil, configuration is accomplished by editing the build.cfg file.  There is a system-wide build.cfg file and each user can create their own in the ~/.packmanutil directory.  For more configuration details, visit our Configuration Instructions. </p>

<p>LoggingSeveral logs are created by PackManUtil during the build process.  One of these logs is /var/log/packmanutil/times.log.  This log keeps track of the time required to configure, make, make install, and total time for each package you install using PackManUtil.  If you set the SBU variable in build.cfg, then the SBU of each package will also be logged. </p>

<p>A database of build times is maintained by the PackManUtil developer.  We would appreciate you providing a copy of your times.log by e-mail so we can add your times to the database.  Once we have a sufficiently large data set, we will publish the information for everyone&#39;s use.  Of course, it is up to you. </p>

<p>See the Logging Wiki page for information we would request in addition to the file. </p>

 title : The plosxom Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionPlosxom is a blogsoftware written in PHP by Pali Dhar. It is a rewrite of phposxom. Blogposts are stored in textfiles, categories are simple directories. Plosxom has a comprehensive plugin api, which allows to add almost any functionality or to replace existing functionality. </p>

<p>DetailsPhposxom were itself a php rewrite of blosxom, but the developer has abandoned the project. I am using it, because I cannot run perl where my site is hosted and because it is small. However, the sourcecode of phposxom were nearly unmaintanable, inefficient and bad styled (sorry Robert). Since I use it on an every day basis, I decided to completely rewrite it. Plosxom was born. </p>

<p>Many of the blosxom forks out there have been abandoned too, especially the php ports (there are lots of it). None of them seemed to be a usefull base for me. Most of them justify their decision that if it were developed further it would become too far to existing projects like wordpress and they didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel. </p>

<p>While I share this view in general, I also see a lot of disadvantages with wordpress: its storage backend can&#39;t be replaced. It depends on MySQL, which is the worst database system on the planet. With plosxom you could write a sqlite backend or whatever you like, even a mysql backend. Wordpress is also a &quot;large biest&quot;, it contains a lot of source code and thus a lot of problems, especially from the security point of view. </p>

<p>Speaking of security - plosxom were developed with strong security in mind. Since there is almost no cgi input being used in the software, this goal were not difficult to achive. Everything which gets into the script will be filtered for bogus characters. Future attacks are hopefully prevented using this technique. </p>

<p>The plosxom core engine is very small. In fact, I wrote it in just two days. This sounds like a hell of a crap, but it isn&#39;t. Much functionality is provided by plugins, even core functions, such as text file management, is coded as a plugin. Since we are using smarty as our template engine there are endless possibilities to enhance plosxom. You can write a simple plugin along with a simple smarty function and that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>CommentsFor now, plosxom doesn&#39;t provide built-in comment support due to security reasons. Instead comments can be outsourced to Haloscan. However, perhaps someone will write a comment plugin some day, who knows. </p>

<p>Administering plosxomPlosxom can be maintained the traditional unix way on the commandline. Just ssh into your webservers shell account, cd to the data directory, mkdir a new one (viewed as category), cd into that new directory, vi a new file with .txt suffix, first line being the title, :x it and you&#39;re almost done. Of yourse you could also write a new posting on your local computer and upload it afterwards. </p>

<p>Adding images, installing templates or plugins - everything can be done from the commandline, you&#39;ll always keep full control over your blog. </p>

<p>However, for the lazy people out there, an administration webinterface exists as plugin too. From the admin webinterface you can add postings, install plugins or change the current template as easy as clicking the mouse. </p>

<p>For the curious - here is a screenshot of the admin backend in action </p>

<p>More InformationsDownload the latest version, Take a look at the documentation or browse the plugin-directory. </p>

<p>If you have questions post them to the Forum. </p>

<p>To get an idea of how it looks, visit the demo blog! </p>

 summary : <p>pod2gcwpod2gcw is a Perl script which converts Perl&#39;s POD documentation format into Google Code wiki markup. It is able, with a single invocation, to convert all the POD documentation in the trunk of a project into wiki pages. It is also able to generate cross-links between these pages using POD link markup. In other words, it wikifies your POD, giving you instant manpages! </p>

<p>For more detail, see the self-generated manual page for pod2gcw. </p>

<p>At this point, there is no official &quot;release&quot; of the software, thus no &quot;download&quot; tab. Instead, please check out the latest version from the trunk. There may never be an official &quot;release&quot; since the main target audience is people who are using Google Code, and they are already in a good position to check this file out and keep it up to date using subversion!</p>

 title : The Bin Packer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Qvol is a plugin based application for volume processing. It is built with a C backend for creating specialized code such as tomographic reconstruction algorithms and segmentation algorithms. It is composed of the main application with a generic plugin interface for documents, views, and processes. </p>

<p>Examples of documents are volumes, histograms, and meshes. Volumes can also extend other documents for example a Dicom document extends a Volume Document. </p>

<p>Views are associated with documents and may also extend other views. For example ClinicalVolumeViewer contains 3 instances of volumeviewer. </p>

<p>Processes can extend the funcationality of a document or process multiple documents. An example is VolumeProjector which projects a volume onto an image (ie: a volume of size XxYx1). Another exmaple of a process is volumetomesh3dprocess which converts a volume to a 3D tetrahedral mesh. </p>

<p>The alpha release of qvol is planned for release in July or August of 2008</p>

 summary : <p>The usage of semantic web services in enterprise computing promises many advantages. Instead of hard-wiring web services in business processes during design-time, business experts just specify the expected functionality and matching semantic web services are bound automatically during runtime. However, the introduction of semantic web services requires the replacement or extension of existing middleware and standards. We suggest a more realistic approach based on existing standards like BPEL. Therefore we introduce the Semantic Invocation Service (SISi), which handles semantic web service calls.</p>

 summary : <p>What? </p>

<p>Shuriken is an ActionScript 2 component framework created to enable developers to create applications for mobile devices that support Flash Lite 2 (phones/mobiles, Chumby, Windows Mobile, etc.). </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>There is currently no component framework for Flash Lite 2.  The existing Flash MX 2004, Flash 8, and Flex 1.5 components do not work in Flash Lite 2.  While it is basically Flash Player 7, the devices it runs on cannot handle the CPU &amp; memory requirements. </p>

<p>How? </p>

<p>Shuriken&#39;s goals are, in order of importance: </p>

<p>work on the lowest common denominator; if it can run Flash Lite 2, the component framework should work. provide commonly required GUI components &amp; utility classes while being easy for developers to extend. no styling or skinning code; developer / designer is responsible for decorating and/or changing base skin symbols.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the game - a random sequence of tetrominoes (shapes composed of four square blocks each) fall down the playing area. The object of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing area and no additional tetrominoes are able to enter. </p>

 summary : <p>Tuntun is an applet for Gnome panel written in Vala and it can manage a list of vpn connections through the OpenVPN Management Interface. It&#39;s a rewrite and a replacement of my ovpnClient and it implements some items that were on ovpnClient todo list. </p>

<p>Main featuresSimple &amp; lightweight just a client GUI to start/stop your OpenVPN tunnels and nothing more Integrated with the Gnome Desktop (support for the Keyring and notification daemon) Support for Auth and Private-Key OpenVPN authentication methods Note </p>

<p>Although Tuntun was written in Vala you will need the valac compiler only if you want to contribute to the project or compile it from svn. Since valac compiler just translate vala code to straight C code + GObject, every Tuntun release will build and install with only gcc. Just do: </p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/usr --libexec=/usr/lib/gnome-applets 
<br/>./make 
<br/>./make install 
<br/>Beside that I advise you to try Vala because it&#39;s just a more fun and productive way to write programs that integrate well in the Gtk+ and Gnome technologies. </p>

 summary : <p>tvdblib is a library written in c# .net which allows pulling information through the api provided at http://thetvdb.com .  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To demonstrate the features and usage of the library, the program TvBrowser allows you to browse through the shows available on thetvdb and watch all available content. </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>The features covered by the library at the moment are: </p>

<p>series information episode information caching of downloaded data save to xml files save to serialized files updating of cached data banners (including thumbnails) series season episode fanart poster actors add/remove user favorites user ratings actors information zipped downloading </p>

<p>If you find any bugs, do not hesitate to post them within the &quot;Issues&quot; section. </p>

<p>.::News::.Version 0.7 (2009-06-18)Because of a few open bugs I decided on releasing a new version, even though no major new features have been added. The most noticable changes are: </p>

<p>fixed all known bugs Sorting of episodes (aired, dvd, absolute) Running Updates can be aborted A few new properties (e.g. ContainsSeriesName at TvdbFanartBanner) </p>

<p>Version 0.6 (2009-02-14)The version 0.6 offers a heavily redone update and caching mechanism and a differentiation between TvdbDownloader and TvdbHandler. </p>

<p>Redone caching mechanism: Improved performance and much lower memory consumption TvdbDownloader: Only download informations from http://thetvdb.com TvdbHandler: Download and handle (cache, update, etc.) the downloaded data Improved update mechanism All banners (except actors) support thumbnails </p>

<p>You can download the new version from here </p>

<p>Version 0.5This version adds the new api features to get all rated series for a user, get all rated items from a series and the episode lookup using the air-date. </p>

<p>A few minor bugfixes where made and the TvBrowser app now has the ability to store the user identifier.  </p>

<p>Version 0.4Version 0.4 implements all features offered by the API. It also fixes a lot of bugs of the previous versions. Language handling is much improved now as well as downloading updates for cached content.</p>

<p>This software allows self-paced reading and speeded acceptability judgment tasks to be run online through a web browser. The server is written in Python and stores results in a CSV file, suitable for later analysis using R, Matlab, etc. There is some reasonably comprehensive documentation at Documentation. </p>

<p>A beta of version 0.3 is now available. As of this release, the software has been renamed to &quot;Ibex&quot; (&quot;Internet Based EXperiments&quot;). Documentation for this release is at Documentation03. This new version is significantly easier to deploy, since it requires only  Python &gt;= 2.3 and the modules that are bundled with it (the dependency on the &quot;paste&quot; module has been removed). There are a few other minor user-visible improvements, but the main focus of 0.3 has been improving the code structure using jQuery, and making it easier to automatically deploy Ibex (for the Ibex Farm). </p>

<p>WxPita has two main goals:  </p>

<p>Allow the structure of your layout code to correspond more closely to the structure of your GUI Allow event callbacks to be bound and defined in a single step By accomplishing these two goals, wxPita lets you write simpler, more maintainable GUI code. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at a simple example: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The code for this example: </p>

<p>from wxpita import *
<br/>import time</p>

<p>f = SizedFrame [
<br/>    Button(name=&#39;btn1&#39;, label=&#39;Button 1&#39;),

<br/>    
<br/>    f.textc.AppendText(text)</p>

<p>f.Show(&quot;A Simple WxPita Example&quot;, size=(400,250))Compare with the equivalent code, written using wxPython: </p>

<p>import wx

<p>app = wx.PySimpleApp()
<br/>frame = sc.SizedFrame(None, title=&quot;A Simple WxPython Example&quot;)
<br/>panel = frame.GetContentsPane()</p>

<p>btn1 = wx.Button(panel, label=&#39;Button 1&#39;)</p>

<p>btn2 = wx.Button(panel, label=&#39;Button 2&#39;)</p>

<p>textc = wx.TextCtrl(panel, style=wx.TE_MULTILINE)

 summary : <p>Yay! MockA standalone mock object library for PHP 5 (based on jMock)Yay! Mock aims to be a test framework-independent mock object library with the most flexibility possible.  Based on jMock (Java) it makes expectations based on Invocation signatures rather than just on method names and/or call timings. </p>

<p>Mock objects only contain the methods of the original type they mock.  In other words, mock objects created with Yay! Mock do not have any expectation methods embedded inside them; instead they &quot;record&quot; invocations to the context in which they were created. </p>

<p>Yay! Mock encourages dependency injection and loose coupling without pushing you into corners of testing implementation details.  It works with any unit testing framework. </p>

<p>Particular features includeMock interfaces (preferred) or classes Object identities via type-hints remain integral Expect invocations based on signatures Specify return values for specific invocation signatures Specify actions to perform on specific invocation signatures Match signatures loosely based on various Matchers Expect invocations when the environment is in a specific state Expect sequences of Invocations Yay! Mock code (like jMock) is intended to be easy to learn and to understand when read.  The code written within test cases is very fluent and expressive. </p>

<p>This is how it works. </p>

<p>Lucy for each of the forty websites researches and sets-up tasks and lists the websites, serach terms, forums and user names, facebook, myspace and other social network contacts, scanned physical media where content can be found for each website. </p>

<p>Carol goto the 40 websites task admin website, login and then select a website from the menu on the home page. </p>

<p>She goes to the website task list page. </p>

<p>This page list tasks and sources of content for that particular website. </p>

<p>She clicks on the first task, &quot;Search google&quot; and then clicks sub-task &quot;use search term for tube reasons to be careful&quot;. </p>

<p>She does the tasks and adds the content to another database she has open, the content admin for 40 websites (Casper is working on this). </p>

<p>She then goes and clicks the next task and so on. </p>

<p>She then works out a new task so she adds it to the data base.  First the task as text written instruction then the url to click on.  She then adds several sub tasks consiting of search terms for the website, user name, password and specific threads. </p>

<p>She spends an hour going through the task list, finding content and adding it to this other database. </p>

<p>She also updates the task admin database when ever she finds a new source of content. </p>

<p>Some of the content she finds from memory as she is familiar with updating this particular website. </p>

<p>At the end of the hour she moves on to update anothe website. </p>

<p>And so it goes until she has done her 20 hours updating 20 websites. </p>

<p>Lucy checks the task database for every website to add new tasks and delete out of date or poorly performing tasks. </p>

<p>So as you can see the task admin database is a simple to do list that should take about a week to develop using active scaffold. </p>

<p>It can then be used to find and store the knowledge of where to find content from for the forty websites. </p>

<p>Specification </p>

<p>Data Model We have: </p>

<p>websites Tasks Sub Tasks Websites have the following information  as a minimum: </p>

<p>Name Description url Name of editor Name of sub editor Mission -  why we have a website and why anyone should bother visiting it Editors weekly comment - e.g. We need more content last week you only update 3 pages. I know you can do better than that Susie.  Lucy Tasks have the following information as a minimum: </p>

<p>Task e.g. goto facebook and pick out the best posting from the &quot;best chat up lines&quot; group and similar groups. Editors comments e.g. This tasks is working really well, good work - Lucy Sub Tasks have the following information as minimum: </p>

<p>content url user name password search term Description of content e.g. anything that looks new and interesting on the page. Comment All fields do not have to be filled in.  So a google search term would only have google as url and search term as e.g &quot;what annoys me&quot;, and description of new postings. </p>

<p>In addition to the tasks admin database Susie and Carol would have access to a google email account which contains &quot;Google alerts&quot; etc. </p>

<p>The point of the task admin database is that in accumulates knowledge so that if Susie leaves and Tracey takes over she can immediately see where to get content from for each website. </p>

<p>Controllers </p>

<p>CRUD (create, can&#39;t remember what R stands for look it up, Update, Delete) </p>

<p>Search and Navigation including nested AS </p>

<p>Views </p>

<p>Simple views that are easy to use</p>

 title : The actsasreplica Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>With the current trend of offline applications and solutions as Joyent Slingshot or Rails2Exe to run a stand-alone offline client app written in Rails, we end up having a problem ahead of us: offline data gathering and synchronization back and forth to a main online server. </p>

<p>There is virtually no solution for that matter unless you use some proprietary and expensive package. Google Gears comes to mind but it acts more like a static client-side caching providing no real replication of data. So &#39;acts_as_replica&#39; was really made to scratch my own itch. </p>

<p>It was made for the scenario where you will have several clients working in an offline environment and then they&#39;ll connect at the end of the day to get new data from the server and also send back what it collected through out the day. </p>

<p>This is a very opinionated software, meaning that it was not made to cover every single synchronization scenario in the world, but small and mid-sized solutions should benefit. It uses HTTP to wire both peers and up until now formats the payload packages in YAML. </p>

<p>This plugin was very influenced by the plugin acts_as_syncable by Alex MacCaw. Actually I used his code as the initial structure but it&#39;s now very far departure from his original view. </p>

<p>This project was done under the support of my current employer, Surgeworks. I am not done yet, so this is a work in progress. Any collaboration and ideas will be welcome. </p>

<p>Read the HowToInstall, MustRead and HowToTest Wiki Pages for more information. And don&#39;t forget to download the Example Project so you can have a faster hands on.  </p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, doubts, ideas contact me at fabio.akita@surgeworks.com. </p>

<p>Apr, 3rd, 2008 - Moving to GitI am abandoning Subversion management. I will leave this homepage behind but the source code here is frozen. Newer updates will be only at Github. </p>

<p>http://github.com/akitaonrails/acts_as_replica/tree/master </p>

<p>I am very late updating this code, sorry for that, I will try to make it more user friendlier now. </p>

<p>Sep, 23th, 2007 - Lots of ChangesI just uploaded a batch of new features and bug fixes to the plugin. I finally had time to test it further and I am much more confident about it. </p>

<p>The Sync table was renamed to Replica - the daemons plugin seems to complain with this name Added RemoteMachine table. Now the handshake process exchange Machine IDs (UUID), and the new Replica table keeps track of each machine_id. That way, the transactions are no longer bound to a single User in a single client App. The same username can be used in any client installation and still be able to safely replicate data back and forth. The client and server no longer uses a timestamp (in the last_synced columns of User and RemoteClient) to track each others transaction log entry points. It has been replaced for a simple auto-increment integer number (the primary key for the new Replica table). syncable.yml was deprecated in favor of a SyncSetting singleton Model. You will have to create your own administration screen, though. It was asserted that SSL connection do works Created a proper script/generator instead of the old manual file copy operation. I deprecated the use of the old Engine plugin because it was too buggy with dependency loading. Added support for background jobs triggered through a controller. Sample controller and views included. It is cross platform as well. In nix I use the good ol&#39; system() call and in Win32, the Process.create method. You can control what&#39;s happening tailing the log/replica.log file Added experimental application self-upgrade. lib/daemons/upgrade.rb is a new background job that calls svn cleanup, svn update and rake db:migrate. That way the application can be updated remotely without direct SSH connection to the server Batch control was finalized and tested: the syncs_helper.rb now implements a run_sync method that controls run_upload and run_download. Each can read its local batch_limit settings (see SyncSetting). Then it can retrive XX number of rows at a time. This can be used to refine transfer using slow connections, so to avoid timeouts. Jul, 8th 2007 - New Project MemberI just added Marcus Derencius, a good friend of mine, as a contributor. He pointed out somethings that we could add to this project: </p>

<p>The User class is hardcoded. We need to make this configurable to allow for other authentication plugins that doesn&#39;t use a model named &#39;User&#39; Generate automated RDoc documentation Add support for Rake tasks. And actually Slingshot expects to find a :up and :down tasks in its GUI Devise some cronjob like scheduled task to actively check whether the network is on or not and automatically start replication in the background, thus avoiding having to replication too big packages only at the end of the day Put in some connection checking before starting the &#39;perform_sync&#39; process. If you start it without having the server part online, the client process simply hangs and you have to forcefully kill it. Jul, 17th 2007 - Merged with UserstampI realized that the vanilla Userstamp plugin doesn&#39;t work properly with this plugin. Until I devise a better way, I merged the userstamp.rb in the lib folder of the plugin. The belongs_to proxy method fails in some cases and the usage of the UUID can conflict as well. So delete the original userstamp plugin and use the one in this plugin.</p>

 title : The boundary-generator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a simple geoprocessing tool that extracts adjacency information from a layer of polygons. The output is a polyline layer with one record for each border between each pair of neighboring polygons. </p>

<p>Download v. 0.1. </p>

<p>After downloading and installing, you can right-click on a new toolbox, choose &quot;Add -&gt; Tool&quot;, and select Boundary Generator under the &quot;MWSW Geoprocessing Tools&quot; group. You can also find MWSW Boundary Generator on the &quot;Index&quot; toolbox view. </p>

<p>Highly recommended: Send a blank email to mwsw-prod-announce-subscribe@googlegroups.com to receive announcements about this and other projects. (You can also sign up via the web). Your email address will never be shared with anyone. </p>

<p>Project status (alpha): </p>

<p>Generating boundaries works; initial spot checks are giving correct answers. Some of the Geoprocessing UI behavior isn&#39;t quite finished -- e.g., you must specify the output location yourself; the tool gives an erroneous validation error if you try to run it on a layer that isn&#39;t in your TOC. (Expect these to be fixed soon.)  The tool hasn&#39;t really been tested in a model builder / python scripting framework yet, and needs some adjustments to work well there. Project rationale: </p>

<p>It is a good demonstration project for custom programming geoprocessing tools in C#, as well as simple computational geometry &amp; spatial indexing techniques. It is robust and geometry based; the other extensions I&#39;ve come across for doing the same thing simply searched for line segments with identical endpoints (and would thus fail with partial overlaps, T junctions, numeric precision issues, and the like) or used polygon-polygon intersection to come up with polygon adjacency lists (but not accurate border lines), as described in this old article. This functionality is available without an ArcInfo license. (If you do have ArcInfo, you can use the offical Polygon To Line tool. I would be curious to see the results of a side-by-side comparison from someone with a license...) If you are still using ArcView 3.x, my (dated and not well-tested; beware!) Avenue script for doing the same thing is available at http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12786.</p>

 title : The jsf-toolkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The JSF Toolkit is a full-cycle component creation, management, and delivery framework for JSF 1.2. The JSF-Tk seeks to be a model for the implementation of components with the goals of interoperability and AJAX framework independence, while simultaneously integrating seamlessly and automatically with the developer&#39;s chosen framework and JSF implementation. </p>

<p>News30 Oct 2007 - We&#39;re an open source project! Yay! Seeking developers, users, and fans. Please let us know on the mailing list if you&#39;ve tried it, and what your experience was. Thanks! </p>

<p>Why do I need a framework for developing JSF components?To answer that question, first decide: What kind of component developer are you? </p>

<p>Experienced Web Developer - 0 Experience with JSF or Java. You know CSS, Javascript, etc. pretty well. You can do amazing things with DHTML.  Probably you use a Mac, although if you don&#39;t, you probably want one.  You somehow heard about this JSF thing and that it had reusable components and liked the idea of having one of your creations be used by thousands of web sites. JSF Application Developer - You use JSF to produce web applications, you&#39;ve never written a custom component, but you&#39;re otherwise pretty familiar with JSF. You&#39;re here because you want to reuse code and make your application more maintainable. Experienced Component Developer - You&#39;ve written JSF components and generally know what you&#39;re doing.  You&#39;re here because you&#39;re tired of the tedium that goes into creating a component.  You want to be able to prototype, create, and deliver custom components more quickly.  You also want to ensure that your components are usable with a variety of JSF frameworks, toolkits and other component libraries. It may be that you&#39;re somewhere in between as well.  That&#39;s fine, all our lessons move incrementally, so you can find a level you&#39;re comfortable with. </p>

<p>How do I use this thing?Choose a guide </p>

<p>Component Developer - You want to create components. Read the NewComponentDeveloperGuide. Component User - You just want to use one or more components created with the JSF Toolkit in your application. (UsersGuide coming soon)</p>

<p>NOTE: DarkGDK is not free for commercial applications. (e.g. To sell a game you make) there is a special license fee required that needs to be paid to The Game Creators (aka TGC).  </p>

<p>Prerequisites Microsoft Windows XP or Vista  DirectX 9.0c Aug 2007 SDK  Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++ Express or Other  DarkGDK Game Development Kit - From theGameCreators Optional DarkPhysics - From theGameCreators  Sparky&#39;s Collision DLL InstallationDownload the archive, unarchive the download, open JegasLLC.sln (Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Solution File), from the Visual Studio Tree, open a branch of any demo, click green run arrow, it should compile and run for you. </p>

<p>Developer NotesRead the release notes! Each Demo has a !readme.txt and there is an extensive one in both the GameClasses and FoundationClasses Projects that more or less map out this development system. </p>

<p>Every effort has been made to try and write neat, efficient, and human readbale code.  There are some things that would be considered not main stream. In short, I wrote my own versions of classes that are available in the STDLIB and they have been performing solidly, so I&#39;m sticking with them.  </p>

<p>ALL COMMENTS Welcome - and I have a &quot;Self Tester&quot; for the FoundationClasses project where the idea is without such a tool for these core routines and classes it can be much harder to understand where something has gone wrong. This self tester tells you if the FoundationClasses are intact and working as epected. This self tester&#39;s source code also serves as a good demo/tutorial program to see how things work. </p>

<p>JGC Library comes with a small subset of media so you actually see something when it compiles for you. I really was trying to keep the media down as previous releases it was just to much for people to download to just &quot;take&#39;r for a spin&quot;. </p>

<p>Note, development has been ongoing for some time and this library is starting to mature. It&#39;s not a finished system, however its PACKED with easy to use and understand classes for almost all the major entities in DarkGDK -- and some new additional surprises are in there for those who dig in. Like Bitmap Fonts, a DirectX Rendered GUI, The JMesh and VMesh &quot;terrain systems&quot; and some others. </p>

 summary : <p>A general purpose collection of game engine components. It is intended that these components are able to be composed together to create a game and engine without much coder effort after the fact. </p>

<p>We will rely heavily on object orientation, and design patterns, and focus toward data driven configuration and composition of components within the organisation of the framework.</p>

 summary : <p>OverviewHmm... not so much anymore. Moved onto relearning that whole web thing: </p>

<p>http://www.shareplaylearn.net/ </p>

<p>Been a few years.. (5-6).. odd what&#39;s changed and what hasn&#39;t.. </p>

<p>This is now mainly offsite storage of the site&#39;s code. Nothing exciting, just learning AppEngine and GWT (which is exciting, if my code is not :P). Note that the website code is NOT covered by the same license as the project code. </p>

<p>Keeping this stuff just coz: </p>

<p>Create a 3D world of evolving creatures. (yet another one) </p>

<p>Runs evolver, interpreter, physics as separate processes that talk to each other via sockets. Client does rendering, and possibly physics. Hope to factor out physics to separate process. </p>

<p>Currently the system evolved is an lsystem, and it is interpreted as a sequence of points in 3D space. </p>

<p>Note that the Source tab is now irrelevant: all code drops are done via downloads, and the tree is no longer updated. This is due to the fact that I use git on my local machine for version control, and it is rather awkward to try to use two different version control systems for the same code. </p>

<p>Works on linux with Ogre, ODE, OIS, and boost. </p>
