 title : The plazes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Plazes ProjectThe Plazes.net website and API service are ceasing operation as of August 15, 2008With the acquisition of Plazes by Nokia now complete the Plazes development team is concentrating its resources building something new within Nokia, and it&#39;s very likely that the structure of the Plazes API will change significantly. </p>

<p>As such, the Plazes.net website and the Plazes.net API will cease operation on August 15, 2008.The Plazes.com site, and the Plazes.com API, will remain in operation for the time-being. </p>

<p>Plazes is a geopresence service with a rich API that affords the ability to build applications and mashups that are &quot;geo-aware.&quot;   </p>

<p>Plazes consists of a consumer web application, Plazes.com, and a developer-focused geopresence engine, Plazes.net. </p>

<p>This project is a home for open source code that uses the Plazes API, as well as a place for developers to document applications, obtain sample code, and obtain answers to questions. </p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to this project -- to use it to host code, to contribute to the wiki, etc. -- just send an email to plazes.advocate@gmail.com. </p>

 summary : <p>A framework written in Javascript to build Web 2.0 GUIs with full draggable content windows. The solution is exensible by building custom &#39;snapIns&#39; that can simply be build using Javascript. However there are already snapIns for content (IFRAMES), embedding (Flash etc.) included in the package. All content will be displayed in &#39;snapIns&#39; - small windows that snap (or dock) into a portals predefined layout (which also is customizable). </p>

<p> IMPORTANT NOTES: The framework currently uses YUI (YAHOO User Interface) Framework Version &gt; 2.5.0 which is required to run the portal. Please download it from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ [This dependency will be removed from one of the next releases to make the 2112PowerWindows Framework independend from any other source. </p>

<p>The current version uses PHP Scripts for AJAX Calls, including the Snoopy Class PHP. All files are included in the download package. See sourceforge.net/projects/snoopy/ for details.    </p>

<p>LICENSING: </p>

<p>Please note that 2112PowerWindows is built on a pluggable architecture. Only the Core runtime files are Open Source and released by 2112Portals under the GNU Public License. Any pluggable snapIns - from 2112Portals or third party companies - may use different licensing and therefore will not be available in source code. Also note that the solution uses Tim Taylor Consultings &#39;toolman&#39; drag and drop library which has its own (free) licensing (see tool-man.org) for more details. We therefore can not grant a GPL for this libraries. </p>

<p>Pycoon is a Python WSGI web development framework which allows XML processing pipelines to handle HTTP requests based on URI pattern matching. It is similar in intention to the Apache Cocoon framework. Pycoon uses sitemap file format compatible with Apache Cocoon Sitemap 1.0. </p>

<p>The architecture of Pycoon focuses on: </p>

<p>Full sitemap file format compatibility with Apache Cocoon Heavy usage of WSGI modularity ideas Simplicity of deployment Optimization issues Pycoon is a WSGI middleware that dispatches requests based on Apache Cocoon sitemap logic. Data is processed by an XML pipeline composed of several WSGI applications and middleware components. An HTTP server WSGI interface and it&#39;s implementations (Pycoon front-end) are already complete. WSGI interfaces of sitemap components and implementations of them (Pycoon back-end) are in progress. </p>

 title : The Sked Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>QtWeb Internet BrowserPortable Qt-based web browser. Customizable GUI. Privacy features.QtWeb is a fast, portable and lightweight browser with some unique UI and privacy features. QtWeb is an open source project based on Nokia&#39;s Qt framework (former Trolltech) and Apple&#39;s WebKit rendering engine (the same as being used in Apple Safari and Google Chrome). </p>

<p>Use ScenariosLimited Windows environment (Windows booting and running from CD / DVD / USB Flash - WinPE, BartPE) Portable scenarios (minimum dependencies, can be run directly from CD or USB, with no installation is required)  Strong Privacy required (no traces of browsing to be left while browsing or on the local machine after browser has been reset)  Clean browsing environment (all toolbars, including navigation bar, can be turned off or moved outside the main browsing window)  Multimedia machines (Virtual Keyboard supported, simple and convenient mouse navigation, all functions easy access) Major FeaturesCustomizable User Interface </p>

<p>Change Application Style on the fly, and see how the program and websites look under different versions of Windows and Unix environment Move Navigation Bar and Bookmarks Bar anywhere within a mainframe, or even undock and place them on the Desktop Customize web search providers, menu titles, assign hot keys and your favorite shortcuts to any menu commands Show/Hide toolbar buttons and toolbars themselves (Menu Bar, Navigation Bar, Status Bar, Bookmarks Bar, Tab Bar)  Tabbed browsing by default. User Interface can be switched to non-tabbed Privacy and Security features Turn on Private Browsing mode to avoid leaving traces of browsing, even UserAgent which is being sent to the web server is masked Easy access to most privacy functions via toolbar buttons, Privacy menu and customizable keyboard shortcuts Full Reset feature - clears all caches and restores all local settings to the state just after installation, as it was never run on the machine   Supported SSL to access secure sites. Certificate information and certification path can be displayed AdBlock function allows to hide most disturbing advertisements and block web counters which slow down browser&#39;s performance while webpage loading Lightweight, fast and portable browser Size of executable is 4MB only, no additional DLLs and other configuration files required Single EXE file - QtWeb.exe can be copied and run from USB Scripting support allows any web page (including JavaScripted ones) to be loaded and dumped into a file from a command line Can be run in limited Windows environment (Win PE), like Active@ Boot Disk, or BartPE running from CD/DVD/USB  More... HTML 5, CSS, Frames, JavaScript, Cookies, Bookmarks, History, Passwords, Mouse Gestures, Media content - all essential browser features are here Web Inspector allows to view and inspect HTML elements, debug JavaScripts, view loading time and profile resources Supported FTP browsing and downloading AutoFill option - stores and pre-populates user names and passwords for the sites you visit most With Qt 4.5 supported Netscape plugins, like Adobe Flash Player, QuickTime or MediaPlayer Includes built-in Torrent client being able to download files via fastest torrents protocol </p>

<p>Bugs against Apple&#39;s WebKit should be filed in the webkit bugzilla: https://bugs.webkit.org/  </p>

<p>News29.3.2010 - Hardware virtualization and emulation based sandboxing for web renderingI have been playing with the idea of having the web rendering 
<br/>processes running in an Linux environment inside QEmu/VMware -image. I 
<br/>have been looking for the IPC documentation of the Chromium browser as 
<br/>it would make sense just to separate the existing codebase to 
<br/>different packages and then handle the IPC over TCP/IP. The benefit in 
<br/>this would be that there could be a really good protection against 
<br/>malware and other evil apps from the user point of view. As the idea 
<br/>would be that each tab would have its own virtual computer and when 
<br/>the tab is closed the virtual computer is deleted. 
<br/>Another thing is that the firewall bypassing which is now reality with 
<br/>web browsers would limit to the virtual machine and the client machine 
<br/>would be safe, including the personal files. One benefit would be also 
<br/>that the antivirus applications and system monitoring could be running 
<br/>inside those virtual machines, which would mean also that you could 
<br/>assign browsing related scanning resource usage to the minimum. 
<br/>Or you could have the browser sessions for example in Amazon Web 
<br/>Services which would mean that next time you would recover full 
<br/>sessions on browser startup and the sessions would not be dependent of 
<br/>the location/machine. This would also enable real background 
<br/>downloading while the laptop is shutdown. </p>

<p>I guess I could clarify my dumb question a bit more :P ..so the 
<br/>document in the http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/inter-process-com... 
<br/>states that in Unix Chromium used socketpair and in Windows it uses 
<br/>named pipes. So at least in theory the Unix side should be easy to 
<br/>change and I guess in the windows side some kind of named pipe to tcp/ 
<br/>ip service should be doneMore at Chromium-discuss  29.3.2010 - New Wiki page for Electronics and RoboticsElectronicsAndRobotics </p>

<p>IdeasLatestTBD </p>

<p>Ideas Before 2010Yet another poker project idea..a php/python backend, ajax frontend. Online anonymous poker game where all the hands in the games are stored in database backend. All games can be browsed afterwards online. Shows also possibilities of the next coming hands based on game history. Database would have also json interface for 3rd party apps and statistics. The possibility to integrate the system to facebook should also be researched. It would be fun to challenge your contact to a poker game, where the game is not played realtime but as turnbased like some roleplaying games. </p>

<p>a web spiderwhich will crawl websites and &quot;clicks&quot; ads and banners. Supports blacklist from adblock. If everybody would use this and adblock at the same time, in some point the ads wouldnt exist anymore. :) ..to be honest, this would work when it would be done like the Seti@Home. Everyone would run the software when they arent using their own www-connection and after awhile there wouldnt be any profit to buy web-ad-space :P  </p>

<p>Image Sharing softwaresoftware will create a packaged list of your shared pics and uses thumbnails. Shares that package thru network to your contacts. Contacts will request for an update of the packaged list. Contacts will then browse your pictures and ask for full pictures. Purpose of the software is to provide an easy-sharing method for normal computer users instead of email. </p>

 summary : <p>Quick Windows Apt toolsWhy QWinApt?I like ubuntu&#39;s Install/Uninstall tools very much. Hope to find a same tool under windows, but there is none. so, I deside to write a application by myself. </p>

<p>It will be simple, and enhance step by step. </p>

<p>for some personal reason, I use C# and .net2.0. </p>

<p>Ubuntu Like GUI Easy Use Most of Green and Free softwares Free ToolsQWinAptClientLike Ubuntu&#39;s install tool. It load Data from DB file. You can use it to download applications, or delete applications that you have already downloaded.Because Windows&#39;s installation is totally different from Linux&#39;s. So it only download file for you, you can install it as your like. 
<br/>QWinAptConfigToolYou can use this tool to config your own DB file. Actually I will use it to maintain the main   DB file on this server. I&#39;m also glad to receive users&#39; config file that make by this tool, then I could easy to merge it with main DB file. 
<br/>QWinAptParserI use it(these) to create DB file from other page. 
<br/>You can download source code in source tunck. </p>

<p>UsageDownload filesDownload files from this page, includes QWinApt-x.x.x.zip(Main Client Application),wget.zip(if you don&#39;t have one),zh-CN.zip(if you are Chinese user). 
<br/>Install itIt is totally Green, just extract to you disk.If you also downloaded zh-CN.zip, put the folder zh-CN in the same directory with WinApt.Client.exe.If you downloaded wget.zip, put wget.exe in system %PATH% so the application can find it. 
<br/>Need to KnowIf you run it at first time, it will: 
<br/>Popup to request a simple config, which let you chose the base directory that need to save the downloaded files. Download DB file from Project Home, so make sure your NetWork works fine. You can Update DB file by click Update button in Main Form. When you finish download a file, click it with right mouse button, then you can explore it or install it. See pictures follow.

 summary : <p>RichBlocksFramework para implantar uma interface rica em sistemas/aplicações webO Framework foi criado baseado na metodologia RIA (Rich Internet Applications), isso significa que a aplicação web se comporta de maneira semelhante a uma aplicação desktop. A arquiteruta do Framework funciona com o padrão de menus e janelas. </p>

<p>Cada menu possui a referência de uma janela, e ao ser clicado executa uma função que a abre. </p>

<p>A plataforma do framework também suporta menus de botão direito. Todos os menus e janelas são definidos em arquivos XML. </p>

<p>Objetivo: O objetivo do Framework é integrar uma interface rica baseada na metodologia RIA em sistemas/aplicações web. </p>

<p>Linguagens: HTML,Javascript,XML,CSS </p>

<p>Plataformas: Mozilla Firefox  2.0+, Internet Explorer 6.0+, Chrome 1.0 +, Safari  2.0 +, Opera 8.0 + </p>

<p>Funcionamento: O núcleo do Framework é constituído de bibliotecas Javascript e arquivos XML. O Javascript renderiza a interface fazendo uma leitura nos arquivos XML, que são previamente &quot;populados&quot; com todas as informações necessárias para o funcionamento do sistema integrado com a interface. </p>

 summary : <p>Cada vez mais a informação se torna importante na vida das pessoas. Hoje estar bem informado é crucial ao ser humano, uma simples informação pode desde salvar vidas ate instigar guerras. A ciência da informação visa disponibilizar meios aos quais se possa disponibilizar informações de forma rápida a quem necessita delas. Sejam cálculos extremamente complexos ou  noticias do dia a dia. Muitas empresas tem a necessidade de disseminar conteúdo entre seus colaboradores, clientes, gerentes etc. Uma solução encontrada são os publicadores de conteúdo, sistemas informatizados que visam prover conteúdo estático e dinâmico através de intranets, extranets, internet dispositivos de comunicação portáteis e ate mesmo outros sistemas. </p>

<p>Tendo em vista isso se propõe o desenvolvimento de um sistema ao qual usuários autenticados e/ou não possam dispor de conteúdo estático e dinâmico através através de intranet, extranet, internet e/ou wap. Onde um administrador do sistema possa gerenciar usuários podendo cadastrar, excluir, definir e redefinir permissões de acesso e gerencia do sistema. Que exista a possibilidade de gerenciar templates, sites, paginas estáticas e dinâmicas para web e wap, fontes de dados e tabelas podendo adicionar, editar, copiar e excluir os mesmos. O sistema também deve permitir que o conteúdo possa ser disponibilizado a outras aplicações por intermédio de web services, permitindo uma fácil integração a sistemas que necessitem desses dados.</p>

<p>NOTE: If there is a specific feature you want added or changed, please let me know  here. </p>

<p>Update 1/13/2009: DemoI finally have a demo of the site up and running at http://sysadmin.union.rpi.edu/housing.  Play around with the system, let me know of bugs, issues, and missing features.  Google Maps support is still planned and is currently in development.  The application is planned to replace the current system no later than the end of this year. </p>

<p>Also, this project was developed as part of the RPI Center for Open Source Software (http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu/main/).  The Center wishes to extend a special thank you to Mr. Sean O&#39;Sullivan for providing the funding for this project as well as all other projects overseen by the center. </p>

<p>Update 11/23/2008: DelaysUnfortunately, this past week has been pretty horrible for me.  Several things went wrong but specifically my laptop stopped receiving power.  Not having a fully working laptop has set back development a little, but next week I should be getting a new one.  Currently the code that is in the repository represents the first Beta release of the program.  The SQL database template is stored as dbtemplate.sql </p>

<p>Update 11/10/2008: Browser SupportI&#39;ve gone through the browsers and determined which ones work well with this application as of this point.  Currently: </p>

<p>Fully works (all implemented functionality): </p>

<p>Google Chrome 0.3 Mozilla Firefox 3.0 Apple Safari 3.1.2 Almost Fully works (CSS problems or minor glitches): Opera 9.6 Partially Works (Javascript Problems Mostly): Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 (beta) Doesn&#39;t Work (You shouldn&#39;t even try right now): Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 (and earlier) </p>

<p>Update 11/7/2008: No betaSorry, no beta.  I decided to add a bunch more features first.  I&#39;m giving a presentation next Friday so you can absolutely expect a beta by then. </p>

<p>Update 11/3/2008Significant progress has been made towards making this application a reality.  I&#39;m currently working on the ability to search, delete, and map listings.  I expect to release the first beta of this application on Friday November 7 along with a demo site.  At this time I&#39;ll begin watching for suggestions via the Issues tracker of google code.  You can submit issues here. </p>

<p>Warning: This program is still extremely buggy in Internet Explorer, but full implemented functionality has been tested successfully in: </p>

<p>Firefox 3.0 Google Chrome 0.3 Apple Safari 3.1.2 Browsers that have full functionality are still buggy are: Opera 9.6 Internet Explorer 7 Internet Explorer 8 (beta) Browsers not currently supported are Internet Explorer 6 and earlier </p>

<p>The internet explorer family has issues with rendering the CSS properly, therefore, most functionality can be observed but it&#39;ll look pretty weird.  Also, IE6 (and earlier) cannot render transparent PNG&#39;s and has far less Javascript compatibility with other browsers and therefore cannot render some of the administration pages properly.  IE6 will minimally supported by this application, that is, unless you are an administrator, IE6 should work perfectly fine. </p>

<p>Note: Also, if you&#39;re particularly impatient, you can download the source code from SVN.  A sample database for the program is included in /trunk/dbtemplate.sql in which it defines a default form and creates an administrator with the account information: </p>

<p>username: administrator password: housing The program requires PHP 5.x and MySQL 4/5 to run.  Currently all authentication goes through MySQL but there are plans to support other login methods in the future.</p>

 title : The sneakernet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A cheap and secure last-mile Internet connectivity technology that provides basic email and web site access to any person anywhere, regardless of telecommunications infrastructure. The &#39;sneakernet&#39; is a digital communication network made up of portable storage devices such as USB thumb drives and camera memory cards, driven by software running on hand-held computing devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, portable game devices, digital cameras, and portable computers. The sneakernet can piggy-back data over existing trade and supply routes, bringing email and web access to any location that is habitable by humans.</p>

<p>Previous sneakernets have been simple point-to-point connections. Our sneakernet design uses a routing protocol that allows many-to-one connections between many end users and a single Internet access point. It allows messages to travel along the shortest possible transmission path through a cluster of interconnected couriers who overlap, and relay messages as they follow irregular and unpredictable paths. Software handles our routing protocol automatically so that users and couriers do not have to do any special route planning, they simply walk around normally and they &#39;gossip&#39; when they meet. The messages flowing over the sneakernet are encrypted, and couriers and eavesdroppers can&#39;t read them. A data relay server accesses email and web pages from the Internet and then dispatches them through the sneakernet to the specific end users who have requested them, and sends email for them by proxy.</p>

<p>Depending on the distances involved and the number and activity level of couriers, users may experience latency ranging from hours to days, weeks or months. Couriers could easily bring new email deliveries several times a day to users in densely populated areas like Haiti, whereas a village that lies hundreds of miles up a river in a rain forest in Brazil may only see one email delivery every week as traders visit the area with goods. If they live four trade stops up the river then it could take a month for an email to reach them, but their messages will find them automatically. Providing sneakernet Internet access will likely become a commercial industry in some areas. Even though the messages and web pages have to be carried by hand and may take days, and even though they may be passed off by relay between several different couriers along the way, the information will eventually arrive. It isn&#39;t quite the instant email experience that users would expect in New York City, but sending and receiving delayed email using a mobile phone is infinitely better than not being able to send and receive email at all.</p>
 title : The socialwebdesign Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SocialWebdesign definiert den Ausdruck „soziales Web“ ganz neu. Es geht nicht mehr nur darum Menschen zusammenzubringen, sondern auch darum, den Schwächeren zu helfen. Wer es im „realen“ Leben nicht einfach hat, wird es nicht zwangsläufig im Internet einfacher haben, nur weil die Barrieren kleiner und die Möglichkeiten grösser sind. </p>

<p>Genau da will SocialWebdesign ansetzen. Wir helfen den gemeinnützigen, nicht-profitorientierten, unabhängigen und finanzielle schwachen Organisationen und Gruppen (NGOs) ihren Weg im Internet zu finden und einfacher zu gestalten. Diese Hilfe kann sich auf verschiedene Arten ausdrücken: Unterstützung durch Werbung, Entwicklung einer Homepage, Vermittlung von Kontakten, etc. </p>

<p>SocialWebdesign soll dabei ebenfalls als NGO fungieren, die einzig von der freiwilligen Arbeit ihrer Mitglieder lebt. Nimmt man gewöhnliche NGOs als Beispiel, sieht man deutlich, dass es viele Menschen gibt, die aus Überzeugung ehrenamtliche Arbeiten und Tätigkeiten verrichten. Wieso sollte dieser Ansatz also nicht auch im Internet funktionieren?</p>

 summary : <p>SuperDeb CreatorSuperDeb Creator can create easy offline installers called &quot;SuperDebs&quot;. </p>

<p>Credits:(The following text was written by hacktolive) </p>

<p>In simple terms, &quot;SuperDeb&quot; technolgy was &quot;considered/invented&quot; by two persons, each making their own programs for a common problem: easy offline installation of software in Ubuntu. </p>

<p>Robertson Hamish created some code and made it available at http://code.google.com/p/superdeb His technology was called &quot;superdeb&quot; and consisted of self-extracting scripts using the .sdeb extension. Later, someone nicknamed &quot;hacktolive&quot; (me) also worked on his own offline installers. To be 100% honest, I am not sure if I was inspired by the superdebs of Robertson Hamish, but I think I saw his code and took some ideas from there. Later, we both chatted on the internet and shared ideas in a co-operation spirit. In March, 12th, 2010, Robertson Hamish donated the page http://code.google.com/p/superdeb to me (hacktolive), allowing me to &quot;unify&quot; both projects. Currently, there is only one SuperDeb project, with hacktolive as the lead maintainer, but open to input from anyone.</p>

<p>New!Google gadget version coming! This application will soon be available as a Google gadget which you can add to your iGoogle home page, giving you the best of both worlds. Hurray! </p>

<p>Try it first!Just follow this url http://goldenv.googlepages.com/tphp.html and try out the tool. Read the into below for more info. </p>

<p>IntroductionImagine you could have a browser home page, which is loaded faster than even the Google home page, provides recommendations based on your past searches, and provides powerful &quot;switches&quot; to route to the the world of internet with you in the back seat ? </p>

<p>If that appeals to you, this is a project designed for users like you. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed, but will simply be instead asking for more out of it. </p>

<p>A &quot;command based way to start your web journey&quot; is another way to think about this project. </p>

<p>Get it! (No installation needed)Just download the application html file and save it to a convenient location (in a temp folder or on the desktop if you just want to try this out). That&#39;s it! </p>

<p>Use itOpen your browser preferences and set this page as your home page. On a Macintosh, for example my file name is file:///Users/goldenv/Developer/projects/tphp.html which I set in Firefox&#39;s home page field (Firefox -&gt; Preferences) </p>

<p>Internet Explorer users: You must tell IE to run local scripts, which is necessary to run tphp, since it is implemented in javascript. And note that javascript does not have any local file system access. So this permission is safe. Your privacy or security is not lost. To enable this feature, just follow these steps (screenshot):  </p>

<p>In Tools -&gt; Internet Options - Advanced Tab
<br/>Scroll down to the Security options (one with the yellow lock)
<br/>Enable _&quot;Allow active content to run in files on My Computer&quot;_ option
<br/>Disable this option if you choose to not use tphpUsageYou can also just open it in the browser without setting it as a home page to first try it out. If you do not like the project, simply discard the html file! How cool is that ? </p>

<p>Once tphp.html is opened in a browser, try such queries and bingo! you are on the move. </p>

<br/>-g vishal shah
<br/>-y vishal shahSo, if you just type in a search term in &quot;the box&quot; it will run you to a google search. If you type in a query followed by &gt;&gt; as in california&gt;&gt; it will directly take you to google&#39;s first/top result using I&#39;m feeling lucky.   </p>

<p>And if you type in a URL, it will route you to that URL. These are the basics. No switches needed. But that&#39;s just the beginning and the fun part is yet to be demonstrated.  </p>

<p>Advanced queries have a switch as in &quot;-wp&quot; for searching wikipedia followed by the search query. And this concept can be expanded to things such as facebook profiles, ebay searches and more powerful custom searches (Complete TPHP command reference) </p>

A web page (pythons script) is in the works, that takes this html page as input and allows one to enter additional search engines and queries on the fly. The script will spit out the generated html file and all you have to do is replace it with the one on your computer. </p>

<p>Complete Command ReferenceComplete TPHP command reference </p>

<p>General ConceptThe general concept behind this project was to provide a simple command based interface to the web. Since there are multiple resources on the web, what if you can give a shortcut (aka switch) to many of them so that one can conveniently access them ? And this project was born to solve that problem. </p>

<p>RoadmapSoon, I will release a web based script to add/update your favorite sites and commands. So just stay tuned. </p>

<p>Privacy/SecurityNo data is ever transmitted from your system. There is a local &quot;cookie&quot; stored on your computer which is used by the recommendations feature. But it is local to your system and since tphp runs on your system only, it is never transmitted to anywhere on the internet or even other computers in your network. </p>

<p>In other words, tphp is an extremely safe, secure and privacy-compliant application. The only complaint you might have is for Internet Explorer which requires enabling the &quot;Allow active content to run in files on My Computer&quot; option. </p>

<p>Uninstall/RemoveJust remove the tphp.html file downloaded. Clear your browser cookies to remove stored recommendations. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>If you used Internet Explorer you might want to disable back the &quot;Allow active content to run in files on My Computer&quot; option. Refer to the &quot;Activate&quot; section above on this page to locate the option.  </p>

<p>Thanks for using TPHP! </p>

<p>Albatross is a proxy server which pulls programs from your TiVo and re-streams them to the client at a lower bit-rate so that it can be viewed in real-time over bandwidth-challenged network connections, such as 802.11b or the internet. It does this by using VideoLAN Client and a patched version of vstream-client to re-encode the video in real-time and stream it to the client as Flash Video. TyStreamer has been tested on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), but assumed to work on Linux, Windows or any platform supported by PHP and VLC.</p>

 summary : <p>Veoh-ProxyNote: Ninjavideo is currently not workingNinjaVideo changed their server layout and now employ encryption. I already cracked and reimplemented it but won&#39;t have time to implement their new storage host for videos until next year. </p>

<p>DescriptionVeoh-Proxy, a local Web Server that streams high quality content from Veoh - the originally uploaded version, not the FLV-compressed version with low quality. </p>

<p>It also replaces the NinjaVideo helper software with less restrictions than the original program (No referral checking, etc.).  </p>

<p>So now, any online video website could use this helper (or a derrivate work) to supply viewers with high quality video content hosted on Veoh. </p>

<p>The program is mainly developed for the great XBMC XBox Media Center, but should run on any platform that knows how to deal with python files. Just install python for your operating system and start the default.py file. </p>

<p>It can stream content from the following websites: </p>

<p>Veoh Messagefromme / Streamplug Ninjavideo </p>

<p>Technical StuffIf you like a download manager, you can use resuming and multipart downloading with it. With this, you should be able to grab the veoh videos with full speed. I was able to download at 20Mbyte/s from a university server. </p>

<p>It currently supports Videos from Veoh, Ninjavideo and Streamplug (messagefromme.com). It supports HTTP proxies. It should use the proxy settings of your operating system. If it does not, simply edit the default.py file and change the PROXY line. </p>

<p>UsageTo start the program, you need to install Python first. Then you can probably just double-click the default.py fine and a console should show up. If this doesn&#39;t work, open up a command window, change to the directory you unzipped the files to using &#39;CD \path\to\files&#39; on windows. Now tell python to open that file. Type: </p>

<p>\path\you\installed\python\to\python.exe default.py </p>

<p>for example </p>

<p>C:\python25\python.exe default.py </p>

<p>Now it should output some stuff and run in the console. </p>

<p>To try the program, please search for Veoh videos on their Website. If you click on any of the results, you will get to a URL like:  http://www.veoh.com/videos/v280192es88wEr4?searchId=3295803849254710272&amp;rank=1 Take the cryptic part starting with the letter &quot;v&quot; and append it to the local webserver URL:  http://127.0.0.1:64653/v280192es88wEr4. (The port has been changed in version 1.3. Used to be 64652.) You can just type it in your browser and it should download or show the file. Or you can pass the URL directly to your favourite media player. </p>

<p>The NinjaVideo website should run without any problems. If the program doesn&#39;t show any errors and videos don&#39;t work, you should check your video player settings or try downloading the video file instead. </p>

<p>To download messagefromme videos, you need to have a look into the source code of the website showing the video (Ctrl-U in Firefox). Search (Ctrl-F) for &quot;.ogm&quot; without the quotes and you should see an embedded video URL. Now you need to encode that url in base64, maybe using this online base64 encoder. Then just attach /streamplug/ + the base64 string to the url, for example if the real URL is: http://diffuser4.messagefromme.com:80/myvideoregistry/video_12402.ogm, the base64-encoded string is: aHR0cDovL2RpZmZ1c2VyNC5tZXNzYWdlZnJvbW1lLmNvbTo4MC9teXZpZGVvcmVnaXN0cnkvdmlkZW9fMTI0MDIub2dt </p>

<p>and the resulting download/stream URL is: http://0.0.0.0:64653/streamplug/aHR0cDovL2RpZmZ1c2VyNC5tZXNzYWdlZnJvbW1lLmNvbTo4MC9teXZpZGVvcmVnaXN0cnkvdmlkZW9fMTI0MDIub2dt </p>

<p>Sorry for the base64 thing. I developed Veoh-Proxy for XBMC where this makes at least some sense.</p>

 summary : <p>This script subscribes to a podcast feed using the Windows common feed list. It can be used to subscribe to a podcast from Firefox and have it show up in Windows Media Player and other media players. Unlike other podcatchers, the program doesn&#39;t need to keep running in the background because downloads are handled the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (also used by Windows Update), which only runs when there is little network activity. </p>

<p>Requires Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Vista. Not tested on Windows XP. </p>

<p>InstructionsHow to subscribe to podcasts directly from Firefox: </p>

<p>Download the two files here and save them in a convenient location. In Firefox, go to a podcast page, such as this one. In the drop-down menu, choose Other Application and browse to CommonFeedList.cmd. (You will need to type *.* to show all files). Click subscribe. By default, podcasts are downloaded once a day. Downloaded episodes will automatically show up in &quot;My Music\Podcasts&quot; and Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>What&#39;s V.U.G ?V.U.G stands for Virtual Universe Generator. It&#39;s an open source project started and developped by four students of Sherbrooke&#39;s University. The primary goal of this project was to provide a &quot;as friendly as possible &quot; user interface that would allow the creation of a virtual world driven by basic physics laws in which the user would be able to : </p>

<p>Create and modify the environnement (physic laws, objects, ...). Add static and dynamic objects (before the simulation or in real-time). Move inside the world and interract in real-time with it. </p>

<p>In order to achieve such a thing, we&#39;ve based our works on already existing technology, interfacing them so it could ultimatly be easily modified to fit, change or remove some parts or modules. </p>

<p>At this day, those technologies are directly linked to the core of the application : </p>

<p>OGRE 3D Open Dynamic Engine (ODE) Qt -- Trolltech The application is 100% C++ code and as a strong object oriented design. </p>

<p>Recently, V.U.G was used in study regarding simulation of environnements of robotic assistance (tele-nursing) using the Nintendo wiimote as a starter for intuitive piloting of the robot arms. Check VUG-SEAR sub-project for more info about this. </p>

<p>New VUG-SEAR release is now integrated into VUGVUG-SEAR was an idea proposed by Bessam Abdulrazak, in which he would like to use the vug-simulator to simulate en environnement of robotic assistance. The idea was well received and then some more ideas came, concerning the use of intuitive controller to help the remote piloting of a robot. The API design was then reviewed and modified to provide and easy to use programmable interface that would manage the communications between the actions of the pilot with it&#39;s controller to the simulated robot. So, we&#39;ve decided with enthusiast to use the Nintendo Wiimote as our intuitive controller to pilot the robot, but the ultimate goal of this interface is to use it in a real robot manipulation. </p>

<p>As of today, we managed to create some nice scenes and simulations that can be loaded in the vug-simulator. We&#39;ve worked hard on implementing a driver and a big configuration tool for the Nintendo Wiimote. We tried to keep it as user friendly as possible during the developpement. </p>

<p>Technologies used in this project : </p>

<p>Ogre3D Graphics Engine (ogre3d.org) ODE Physics Engine (ode.org) QT Framework (trolltech.com) Encapsulation of Wiiuse Wiimote library </p>

<p>The main features we&#39;ve implemented in this project : </p>

<p>Motion detection and analysis. 3D controllable objects with physics (Robot Arm). 3D Vision experimentation (based on Johnny Chung Lee&#39;s work). Actions associated to the wiimote commands are configurable. Multiple configurations of the wiimote + Dynamic navigation through one another. </p>

 title : The wealthmanagement Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>We’re all in this game to make money. Am I right? I mean, some of you might read this blog because you find it interesting even if you don’t make money on the net, and that’s fine. But truth be told, this blog exists to serve those of you who are trying to make money online. Even myself, for whom this blog is only a side hobby to compliment my already successful career, it’s still all about the money.  </p>

<p>Because of that obvious fact, I thought it would be pertinent to take a second to write something a bit out of the ordinary. Instead of discussing code, or black-hat techniques, or get rich quick schemes, let’s talk about something simple and eschew regular discussion of internet and technology all together: Let’s talk about wealth. </p>

<p>The concept of wealth applies to all of us, whether we are considered ‘wealthy’ or not, and regardless of where and how we accumulated said wealth. Personally, the overwhelming majority of my wealth has been made in the real estate industry, not the Internet. Surprised? You shouldn’t be. A wise man diversifies. And for me, the Internet has been one of my ways of diversifying. </p>

<p>Here’s the thing: Becoming wealthy ain’t complicated. Determining the air-speed velocity of African Swallow is complicated. That sort of thing involves all sorts of mathematics and calculation. Becoming wealthy, however, requires little more then a solid knowledge of the basics: addition &amp; subtraction.  </p>

<p>Granted, I am oversimplifying for the sake of argument. One must always have that tipping point idea before they can begin to start adding to their wealth instead of constantly subtracting. But bare with me here. Given the claim that the accumulation of wealth requires little more then the ability to do simple math, the reason more people aren’t wealthy is simple: they don’t know when to add, and they don’t know when to subtract. </p>

<p>The secret to wealth is this: Spend less than you earn.   </p>

<p>The more you earn and the less you spend, the richer you become. </p>

<p>This sounds like basic common sense right? If I have two apples and I give Suzy one of them, then I’ve only got one apple left for myself. So why don’t we have more wealthy people? Why is the Canadian national savings rate so low? Well, it’s for the same reason that last years gross personal expenditure on consumer goods topped 880 billion with a gross personal income of 782 billion. </p>

<p>It’s because people don’t actually want to be wealthy. People want to appear wealthy. People want to make their friends and neighbors jealous. People want to live beyond their means.  </p>

<p>It’s this overwhelming need to appear rich that keeps people from actually becoming rich. This is one of the top reasons why people aren’t wealthier. They get caught in this crazy cycle of spending and consuming, they fall for the marketing, buy the latest trends, need the newest cell phone, and guess what?? I bet those people have no clue of what their net worth really is, or even how to calculate it. These are people who will never become wealthy. </p>

<p>Another reason, especially applicable for all you internet marketers out there, is the idea of being able to get rich quick. The idea of getting in, scraping major cash, and getting out is a massive communal pipedream shared by millions of people. It just doesn’t happen often enough to base a business on it. If you were to pitch me a business plan that hinges on winning the lottery, or a perfect hand in a game of cards, I’d be tempted to smack you in the face. Why? Because you need to wake up to the fact that it ain’t gonna happen. I haven’t crunched the statistics, but I feel confident in saying that you stand a better chance of getting struck by lighting on a clear cloudless day then you do becoming rich quickly. </p>

<p>You can’t bank on luck, and you can’t expect luck to pay the bills. Saving is the only surefire way to become rich. But it ain’t that glamorous is it? Today’s internet entrepreneur who has had a taste of success doesn’t want to save, he wants to spend more to make more; he wants to gamble. </p>

<p>Eventually, this will bite him in the ass. You see, the beauty of saving is that it doesn’t matter what you do with your money as long as you don’t spend it.  Further, the beauty of saving is that every month, the more you save, the richer youbecome. It’s a system of accumulating wealth that is literally free from danger. It’s foolproof. </p>

<p>To truly become wealthy, you must develop a strong balance between saving your money, and living a quality of lifestyle that works for you. Once you’ve developed that healthy habit and have stopped consuming products that you don’t need, well, you’ll be way ahead of the majority of the population and at that point you’ll understand what wealth truly is. </p>

<p>Wealth isn’t your car, your clothes or your phone. Wealth isn’t how you spend your money; it’s how you save it that counts.</p>

<p>It is based on a cut-down version of the M6800 chip, and a reduced instruction set. The simulator assembles and simulates execution of the users code on a GUI</p>
 title : The webcite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Description“WebCite”, is a citation tool that would be helpful in many ways to users on the internet who would like to store References for later use. In the way, the tool helps to store reference/citation information such as title of the website, the author, date retrieved, and the URL of a particular webpage. This information could then be copied to a simple text editor such as Notepad or a complex word processor such as Word 2007. </p>

<p>WebCite is implemented as a browser extension.The user would be able to access WebCite from View-&gt;Explorer Bar-&gt;WebCite. The user interface is an Explorer bar implementation which has the following fields: Author, Name of Webpage, Name of Website, Date created, Date accessed, URL of the webpage. It would also have a copy button. </p>

<p>Accessing WebCite </p>

<p>The User Interface </p>

<p>Operation DetailsOnce some text is selected in Internet Explorer, the user can see information of the webpage filled in the fields of the Explorer Bar. The user can edit the fields in case of missing information. He then clicks the copy button. This will create our own “text+reference” object that will be stored on the Windows Clipboard.  </p>

<p>From this point forward, any application can use the “text+reference” object. We implement an extension to Microsoft Word 2007 so that when the user pastes a “text+reference” object, a references page is automatically generated in the currently opened document. Also this reference information would be stored in Word 2007&#39;s Source Manager. </p>

 title : The wwwsqldesigner Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WWW SQL Designer allows users to create database designs, which can be saved/loaded and exported to SQL scripts. Various databases and languages are supported. Ability to import existing database design. </p>

<p>AboutHi and welcome to WWW SQL Designer! This tool allows you to draw and create database schemas (E-R diagrams) directly in browser, without the need for any external programs (flash). You only need JavaScript enabled. The Designer works perfectly in Mozillas (Firefox, Seamonkey), Internet Explorers (6, 7, 8), Safari and Operas. Konqueror works, but the experience is limited. </p>

<p>Many database features are supported, such as keys, foreign key constraints, comments and indexes. You can either save your design (for further loading &amp; modifications), print it or export as SQL script. It is possible to retrieve (import) schema from existing database. </p>

<p>WWW SQL Designer was created by Ondrej Zara and is built atop the oz.js JavaScript module. It is distributed under New BSD license. </p>

<p>If you wish to support this project,  at PayPal! </p>

<p>NewsNew releaseVersion 2.4 was released on 5.11.2009. Several outstanding issues were fixed and new locales added. </p>

<p>ReleaseVersion 2.3.3 was released on 28.7.2009. This long-awaited release includes numerous fixes, compatibility improvements, new locales, backends and DB datatypes. </p>

<p>ReleaseVersion 2.3.2 was released on 8.1.2009. Apart from some traditional bugfixes and locales, a new functionality is introduced - the ability to mark foregin keys between existing table fields! </p>

 title : The babudb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>babudb is an embedded database library providing management of persistent key-value indices without the overhead and complexity of similar approaches such as BerkeleyDB. Its key features: </p>

<p>Full access and control over the database log (necessary to implement replication) Exports set of configurable key-value indices. LSM-tree indices (immutable base + overlays) enables implementation of highly-compressed and full-text indices. </p>

<p>babudb is implemented as two independent and incompatible Java and C++ (win32/Linux) versions. </p>

<p>Much of the simplicity and efficiency of the babudb design comes from the use of small mutable overlay-trees (also known as LSM-trees) layered on a larger immutable memory-mapped on-disk index, an architecture that was made popular by Google&#39;s BigTable. </p>

<p>babudb is used as the database engine in the replicated metadata server of the XtreemFS file system. </p>

 title : The cxpdo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This class extends the PDO object to provide DB abstraction - a simple way to query different types of databases without needing to change your code. </p>

<p>PDO: </p>

<p>PDO provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that, regardless of which database you&#39;re using, you use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data. PDO does not provide a database  abstraction; it doesn&#39;t rewrite SQL or emulate missing features. You should use a full-blown abstraction layer if you need that facility. - http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php </p>

<p>However PDO does not cover DB query-abstraction - for that you have to use some huge class like ADOdb or PEAR:DB. Which of course will slow your site to a crawl if you are using shared hosting. </p>

<p>This class fills this gap and provides DB query-abstraction for common functions like SELECT, REPLACE, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries. The actual PDO object is not changed in anyway - each of these functions still returns a PDO Statement Object. </p>

<p>The total package size is only 18kb! And that is with LOTS of comments explaining the code! It is the missing link for people who love the DATA abstraction PDO provides but also need QUERY abstraction. </p>

<p>Currently it only works on SQLite2-3 and MySQL. However because it is built for the SQL langauge - it will be supper simple to add PostgreSQL or MSSQL support as well (copy mysql class and change 3-5 functions). I just don&#39;t have a copy of either DB up and running to test it.</p>
 title : The daswriteback Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DAS2 writeback server implementationThe aim of this project is to implement Writeback functionality, that would enable biological data submission via DAS protocol. It should extend read-only DAS model by adding possibilities to write data back to the server. As a result, the client-side interactivity of the DAS services would be improved. </p>

<p>Why?Nowadays, the enormous amounts of biological data are available: genomes of many organisms, protein sequences and their 3D structures, microarray data, biochemical networks within the cell etc. Therefore information systems providing facilities to store, analyze and display this data have become an important issue. Data integration is another question that arises from the fact that biological information is not provided by a centralized database, but by diverse data sources, that range from large scale databases like EMBL and UniProt to small databases hosted by biological laboratories. Therefore, it is necessary to provide services for bringing together data from diverse storages, while they can continue to facilitate local warehousing, analyzing, and organizing of information.    </p>

<p>To tackle these issues the concept of DAS was introduced.  </p>

<p>What is DAS?The Distributed Annotation System(DAS) is a data exchange protocol, that is specially designed for bringing together data from diverse decentralized biological databases. The  data distribution is performed by DAS servers and is separated from vizualisation, performed by DAS clients  A good example of such client is Ensembl genome browser. However, Ensembl is not only a client, but a complete all-in-one DAS system. It serves both as a DAS server (Ensembl reference sequence and annotation servers) and a DAS client. For more information about usage of DAS in Ensembl, please see.... </p>

<p>For more information about DAS, please refer to the BioDAS web-page, and the article &quot;The distributed annotation system&quot; written by Allen Day, Sean Eddy, Robin Dowell, Rodney Jokerst and Lincoln Stein in 2001.    </p>

<p>What is DAS writeback?It is an extension of DAS, that enables to write data back to the server via standard XML document. The writeback functionality was described in the new version of DAS protocol, in the DAS 2.0 protocol, that was published on the BioDAS web-page. Technically, the idea of writeback is in use of a specially designed XML file, named as a writeback document. This document contains the submitted data and instructions to the server (insert, modify or delete the data). The document is POSTed to an URI, where it is recognized and passed to the server. Data is submitted via web-interface, and stored in the database.   </p>

<p>The idea of the writeback implementation is to provide a wiki-like service, where everybody can make modifications and see history of changes. This feature is supposed to be primarily used by DAS server administrators. Further, it can be included into DAS clients browsers, for example into Ensembl genome browser. However, writeback should not be considered only as a program for data submission, but rather as a ground for further development of applications that can submit data via DAS protocol. </p>

<p>ImplementationThe writeback implementation is based on the concept of client-server architecture and basically consists of three layers: user interface, database, and functional logic between the first two. </p>

<p>Architecture </p>

<p>ClientClient-side is represented by the web-based user interface, implemented using Java Server Pages (JSP) technology, and accessed by user through a standard web-browser. It includes feature submission form, list of currently available features, and history of modifications. see more </p>

<p>Functional logicImplements functionality for binding together Client and Database tiers. Essentially, it provides access to the database objects, performs parsing of the XML writeback document, and sends parsed data to the database. It consists of a set of Java Servlets running on the Apache Tomcat application server. </p>

<p>DatabaseDatabase tier is responsible for data serialization, that means storing data in the database. In this project was used MySQL database. see more </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>Open ID sign-inAn important feature of the writeback implementation is an OpenID user-login.  </p>

<p>OpenID is a free and decentralized single sign-on system https://www.myopenid.com/. It enables simple and reliable user-login. The idea of OpenID is that once created, the OpenID identifier can be used anywhere. It will suit for logging into many websites, the only requirement is that these web-sites should implement OpenID login system.  </p>

<p>The writeback documentThe writeback document is in XML format. All of the DAS2 writeback elements are in the standard DAS2 namespace.  </p>

<p>Here is an example of the writeback document, where a single feature is being modified:  </p>

 title : The database-analytics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of this project is to develop a suitable database management system that is capable of efficiently handling heavy query processing and analytics.   </p>

<p>Rather than building an entire system from scratch, the project will be based on a stable existing open source database.  The current target is postgresql, mainly because it already provides many of the desired features.  It will be retrofitted in a way that favors reads over transactions, however transaction processing still shouldn&#39;t be a major pitfall. </p>

<p>The current objective is performance for operations that would otherwise run long times - to allow applications to perform more analysis and complex querying than with traditional databases; and, improve on the existing features of postgre.  An additional feature is to provide for the ability to use the database for xml purposes, in a way that is transparent to the user; ie. they can use xquery and dump data as one would expect with a fully supported xml database.</p>

 title : The database-auditing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Banking and marketing organizations require regular monitoring of customer information and transactional data to protect privacy and integrity of data. This is easily done using automated database monitoring software that provides a wide range of benefits to the organization. The most useful aspect of using these tools is the performance benefits derived from them. Using them allows enterprise resources to be used optimally to sustain or improve overall performance.  </p>

<p>Database auditing solutions also act as an early warning to administrators to take the necessary preventive measures required. They provide regular health checkups and audits to keep online businesses running without any breaks and also integrate well with existing systems, so that risk associated with integration and data recovery procedures is reduced. A tool that reduces overall overhead cost will surely benefit the organization by improving ROI at the long run.</p>

 summary : <p>Hi all! </p>

<p>This database tool is suppose to perform all kind of SQL operation on your databse file (with RDMS concept), you do not have to wory about its perfomence and productivity it will do all kind of RDBMS operation automatically for you just you have to select what do you want to do.  
<br/>API of this tool will be developed on xml and python based grphics accelator too so that developer do not need to wory about the API&#39;s i will try to make it compatible with every browser and office tools like ms-excel etc so you dont have to type your table content into this tool because you can directly import that file into this database tool. 
<br/>Network implementation of this tool still to be desigined and i hope that it will be compatible for every kind of network application. 
<br/>Security implementaion of this database tool will be very high because of Python library support. 
<br/>Modularity of this tool is not to concern at this time because we are developing this tool  on windows so will take care of this part after we once done with the development work.

 title : The depunit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DepUnit is designed with the belief that in any complicated system the unit tests build upon one another.  In many unit test frame works there is a considerable amount of effort put into allowing the tester to setup and tear down the environment so that the tests can be performed.  We believe that this setup and tear down procedure should be a unit test as well.  For example a connection needs to be made to the database before unit tests can be performed on the data.  The connection process should be a unit test and the other tests depend on it to succeed. </p>

<p>With this in mind DepUnit lets you create what we call hard and soft dependencies between tests.  DepUnit also allows for clean up tests that perform the tear down of other frameworks. </p>

<p>DepUnit is also designed with the idea that data is at the heart of all unit tests.  Unit tests usually test a system with some given set of data.  DepUnit provides easy mechanisms for passing data into unit tests and passing data from one test to another.  DepUnit also provides an easy way to run the same tests multiple times with different data. </p>

 title : The dmigrate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DMigrate is a simple tool which lets you migrate Django databases easily. With DMigrate: </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to use any SQL. You don&#39;t need to learn any command for changing database structure. You can do whatever transformations you like. You can do the migration as many times as you like, until you get it right, without fear of data loss. </p>

<p>There&#39;s one drawback: DMigrate is not as efficient as other migration tools, which means that it&#39;s probably suitable only for small to medium sites. </p>

<p>The idea is simple: DMigrate writes for you a script which takes all the data from the current database and copies it to a newly created database. You then edit the script to make any transformations you like on your data, and then run the script. If you&#39;re not satisfied with the result, you re-edit the script, and run it again. When you are satisfied, make your website use your newly created database. That&#39;s all! </p>

<p>DMigrate can also be used to migrate your data from one database engine to another. </p>

<p>April, 2008: </p>

<p>Download AvailableA download has been made available with hopes to get more contributors.  It should only be used for testing purposes, as it is not stable enough for daily use.  The username for the demo is &quot;admin&quot;.  Any password will work, as it will set up a new one upon logging in..   </p>

<p>The trial will work best on a Windows platform, as some file and directory creation permission issues still need to be worked out with OSX, Solaris and Linux.  If you&#39;d like to try it anyways, run with the following command: </p>

<p>java -jar DBClient.jar --debugYou may have to create some folders, such as &quot;/Application and Development/admin&quot; until I can work out the cross-platform folder handling. </p>

<p>Developers / Subversion Download AvailableA read-only working copy is available anonymously over HTTP through Google Code SVN.  Click her for more details.  To check it out issue the follow command, or add the appropriate URL to your IDE such as NetBeans or Eclipse. </p>

<p>svn checkout http://documentdatabase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ documentdatabase-read-onlyYou may also obtain the NetBeans source by direct download by clicking &quot;Downloads&quot; above, or by clicking here. </p>

<p>Naturally, you&#39;ll notice huge code and functionality differences between the demo and the source.  Basic functionality has been restored in Netbeans, but the interface needs to be re-built with the Netbeans (or Eclipse) IDE for standardization, and many of the &quot;Demo&quot; features only work with a clean build of a &quot;jar&quot;.  This is due to the &quot;zip file&quot; handling in much of the &quot;first run&quot; code. </p>

<p>A hurdle I&#39;ve hit is the locale settings, and image loading, which prior to Netbeans used their own custom Classes.  I&#39;m working now to follow IDE standards for a more contributor-friendly approach, but will take some time before its complete. </p>

<p>I must stress the importance that both the executable (to the right) and the source (in the downloads section) can change considerably over the next few months.  No requests or bug fix requests should be made at this time... If you are a Java developer and would like to contribute, please contact me on how to get involved! </p>

<p>-Tres </p>

<p>As of January, 2008, the project has been converted to a Netbeans project, but this has broken several features, so downloads are on hold. </p>

<p>What to expect is a multi-lingual and cross-platform interface for organizing and assigning Procedures, Policies, Forms, Manuals, Portable Documents, Presentations, Worksheets, etc.  The main purpose is to manage outdated documents by assigning them to others that use the application. </p>

<p>It also helps organize, share, search, helping production and work flow for small and medium sized businesses, or within a department of a larger business. </p>

<p>Source is written for Java 5, but some features may require Java 6. </p>

<p>Operating Systems tested are OSX, Ubuntu, Windows.  Macros only currently work for Microsoft Office, and have not been developed for OpenOffice.org yet. </p>

<p>ChangelogUpdate 01/11/2008:  First success with Netbeans, finally fixed deadlocks.  Still need to fix login, and document scanning before an early alpha can be released.  Once a usable alpha is up, there will be a new interface built, new image handling, new language handling, new theme handling, and new document scanning. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Update 01/29/2008:  Downloads added, and some major netbeans milestones surpassed.  Source code still not ready for the public, but I&#39;ve offered it for any help or feedback.  First time working with SVN, but should have code on version control shortly.  You&#39;ll notice the executable is to the right.  I only recommend using this for evaluation purposes.  It is not stable enough for daily use. </p>

<p>Update 01/01/2008:  The project has been packaged for Netbeans 6.0, but still needs a lot of changes before the first release.  If possible, we&#39;ll be implementing the Scriptom + Groovy language for our Office automation and rebuild our GUI components with the IDE.  There after, we&#39;ll rewrite some of the threading modules, and be ready for a first alpha.  Sorry for the delays! </p>

<p>-Tres </p>

<p>What&#39;s Taking So long? </p>

<p>Update 10/01/2007:  After reviewing other open source projects, there&#39;s some long-awaited changes that need be made to comply with Java packaging, ant building, versioning, and the ability to easily work with and IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse.  This will widen the ability for others to contribute, as well as ease the installation process for legacy platforms. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the application has been written entirely with a text editor, so a lot of planning is in store. </p>

<p>-Tres </p>

<p>DetailsEssentially, a company has a lot of documentation that should expire and be reviewed.  This provides that functionality, with a few other neat things, such as searching, etc. </p>

<p>Supports .doc, .docx, .xls, .xml, .vsd, .pdf, and some others.  Some features rely on JDK 6.0, but code will compile under 5.0. </p>

<p>Aside from automation, .odt&#39;s, etc will work if OpenOffice is installed (Java 6 will open the document with its default application with the Desktop.getDesktop().open(&quot;C:\myfile&quot;); class, it just won&#39;t update any fields in the document yet. </p>

<p>Implementing an &quot;internal&quot; HSQL (Hypsersonic SQL) database, the server portion is relatively portable, and completely platform independent.  The database should eventually reside on its own dedicated server of course... development is actually performed with the database residing on an ancient IBM AS/400, running a packaged JRE 1.2 build of HSQL. </p>

<p>Stand-alone server scripts are included for Windows, Linux and AS/400 QSH.  May work for others.  Some modification may be needed. </p>

<p>How do I get it?Downloads are currently disabled until the first alpha is released.  If you&#39;d like to try it, please email an author! </p>

<p>Click downloads at the top or side of the page. </p>

<p>UpdatesKeep checking back, as the interface and codebase are undergoing some redesign. </p>

<p>For a sample of the latest build, feel free to email the project author.  No date for an actual release, but java developers are needed! </p>

 title : The duckiebank Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Sisters Of Passion Dev team has taken over development of Duckiebank! </p>

<p>Special thanks to Evil Duck for his support on our endeavor! </p>

<p>Version 2.5 has now been released! </p>

<p>To learn more about our guild - visit our guild website at http://www.sistersofpassion.org or visit us in-game on sentinels! </p>

<p>Description: </p>

<p>The DuckieBank is a 100% in-game, and fully automatic, guildbank that enables a guild to share a read-only view of its guildbanks&#39; contents with all guildies. All members of the guild (with DuckieBank installed) will be able to see the guildbank as a read-only version. DuckieBank also implements an easy-to-use request-system where guildies can request items from the banks without having to use the in-game mail-system or chat. Simply click the item you want, type an optional note, and press &quot;Send request&quot;. The banker will receive your request whenever he logs on. There is no need for the banker to be online for a guildie to be able to view or update that banker&#39;s contents, or to request items from it. This is all automatic, and handled by the addon. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>- No setup for guildies or bankers - The GM (or trusted officers) controls who gets to be banker(s). It&#39;s not possible to control this for any user. This is done by assigning the title &quot;Banker&quot; to the designated bankers or assingning bankers in the officer&#39;s note. (Requires relog if the banker is online when the promotion is made) - Automatic in-game update of bank contents - Item request-system - Simple cost-system that enables you to charge gold, DKP, etc, for items if you want. DuckieBank can insert vendor buy/sell prices if the banker has Auctioneer installed. No need for Auctioneer for guildies in any case. - Banker-specific notes for info to guildies. Typical use may be banker-specific rules or names of characters the banker can be reached when the banker-character is not online. - Multiple guilds per account - Multiple bankers per guild - Notifies all users in the guild about availability of a new version if a user in the guild has upgraded the addon - Can include any (or all of) the banker-character&#39;s bags - Minimap icon that will fit any-shaped minimaps for heavily modified interfaces. </p>

<p>The bank contents: </p>

<p>The contents of each banker will be spread througout the guild in a steady pace. When a banker updates its data (presses the &quot;Send&quot; button), its data will be transmitted to all other DuckieBanks that are online at that specific time. The banker can now log off, as there at this time are others with the new data. When another guildie logs on, one of the DuckieBanks with the fresh data will eventually retransmit the new data. This means that the update of banker data is not instant. So when you have a fresh install, it may take some time before your addon receives banker data. The most important factor in the update delay is the amount of DuckieBank addons that are installed in your guild, and the more addons you have online, the quicker the update. </p>

<p>When your addon has received data for a banker once, each following update will be much quicker as your addon now knows about the banker and will regularly request updates. As World of Warcraft servers are not very fond of addons spamming channels with large amounts of data, mechanisms has been built in to prevent any transmissions unless there actually is newer data available. </p>

<p>The request-system: </p>

<p>First of all, the request-system is under total control of each banker. It&#39;s only requests, and each banker may handle that as he sees fit - be it sending an item by mail, deleting the request without sending anything, send a mail to the requester with a question, or just leave the request there to be handled the next time he logs on. The implemented request-system works much like a post-system, where any guildie can send a request for one or more items. By left-clicking on an item, that item will be set up in the request-box in the main DuckieBank interface. Subsequent left-clicks on the same item increases the number of items requested, while shift-left-click decreases the number. This means that it is possible to request more items than the bank have of a specific item. The banker can then chose to leave those requests until the bank has the requested number of items. </p>

<p>To avoid request-spamming by guildies, it is strongly advisable to set up some guild-rules about this. The banker-notes can function as an ideal place to put those rules or guidelines. </p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<p>DuckieBank comes bundled with the addon DuckNet. This addon is needed to run the data network. Think of it as a converter between WoW chat channels and a data network, if you will. </p>

<p>Installation: </p>

<p>Extract the folders in the archive to the Interface\AddOns\ location. Log in to you account and make sure both DuckieBank and DuckNet is enabled for the characters that is to use the addon. That is all. </p>

<p>If you are the GM or a trusted officer of your guild and want to start using DuckieBank, you must assign the banker-job to one or more characters. Use one of the following methods to enable your bankers: 1. Make a new guild-rank called &quot;Banker&quot; and assign that to the characters that is to function as guild banks. This new rank does not need any privileges at all. Even though being allowed to chat will come in handy for a banker. 2. Assign bankers by use of officer&#39;s notes. In the officer&#39;s note of a banker, type &quot;#DB:B&quot; anywhere. For this to work, the banker must have permission to read the officer&#39;s notes. Write-permission is not needed. </p>

<p>With this done, those characters&#39; bank (and optionally their bags) will be made public read-only to any other member of the guild with the DuckieBank addon installed. </p>

<p>Being a dedicated banker: </p>

<p>If you want to really dedicate yorself to the banker role, you can ask your GM or a trusted officer to assign one or more of your characters to be &quot;Monitors&quot;. These characters do not have banker clearance, but will be able to see if a request has been placed and to which banker. The Monitor will not be able to see who made the request or what was requested - only which banker it is meant for. This feature is primarely meant for other characters played by the banker user so they can see if there are placed requests for them while they are online on other characters. The feature is enabled by typing &quot;#DB:M&quot; in the officer&#39;s note. The Monitor will in that case need access to read the officer&#39;s note. Assigned Monitor will be able to see, in the minimap-button tooltip, a count of requests made for bankers since the last time a character were logged off on the same account. Please note that the &quot;#DB:M&quot; and &quot;#DB:B&quot; settings are mutually exclusive. They can not be used together on the same character. </p>

<p>Banker specific option: </p>

<p>There are several banker-specific option available in the options-window from the banker interface. </p>

<p>How to test with your guild: </p>

<p>1. Install DuckieBank on at least two accounts in the same guild. 2. Make one of them banker as explained in Installation. (Requires relog of the banker character if it is online when promoted to banker) 3. Go to a major city with the banker character and open its bank. Make sure there are items in the bank. 4. Open DuckieBank (minimap icon) and press Send. A few seconds later the message &quot;Sending...&quot; will appear. When transmission is done, the non-banker character will get a message about received banker data. </p>

<p>How to quickly test the automatic update: </p>

<p>1. Make a change in the banker-character&#39;s bank. Do not press Send. 2. Log the non-banker character off and then back on. 3. Wait 30-40 seconds. </p>

<p>These steps requires that you have done the first steps so that the non-banker character&#39;s addon previously has seen the banker. </p>

<p>Issues and compatibilities: </p>

<p>Even though support for bag-modifying addons have been strengthened a lot as of DuckieBank v2.40, you just never know with which addon the problem will arise again. If DuckieBank will not include your WoW-bank in its contents, try switching off any bag modifier you may have and go visit your WoW-bank again. This is either way only a potential problem for banker characters. Other characters on the same account will not have this problem.</p>
 title : The dwc-feed-builder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Current ReleaseBeta 0.2 </p>

<p>OverviewThe DarwinCore Feed Builder (DFB) is developed at the University of California at Berkeley. It generates and then syndicates RSS and Atom web feeds that describe changes in DwC records served by individual TAPIR resources.  </p>

<p>The primary use case this system addresses is the syndication of DwC record changes (insert, update, delete operations). Applications will be able to subscribe to this feed to monitor changes in DwC records served by a resource.  </p>

<p>As an example, an aggregator program might cache several resource inventories using TAPIR, and then keep the cache synchronized by subscribing to the feeds that describe changes to records in those inventories. </p>

 title : The entropydb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionEntropyDB is an embedded object database for Mac OS X 10.5 and iPhone OS written in Objective-C. It is built on top of SQLite. You can embed it in your own application or you can use it for RAD (Rapid Application Development) or Rapid Prototyping for iPhone with the open source Rapid tool. It has the following advantages: </p>

<p>It is simple to use since it is an object database, i.e., you don&#39;t have to use SQL but you only work with Objective-C objects. The database can be embedded in both OS X 10.5 applications and iPhone applications (the current version can be used in the iPhone Simulator). No configuration is required. Instances of descendants of NSObject can be stored directly without providing any additional information. Database contents can be synchronized among multiple database instances automatically. EntropyDB can be used similarly to db4objects (db4o). The current preview version is distributed as a static library and can be embedded in Xcode projects by adding the header files and the file libEntropyLib.a to Classes and Frameworks, respectively. </p>

 title : The eomono Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EOMono is an assembly that provides database access and command logic to an ODBC connected database similiar to the EOModel / EOEntity / EOGenericRecord from the NextStep / OpenStep database interface. </p>

<p>EOMono was created for a couple of reasons: </p>

<p>The ODBC provider in Mono is a very limited provider,  so many of the advanced features of the ADO model don&#39;t work.  This includes named parameters.  So code to access an ODBC connected database ends up being littered with string building code to create the required SQL. I really really don&#39;t like fiddling around with strings when I want to be doing application Logic. The Mono ODBC provider receives basically zero love from the Mono team, so one can&#39;t expect this situation to improve anytime in the near future. I&#39;ve used the EO model while working on OpenGroupware and using SOPE.  This framework is quite handy, sophisticated enough without being overly complicated.   EOMono is also influenced by the Logic layer in OpenGroupware which uses command objects to perform actions.  The Logic layer is simply the best encapsulation of function I&#39;ve ever seen.  </p>

<p>NOTE: EOMono isn&#39;t at all intended to be in any way &quot;compatible&quot; with EO or NextStep or to duplicate the syntax exactly.  It just borrows the ideas. </p>

<p>ObjectsEOModel - Represents a database or collection of tables. EOEntity - Represents a table, and its schema, in the database. EORecord - Represents a record in the database. EOConnection - Manages the connection to the database. EOCommand - Abstract parent class of database commands. EONull - Represents a NULL value. CommandsEOFetchCommand - Fetch: Used to retrieve records from a database. EOSetCommand - Set: Used to update a record in a database. EONewCommand - New: Used to insert a record into a database. EODeleteCommand - Delete: Used to delete a record from a database. You can also draft your own commands, and commands that go beyond simple database functionality;  for example code like:  </p>

<p>  try
<br/>  {
<br/>    connection.Run(&quot;:SyncGearWorksJobUpdates&quot;,
<br/>      &quot;proxy&quot;, &quot;tyr:3128&quot;,
<br/>      &quot;username&quot;, &quot;**********&quot;,
<br/>      &quot;password&quot;, &quot;*********&quot;,
<br/>      &quot;start&quot;, DateTime.Now.AddHours(-1.0).ToString(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:00.000&quot;),
<br/>      &quot;end&quot;, DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:99.999&quot;));
<br/>  } catch (Exception _exception) 
<br/>    {in one of our internal applications executes once an hour to syncronize some database tables with an external SOAP web service;  the above command requests the data and performs Fetch / Set / New commands to update the database. </p>

<p>Commands are just objects that implement the very simple IEOCommand interface,  although most of the time it is sensible to also inherit from the abstract EOCommand object.  Command objects are then mapped to names via an EOCommandAttribute attribute on the class: </p>

<p>  [EOCommandAttribute(&quot;SyncGearWorksJobUpdates&quot;, 1, &quot;Get job updates from Gearworks&quot;)]
<br/>  public class GetUpdatedJobs : EOCommand, IEOCommand

 title : The godwhale Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The capabilities of the brain far exceed those of any modern day computer.  
<br/>The primary reason for this difference is the attempt by the computer to only simulate the function of one hemisphere--the left. As we know from the work of many and most importantly Dr. Roger Sperry, the left hemisphere is devoted to the processing of linear sequential information coming from a pattern stream. 
<br/>The right hemisphere, however, is devoted to the visual, simultaneous processing of images. Though both hemispheres receive input from both eyes, what they do with the information is quite different. The right hemisphere uses memories (stored as pieces connected by axon associations) of images to interpret larger, more complex images. These images are interpreted and the summary is sent from the right hemisphere to the left. This feedback loop of information going back and forth between the two hemispheres, each with their own separate memory structures, is the essence of what makes consciousness and what is ultimately required for success of the Godwhale project. 
<br/>The unique approach this takes is its attempt to actually ride along with the human brain in its function. Rather than try to create a new evolutionary success, we try to infer and deduce how the brain stores images. 
<br/>Here are some background facts, in no particular order: 
<br/>The left hemisphere is devoted to linear sequential processing of pattern stream information. The left hemisphere is mostly gray matter with less white matter. This makes sense when consider how the memory of words is mostly not association intensive. It&#39;s intensive of single memory slots. Grey matter is neurons, essentially memory slots. 
<br/>The right hemisphere is devoted to visual simultaneous processing of pattern stream information but in not just one dimension of feed over time but two or more dimensions of feed over time. The right hemisphere is mostly white matter with only a rind of cortex at the top. This makes sense as we know the brain stores an image not by storing the entire image but through axon-dendrite links with other neurons that represent that piece of the image. Understand: in the brain, there is a neuron that is devoted to seeing a line that runs at an angle of 1 o&#39;clock. Another neuron is devoted to seeing a line at 2 o&#39;clock. A triangle, then, is composed of an 8 o&#39;clock, a 4 o&#39;clock and a 3 o&#39;clock. To remember long term that triangle, the brain stores a link that associates those three other neurons. 
<br/>After many hundreds of false starts, (as evidenced by the code I will shortly upload) I have come to the conclusion that I need to first create a system that takes temporal visual field inputs, linear numeric inputs, and that the two will be linked in a feedback loop. At first, I will introduce a single point into the visual field. Whatever the system names the point, it will be remembered under that name. Then, it will keep absorbing things it sees for the first time with the goal of having it recognize that two lines at an angle are not just a new object but are, rather, two earlier lines it has seen and memories.  
<br/>The memory that will take place on both the left (linear sequential) and the right (visual simultaneous) sides will be designed to hold a distinct piece of information: a word, a line, a point, something worth memorizing, and then the associations. The first and distinctive phase will be the learning of these sensory inputs and automatically logging them as learning. The first draft of this project that I published on Google Code used a test dataset that was canned and I now believe that is the wrong approach. It must first learn how to learn--and then how to recognize something it has learned. 
<br/>Unfortunately, each hemisphere will have a variant of this process and neither can be skipped. 
<br/>My major decision is to proceed in a Darwinist way, with the success or failure of each iteration being decided on the basis of what it actually learns or predicts. 
<br/>I welcome any input. 
<br/>of this is defunct and superceded by what what is above. </p>

<p>This project will design and build the Godwhale, a personal companion based on artificial intelligence, as described in the books &quot;Half Past Human&quot; and &quot;The Godwhale&quot; by TJ Bass. 
<br/>This is a highly ambitious project and it includes several phases that may not be possible at this time, such as: 
<br/>) Speech Module--this module will convert human speech to XML. Human speech to text--this may not be achievable at this time. Text to XML--the end result of this will be an Idea file that contains a single idea. During the initial phases of the project, a hand-coded copy of this file will represent the starting point.    </p>

<p>2.) Thought Module--this module will process the thought-XML file and take actions. 
<br/>Parse the XML Determine keywords, process idea, generate actions. </p>

<p>3.) Action Module--this module will implement actions based on the thoughts. 
<br/>Trigger searches to answer questions. Identify things that need to be pursued. Communicate with the user any outcome from the searches or other actions. 4.) Memory Module--this module will persist any information based on the prior modules. 
<br/>Save keywords. Save associations between keywords. This may be most important of all.        </p>

<p>Aspects of this project will include an XML format for modeling thought.</p>

 title : The golconde Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Golconde (gŏl-kŏn&#39;də) is a queue based replication solution for PostgreSQL written in Python 2.6.   </p>

<p>It is designed to be loosely coupled and rely upon existing enterprise messaging systems that have STOMP protocol support.  Designed to scale easily and with multi-data center implementations in mind, the application and message queues for distribution live outside of the database.  By decoupling Golconde from PostgreSQL it is differentiated from existing replication solutions, moving the workload from the database tier, where CPU, RAM and IO overhead can be very expensive, to a commodity layer where the operational cost for performing the data distribution work is much less expensive.  In a typical Golconde target database, the PostgreSQL operational overhead is similar to the canonical database write workload. </p>

<p>The preferred method of operation is to use one of the Golconde client classes, currently available for PHP and Python.  The Golconde client classes allow you to perform write level activity such as adding, deleting, setting and updating data.  Example flow diagrams and code can be found on the GolcondeExamples page. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you may use the golconde_util.py script to generate on update/delete/insert triggers which will kick off the data distribution cycle within PostgreSQL.  You can see an example of this flow on the GolcondeTrigger page. </p>

<p>It is designed to be modular, allowing for different behaviors based upon the target database, including a 2-phase commit like behavior on failure of distribution to any node.  Because it is designed for eventual consistency and loosely-coupled operation, it is most similar to BASE as described by Dan Pritchett. </p>

<p>Here is the presentation from pgCon 2009. </p>

<p>Golconde is named for the famous painting by René Magritte.</p>

 summary : <p>HIT-MW Database Homepage(This database is to facilitate the offline recognition of general-purpose Chinese handwritten text) </p>

<p>1. Links1) The Chinese version homepage of HIT-MW database is located at http://hi.baidu.com/hitmw/ .  </p>

<p>  2) The English version is put at http://code.google.com/p/hit-mw-database/ (this site) and http://hitmwdb.googlepages.com/ . </p>

<p>  3) A counterpart database produced by Single Writer (named HIT-SW database) had already released at http://hitswdb.googlepages.com . </p>

<p>2. SummaryWe motivate to research the general purpose Chinese character recognition (Part of the recent results have been published as a serial of papers). After three years&#39; work, we compiled HIT-MW (HIT is the abbr. of Harbin Institute of Technology, and MW means it is written by Multiple Writers), a handwritten Chinese text database for the first time in handwriting recognition domain.  </p>

<p>Comparing to previous handwritten databases, our database has at least three distinctions. First, the handwriting is naturally written with no rulers that can be used to make the text-line straight by and large. This feature makes it suitable for conducting experiments on Chinese text-line segmentation. Second, the underlying texts for handcopying are sampled from China Daily corpus in a systematic way and the writers are carefully chosen to give a balanced distribution. Third, it is collected by mail or middleman instead of face to face, resulting in some real handwriting phenomena, such as miswriting and erasing.  </p>

<p>Besides text-line segmentation, the HIT-MW is fit to research segmentation-free recognition algorithms, to conduct handwriting identification experiments (The dataset is available upon request and here is a brief summary ), to evaluate your signature verification algorithms (This kind of dataset is under construction), to verify the effect of statistical language model (SLM) in real handwriting situation, and to study the nerve mechanism of Chinese handcopying activity.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Till now, at least THIRTY Institutes or Universities are using HIT-MW database in their experiments over the world. Though the database can be downloaded freely, you need an authority letter from us before publishing your papers (Here is an template of authority letter ).  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>In HIT-MW database, more than 780 participants produce their handwriting naturally. We have collected 853 legible Chinese handwriting samples. There are 186,444 characters in total including letters, punctuations besides Chinese characters, and these characters lead to 8,664 text lines. By simple computation, we get following statistics: Each sample has 10.16 text lines; Each text line has 21.51 characters; Each sample includes 218.57 characters. More specific information is briefly described below. </p>

 title : The hitswdatabase Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HIT-SW database is to facilitate the offline recognition of writer-dependent Chinese handwritten text. You can download it freely here. 1 OverviewA database of Chinese handwritten document is collected by our institute to evaluate the recognizer. It is written by a single writer, therefore we name it HIT-SW database (HIT is the abbr. of Harbin Institute of Technology, and SW means it is produced by a single writer) hence after. The homepage of HIT-SW database in English is http://hitswdb.googlepages.com/ and the Chinese version is put at http://hi.baidu.com/hitmw/ . </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>The underlying text of HIT-SW database is randomly sampled from China Daily corpus. We ask the writer to handcopy the text with no ruler as reference on A4 size papers. The final samples are digitalized with a resolution of 300 DPI, and then binarized using Otsu algorithm. Totally there are 83 handwritten documents capturing some important aspect of real handwriting, such as miswriting, erasure, character touching, document skewness et al. A counterpart database produced by multiple writers (HIT-MW database) had already released at http://hitmwdb.googlepages.com . </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>In our text line separation system, the global projection profile is executed to extract the straight border lines. However we find it unsatisfactory. Then we perform skew correction to improve the recall rate of text lines. After that, global projection profile is performed again. Using this technique, all of 798 text lines are succesfully extracted.  We randomly draw 200 of them as test set (4,926 characters), 500 as train set (12,670 characters), and the remainders as validation set (1,470 characters). The validation set here is used to tune the parameters which will be used to evaluate the recognizer&#39;s performance on test set.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a new sheriff in town!Well, I wouldn&#39;t say sheriff so much as someone that doesn&#39;t want to see a project like this fall by the wayside.  We use it where I work and I&#39;ve offered to &quot;take over&quot; maintaining the code.  Does that mean there&#39;ll be a new version out?  Not anytime real soon.  In fact, I hate to admit that I haven&#39;t done much of anything with the code as of yet. </p>

<p>So, if you find bugs, have requests, have a question or just feel chatty, post away.  I&#39;ll do my best to answer any and all questions as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>I would like to thank Nate (and all the other contributers) for the tremendous amount of work he has done on libstats.  I can&#39;t speak for him directly, but I&#39;m willing to bet he&#39;s lurking in the shadows listening in should there be any questions that I am unable to answer. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding as I come up to speed on all things libstats. </p>

<p>Nate&#39;s farewellHi all, </p>

<p>After four years of development, I&#39;m leaving my current job and leaving this project an orphan. I&#39;d love for someone else to take up the mantle and make the project great -- or at least keep it from succumbing to bit rot. If you&#39;d like to be maintainer of a small, fairly simple open-source project, head to our discussion group and get in touch. </p>

<p>Thanks to all who have used libstats and helped to make it better. </p>

<p>Cheers! -Nate</p>

 title : The lingoblog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main driving force behind Lingoblog is to provide a blogging engine that supports groups who want to communicate in multiple languages. I&#39;d like the engine to be as easy to set up as possible. Currently its extremely lightweight as there are only a few files in here ;-) It&#39;s still in the very early stages of development. I literally started it 4 hours before writing this at 4.00pm Sunday 3rd February 2008. </p>

<p>Rough and ready roadmap: </p>

<p>1) Homebrewed PHP framework that does not use the MVC pattern. </p>

<p>2) Automatic language detection. </p>

<p>3) Web interface for blogging / uploads. </p>

<p>4) Translation of blog articles into multiple languages by group members. </p>

<p>5) Support for images and custom formatting. </p>

<p>6) Switchable themes and styles. </p>

<p>7) Other stuff as and when I think of it. </p>

<p>Whether or not to use a framework :-/ </p>

<p>I&#39;ve started to go off some of the existing Web 2.0 frameworks - especially PHP ones. I&#39;ve decided to make my own framework for this project. My challenge is to &#39;NOT&#39; use the MVC pattern. Otherwise I would use an existing framework right ;-) The MVC pattern was invented in 79 and I&#39;d like to finally get away from Afro&#39;s, flared trousers and sugariness as we approach the end of the naughties! The framework I&#39;m thinking about will be easier to understand, develop in and will be a lot more flexible than the majority of frameworks out there. Ok lets get to work ;-)</p>

 title : The mysql-copy-database Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryA python script used to copy a MySQL database (including all relevant privileges) from one host to another, used as a wrapper around mysql and mysqldump. </p>

<p>For a full run down of usage instructions and options, run: mysql_copy_database -h </p>

<p>To test the script without making any changes, run: mysql_copy_database --dry-run </p>

<p>The script works roughly as follows: </p>

<p>You&#39;ll be prompted for source/destination host information, and the name of the DB to copy mysqldump will be used to dump the database to a temporary file The dumped database is re-created on the destination host The script will search for grants that appear relevant to the database on the source host You&#39;ll be prompted to apply each grant to the destination host </p>

<p>And that&#39;s it! </p>

<p>It&#39;s currently been tested on various linux and solaris systems, with MySQL versions 4 and 5. </p>

<p>To change any of the basic configuration settings, just edit them within the Settings class at the top of the file.  All options should be documented within it. </p>

<p>Any comments/suggestions/feature requests are more than welcome. </p>

<p>RequirementsSoftwareMySQL client The script uses the mysql and mysqldump binaries, and looks for them in /usr/bin unless an alternative location is specified in the script&#39;s settings. </p>

<p>Python ModulesThe follow python modules are used by the script: </p>

 title : The n-cat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>N-CATNumismatic Database Management for the Historian and Collector. </p>

<p>The software is build with embedded Firebird (Interbase) database engine and Qt C++ framework. </p>

<p>Update to the newest version  - view update instructions below. </p>

<p>Support most of NUDS fields (Numismatic Database Standard for column-oriented numismatic data sets) and additionally not limited number of images, documents and references per item. Designed for work with huge data sets. </p>

<p>Powerful and reliable embedded database engine. Easy backup and restore. Independent format. Relational database design. Not limited number of images, references, etc. per item. Build-in image viewer with rotation and scale support. Import from and export to Microsoft XML Speadsheet format, supported by Excel and OpenOffice. Run SQL query. Browse external databases, save data in Microsoft XML Spreadsheet file. Unicode support. Unicode character browser/input. Multiplatform. Runs on Linux and Windows (and also MacOS, but MacOS is not yet tested). And many more features... Installation Use local drive for installation. The embedded database should not be placed on network drive. Use NTFS file system if possible.  Choose installer or zip archive. If archive is taken - unpack it, open &quot;N-CAT&quot; directory and double-click at &quot;ncat.exe&quot; to start the application. Note: the installer and the application does not write anything into windows system directories and does not open any TCP ports - the embedded database works over local access. Update To update existing 1.x.x.x installation: download latest &quot;win32 update&quot; from &quot;Downloads&quot; section. Put the zip file into your N-CAT installation directory. Extract files (&quot;Extract here&quot;), confirm overwriting. You can also run installer and install over existing N-CAT 1.X.X installation, but be careful - don&#39;t overwrite your build-in database file (&quot;COLL0.FDB&quot;), the installer will ask about. Update to the newest version is recommended. Quick StartConnection dialog appears at application start-up. Click &quot;OK&quot; to connect to build-in embedded database. The database schema is divided into several collections. First collection, opened by default, may contain several demo entries. Documentation is in not yet released. Tip - try RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK to access menus. Note: on Windows platform only one process can access the database file, you can not start multiple instances of N-CAT (or any other Firebird utilities) connected to the same database - connection will not succeed. Linux has little different architecture of embedded database server and you can start multiple instances of N-CAT connected safely to the same database, but it is not really useful for particular software. </p>

<p>Backup and restore </p>

<p> Backup and restore are essential for successful management of data sets. Backup and restore also rebuild indexes and shrink size of the database, giving back space of deleted items and improved indexes. Backup file has smaller size as database file and can be additionally compressed. Try backup and restore before you start creation of important data sets. </p>

<p>Images </p>

<p> Image can be stored as binary object inside the database (&quot;BLOB&quot; option), as link to the image file on local filesystem (&quot;LINK&quot; option) or as http link (&quot;URL&quot; option). &quot;Link&quot; and &quot;URL&quot; options do not store or modify image data, only reference is stored in the database. Selected images of obverse, reverse and edge can be set for item preview. Images can be viewed with build-in image viewer, copied to clipboard and saved (format, size and compression are adjustable). </p>

<p>Import existing column-orientated data sets from Excel </p>

<p> Open your Excel or OpenOffice Spredsheet file. One worksheet can be  imported at once. Save the whole file or selected worksheet as Microsoft XML Speadsheet file (again - XML file, not usual Excel XLS file).  Start N-CAT. Connect to database. Go to &quot;Collection&quot;-&gt;&quot;Import Data&quot;-&gt;&quot;Import from MS XML Spreadsheet&quot;. Select newly created Microsoft XML Speadsheet file, worksheet and destination collection. Table view with the data will appear - MAP THE COLUMNS double-clicking at the first (dark blue) row of the table view. Note: Fields marked yellow require special format, like integer or floating point, use reserved field if your data format doesn&#39;t match! &quot;Description&quot;, marked blue, can be used MULTIPLE times, the data will be applied to item&#39;s description. </p>

<p>More databases </p>

<p>The software is not limited by one build-in database. It is possible to create more databases over backup/restore procedure. Documentation follows. Note: one database contains many collections and can take huge data sets, creating of additional databases is optional. It is also possible - having some Firebird/Interbase knowledge - to set up an independent Firebird server installation, create database from N-CAT backup file and access it with N-CAT as client over network. </p>

 summary : <p>Ouroboros is a tool to help storytellers manage a database of characters, props, locations, effects, plots, notes, ideas, etc. It handles character personality archetypes &amp; advancement, plot events, printing &amp; reporting, charts, and some limited ability to manage a playwright&#39;s player information. It is intended to be intuitive and flexible enough to be used by authors, playwrights, screen-writers, directors, and roleplaying game managers. </p>

<p>Ouroboros exposes a cross-platform open api for creating, managing and exchanging character and plot data. Whether you run Dungeons &amp; Dragons, GURPs or World of Darkness, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t use the same story, scenario and character descriptions. When you get a good idea you should be able to record it. Hero Lab is a similar, commercial product which focuses solely on game mechanics. Write-it-Now is another product which focuses primarily on the narrative. Ouroboros should combine features of both apps. </p>

<p>Key Design GoalsIntended to be a game administration tool. Key features are to include: </p>

<p>Cross platform compatibility: currently targeting Windows XP and Mac OS X System agnosticism (can be used for various gaming systems with appropriate plug ins) Support for game database queries and statistic gathering Due to our cross platform requirements Java is our primary reference implementation language of choice. Our web-based front-end is implemented in PHP.  </p>

<p>Key Features for AlphaInitially we are supporting White-Wolf&#39;s World of Darkness 2.0 system. The game database can be stored as XML files or can be backed by a relational database. </p>

<p>Key Features for BetaWill be set after alpha version released </p>

<p>Key Features for ReleaseWill be set after alpha release</p>

 title : The sptrwt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The SPT Relational Database Web Tool (RWT) is a simple application that can help developers connect to databases configured as a DataSource in the application server or directly through JDBC. The RWT application attempts to replicate basic features found in the popular Aqua Data Studio application. Per user settings (saved connection parameters, saved queries), single and batch query processing, a history browser, multiple query browsers, a tree view of database metadata, and other features are supported.  Please read the manual for full details about the application, including simple use cases, features, installation instructions, etc.  You can view screen captures of the application under Downloads.  Source code for the application is available in subversion. </p>

<p>FeaturesThe following are the basic features provided by the tool: </p>

<p>Connect to databases configured in application server as DataSources. Configured DataSources are displayed in the application menu. Display a Connection dialogue through which users may specify the parameters for directly connecting to a database through JDBC. The connection parameters may be saved in which case the Connection will be added to the application menu of available databases. Display in a Tree the following types of database objects available in the connected database.  The schemas accessible to the user.  The tables available under a schema.  The views available under a schema.  The procedures and functions available under a schema.  The triggers defined in a schema.  The constraints (primary and foreign keys) defined in a schema. A query exeecution tool launched through a menu (multiple windows are supported). The query tool makes the following features available:  A free text area in which the user enters the query they wish to execute.  An optional text field which can be used to limit the maximum number of matching records fetched from the database.  A “Save” button that can be used to save the current query for easy access via a menu in the future.  The results of the query are displayed in tabular format. The results are pageable for convenience.  The results of the query can be exported to Excel through a “Export to Excel” button. Databases TestedPostgreSQL 8.2 Oracle 10.2.0.2.0 MySQL 5.0.41 Sybase 12.50 MS SQL Server 9.00.3077 DB2 Express-C - Works only partially.  DB2 JDBC driver does not allow scrollable cursors when tables contain LOB/XML types. PostgreSQL JDBC driver and the JTDS driver for Sybase and MS SQL Server are included with the downloaded package (and in subversion).  Other drivers are not included due to licencing restrictions (we could include the Oracle driver, but have no means of controlling downloads from export restricted countries).</p>
 title : The squirtle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to SquirtleThe purpose of this little doodad is to help you prove to your employer, your client, your best friend, your dog, or God that NTLM is truly dead. It does this by taking control of any browser that comes into contact with it and making it perform NTLM authentication at will. By using a set of API calls you can embed Squirtle into existing penetration toolkits, proxies or other fun tools at your disposal. </p>

<p>The latest version of Squirtle should always be obtained with your SVN client of choice: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://squirtle.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ squirtle-read-only </p>

<p>Squirtle Attack ScenariosXSS == Domination </p>

<p>Thanks to Internet Explorer&#39;s automatic security zones, servers on the &#39;inside&#39; are typically within the &quot;Trusted Zone&quot; by default. This means IE will negotiate and send NTLM credentials at the drop of a hat. With one cross site scripting vulnerability or even basic social engineering it&#39;s possible to now grab these hashes with a static nonce like crazy. Sure it&#39;s been done via SMB but this is HTTP! </p>

<p>More background here: http://grutz.jingojango.net/exploits/pokehashball.html -- Squirtle performs this attack by default when a user connects to it. </p>

<p>Pass The Dutchie </p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard of &quot;Pass The Hash&quot; and SMBRelay attacks where the attacker uses the LM/NT hashes to connect to SMB shares, right? Here&#39;s a new attack I&#39;m calling &quot;Pass The Dutchie&quot;. </p>

<p>Past attack methods have been focused on single-threaded attacks, either against a single server/resource or back to the client connecting. With Squirtle a client browser is held and asked to perform NTLM authentication at any time opening attacked resources to be any number of web servers, SMB shares, SQL Servers, etc.</p>

The course covers design patterns as well as development practices such as version control, testing, automated builds, etc., in the context of a moderate sized project. The course is taught by Douglas M. Kline. We will implement a Virtual Campus Supercomputer Center (VCSC) using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Using the BOINC application frameworks, we will write a distributed data analysis system which will initially feature an &#39;all possible combinations&#39; linear regression module. The data analysis system will consist of a web-based Researcher Interface, a web-based Contributor Interface, a windows-based Contributor Client Screen Saver, and a linux server-based Data Analysis Component. The goal for the semester is to have a functioning VCSC running large-scale regressions using contributed computing time from many independent PCs. If time allows, we may be able to implement other data analysis modules such as a feed-forward neural network, a quadratic regression, bayesian data reduction,  etc. </p>

 title : The allan Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it about?As a programmer, you know the problem: you are good in one programming language, but you will or you are forced to do programming works in another language. The paradigm is the same, you may say. Yes, but every languages has it&#39;s own specific syntax and different level of abstraction. It will take an experienced programmer days or even weeks to be able to work with a new language. Even so, you need to look up in reference books about certain syntax, like What does the class declaration in C++ looks like? </p>

<p>A Paradigm driven online ReferenceALLAN is the acronym of All Languages. With the project ALLAN, we are aiming at a paradigm driven online reference for all programming languages. The user just need to input a keyword, then he will get articles for languages he selected. With ALLAN, you never need to look up in thick reference books, and as ALLAN will use a wiki-engine, you get the opportunity to edit the items or add new items. </p>

<p>What we have done and what we are going to doThe idea ALLAN is just couple days old. We are now brainstorming on features of the project. If you have any Ideas, just drop a line to Jing and Shaohui</p>

 title : The booleannet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Boolean Network ModelingThe goal of this software package is to provide intuitive and accessible tools for simulating biological regulatory networks in a boolean formalism. Using this simulator biologist and bioinformaticians can specify their system in a simple textual language then explore various dynamic behaviors via a web interface or an application programming interface (API) each designed to facilitate scientific discovery, data collection and reporting. </p>

<p>The software is primarly distributed as Python source code and requires that Python 2.5 (or later) be installed on the target computer.  </p>

<p>Bugfix NoteJanuary 7, 2010. Please note that versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.4 of the BooleanNet package have  a bug that cause the node updates to execute in original (listed) order during the first iteration, before randomizing the order of nodes for subsequent iterations. This bug affects only the asynchronous update mechanism.  </p>

<p>The net effect of the bug is that for certain type of rules the first execution of them may funnel the states into the basin of one of the attractors. Overall the answers will not be incorrect but, depending on the rules and order of nodes they may be incomplete. Please update to the latest version. My apologies. Istvan Albert </p>

<p>IntroductionWhen trying to understand the role and functioning of a regulatory network, the first step is to assemble the components of the network and the interactions between them. The experimental advances in the large scale mapping of regulatory networks are fairly recent, but modeling efforts date back to the end of 1960s thanks to the pioneering work of Stuart Kauffman and Rene Thomas. </p>

<p>In a Boolean representation we assume that nodes are equivalent, and their interactions form a directed graph in which each node receives inputs from its neighbors (nodes that are connected to it). The state of nodes is described by binary (ON/OFF) variables, and the dynamic behavior of each variable, that is, whether it will be ON or OFF at next moment, is governed by a Boolean function. In general, a Boolean or logical function is written as a statement acting on the inputs using the logical operators and, or and not and its output is ON(OFF) if the statement is true (false). </p>

<p>DocumentationA detailed documentation is available on our external website. This documentation is also included in the source code distribution. See the: </p>

<p>Installation  Tutorials  for a quick overview on how the make the library work for you.  </p>

<p>About the libraryNote as of version 1.2 (Nov 12, 2008) the library has acquired several new features (see below) and underwent a substantial reorganization. To keep old code from interfering with new one the library namespace has been changed to boolean2 </p>

<p>In this software package, we implement mutliple advanced methodologies which combine discrete logical rules with more realistic assumptions regarding the relative timescales of the  processes: </p>

<p>synchronous updates are performed in listed order, but the states change only at the end of the update round asynchronous updates are performed in random order and the states immediately reflect the changes, this makes the model stochastic.  ranked asynchronous updates are performed in rank order, within the same rank the updates take place asynchronously time synchronous update are performed in time. Each rule has a time delay associated with them, updates take place at multiples of these delays piece wise differential updates associate a set of continuous variables (concentrations, decay rates and thresholds) to each discrete variable in the system. The dynamics of these continuous variables is determined by a linear system of piecewise differential equations, leading to a hybrid model in the manner first suggested by Leon Glass and collaborators.  </p>

<p>Example RulesHere are a few example rules for BooleanNet covering various research projects. Most of these rules were collected via a thorough literature search and were manually curated into their final form. These rules are available in the examples/samples directory of the source code distribution. </p>

 title : The buddyfusion Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Problem StatementAs theory and practice shows social networks ought to get a more and more important impact for the life of modern people. An unmeasurable amount of social networks exists within the World Wide Web, each one with its own social purpose, its advantages or disadvantages and it’s very special focus concerning aim and target group.  Deduced from all these networks people get not only confused by the variety but also overstrained by maintaining all their personal profiles. Besides it’s not always obvious, what network to use for a certain service; user initiated tasks (messages, blogs) are not available from each network, often services are liable to pay costs. Furthermore this effect results in multiple definitions of friendships with the same person in different networks without having any relation or correlation between them. Another issue of current social network is the representation of social relationships between persons. Not only that most of the networks show lists of friends just in a tabular format without visual intuitive acquisition, also translative relations aren’t visualized in a clear and reproducible way. </p>

<p>ApproachThe aim of this exercise is to develop an application to visualize social relationships of persons among various platforms. Persons are represented as nodes and connections between those nodes give information about their relationships. Furthermore the presence of a certain person within diverse networks shall be displayed and made clearly arranged. To support various platforms the intended application is based on a multi layer visualization, wherein the user should be even able to aggregate one person’s accounts among several platforms to define one physical person out of it. </p>

<p>ImplementationThe implementation of the application is ought to be based on the Java Programming Language. For the visual representation the visualization toolkit Prefuse (www.prefuse.org) will be used. As Java Applications are usually not able to be executed over the Web, additional technology is necessary. Webstart http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws not only allows us to execute an usual Java Desktop Application over the Http Protocol but also supports features like incremental updates and downloads. For testing our application we will create XML based data (dummy data) of persons with relationships from various platforms. </p>

<p>Graphical VisualizationThe following figures show the future functionality of the planned prototype. Figure 1 exemplifies the basic visualization of the different social network platform after the import of the XML (dummy) data. This visualization is ego-centered and the persons connected appear within their social network platforms. Obviously people appearing in different networks are displayed as doubles. The graph is network centered.   </p>

<p>Basic Network Centered View </p>

<p>After the import the prototype shall be able to suggest the merger of possible identical persons, as shown in next paragraph.   </p>

<p>Suggested Merger of Doubles </p>

<p>As a result of this suggestion the graph shows the social network of the user in a different and partly simplified way (next figure). Information on the social network platforms a certain person utilizes is visualized via multiple connections to one merged node.   </p>

<p>Partly Simplified Graph </p>

<p>According to the knowledge of the user of his personal network it shall be possible to merge all identical persons. Figure 4 presents the result of a manual merger of all identical persons. The focus of the graph is now adjusted to a more person centered view instead of a network centered view.   </p>

 title : The ccnitdgp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An online judge is an online system to test programs in programming contests. They are also used to practice for such contests. The system can compile and execute your code, and test your code with pre-constructed data. Submitted code may be run with restrictions, including time limit, memory limit, security restriction and so on. The output of the code will be captured by the system, and compared with the standard output. The system will then return the result.  This judge runs on Linux machines.  The main drive and motivation behind this project is to inculcate the culture of programming among students, helping them understand the importance of algorithms as a problem solving tool, and making them recognise the power of Linux as a powerful programming platform. The judge is built using opensource technologies and tools. Currently, it judges programs written in C/C++ only, but support for other languages may be added very easily. </p>

<p>When this project was undertaken by us, its aim was to extract the programming talent hidden in our college students by organising an intra-lan programming contest every week. The Linux Users&#39; Group wanted to be active all the year round. With its active support, its first run itself was successful with 1100 submissions in a span of 10 hours. Having tested the software on our college lan 7-8 times, it was decided that CodeCracker would host a national level online programming contest during MUKTI ,NIT Durgapur&#39;s national level tech fest on free and open source software, on 4th and 5th January. In colleges a common problem is that though there are good programmers, they are hesitant to contribute to the opensource movement. Through this software we encouraged our friends to use GCC as the standard compiler, and we distributed several versions of Linux on our lan in the course. There was a phenomenal rise in the number of Linux users since then and people took to programming actively. Having found some of the best coders in our college through CodeCracker, we now plan to found the Software Development Unit(LUG SDU), a new arm of LUG comprising of members selected from the winners of CodeCracker events held in the college. This unit will be involved actively in developing and contributing to opensource projects.</p>

 title : The cologo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cologo is collaborative web-based programming environment.  Cologo&#39;s most likely uses are education and experimentation, but its features are amenable to a variety of uses. </p>

<p>Cologo programs are written in Google Spreadsheets, and multiple people can collaborate over the web to write and edit code and documentation.  A spreadsheet can include procedure definitions, comments, formatted text, and data used by the program, all in one sheet.  Users can collaborate on data sets as well as programs. </p>

<p>The runtime environment is a Gadget, configured to use a spreadsheet-like data source for the program code.  The gadget is typically inserted onto the Google Spreadsheet containing the program, but it can also be added to a iGoogle page, any web page, or any compatible gadget container.  The Gadget can use any data source compatible with the Google Visualizations API.  Google Spreadsheets provides collaborative editing, and updates the gadget with changes in real-time. </p>

<p>The programming language is a faithful variant of Logo, including turtle graphics.  Cologo uses slightly different syntax than traditional Logo to make the best use of the spreadsheet layout for programs.  The Cologo interpreter can be paused and resumed for inspection of variables and debugging. </p>

<p>The Cologo engine is implemented entirely in web browser JavaScript, using the Gadget and Google Visualization APIs.  The turtle graphics system uses the HTML 5 canvas feature supported by Firefox, Safari, and Opera, and works with Internet Explorer using an HTML canvas plugin.  Cologo can be used in a browser without canvas support with the turtle features disabled. </p>

<p>This Google Code project is for the development of the Cologo runtime environment, gadget and language.  For more information on using Cologo, visit the Cologo website: http://www.cologo-lang.org/</p>
 title : The comp-lang-polyglot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Polyglot Programming Project gathers specifications for short scripts (programs), which are then written in multiple programming languages such as java, perl, php, python, rebol, ruby, etc. </p>

<p>Each script (or program) is a short recipe, phrase, or set of phrases. Scripts are normally less than 10 lines of code. Scripts are almost always less than 48 lines of code. However, the goal is to write the same script (matching the same specification) in all languages. </p>

<p>The goal is provide hundreds (maybe even thousands) of short specifications (program function descriptions), and then write a script that performs the function, and translations of that same script into every other popular language. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s the same concept as saying: </p>

<p>print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;   </p>

<p>in many computer languages, however,with the goal of translating many other phrases. </p>

<p>In many ways, we are similar to the PLEAC project (which is translating the Perl Cookbook into many other computer languages) --but we are focused on shorter recipes and phrases.</p>

 title : The cppagent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This C++ class library provides a simple framework for developing soft real-time systems using an agent-based programming model.  The library is especially geared toward robotics applications. </p>

<p>The library incorporates ideas from flow-based programming, swarm AI, software componentry, and control theory. </p>

<p>In this context, an agent is a software component which: </p>

<p>processes and manipulates data streams, is autonomous, in that it requires no interaction from users or other agents, is entirely decoupled from other system components, has no interface (black-box view), operates in an independent thread of execution. </p>

<p>Data streams consist of well-defined datagrams which: </p>

<p>like UDP datagrams, are unreliable, unlike UDP datagrams, are ordered, unlike objects, are not explicitly bound to methods or events. </p>

<p>The agent-based programming model encourages engineers to design complex systems in terms of simple processing components (agents).  Agents are entirely unaware of other agents, making the agent-based model inherently component-based.  The server-client model is entirely dismissed, preventing any wait-for-response behavior.  In fact, since all inter-agent communication is unreliable, it is impractical to implement any hand shaking between agents.  This limitation encourages one-way data streams rather than two-way communication or RPC.</p>

 summary : <p>The Dao to programming: new generation programming languageIn the dao to programming, some new forms, such as 3(x+5)(4a(5b+A11)), where A11 means A1 in other programming, |x|, the absolute value of x, n!, the factorial of n, date and time format, file path, url, email address, a menu in the restaurant, and all that, would become legal source code. The language of the dao to programming will be defined through parameter grammar, and the grammar of dao will be dynamic, the syntax of the program can be changed at the programmer&#39;s will, the source of program will be parsed by a very general powerful Merge-Reduce algorithm, which I called mushroom algorithm.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pity that I can&#39;t use &quot;Dao&quot; as the project name on code.google, because there existed a project named dao on sourceforge before. So I used &quot;Daot&quot;, where dao means the dao to programming. &quot;t&quot; would be the extension name of the dao program source file. &quot;t&quot; can be pronounced as &quot;tao&quot; or &quot;dao&quot; as well, means English letter T t or Greek Letter τ Τ λ Λ, denotes that the way of human and the way of computerintersect. By the way, λ and Λ, or lambda, represent recursive function theory, which is an important part of the computer sciense. </p>

 title : The django-contract Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Programming by Contract for Django Pre-conditions  Post-conditions  Invariants  
<br/> Helps with testing!   Easier to find bugs!  django-contract is a django application providing Programming by Contract constraint checking in docstrings. The solution uses a modified version of contract.py by Terence Way. Originally presented for PEP 316 - Programming by Contract for Python. </p>

<p>Installation and configuration Examples and the Todo demo applicationSome examples of how you might use django contract Check out the example application for more details on how it all fits together Why should i use django contract?Makes it easy to add optional constraints on methods. You can run the development sever with a hardened environment, without additional performance penalty when deployed. Things like forms and input validation gets another level of checking while developing your apps. Code coverage is greatly increased when combined with traditional testing. Works with both unittests and doctests. (coverage with django-contract) NOT just for formal verification, formal specification and Hoare logic. Example workflow: </p>

<p>You define a Model with title = models.CharField(max_length=200) You come to think of that only whitespaces titles should not be allowed, so you define an invariant for the model: len(self.title.strip()) &gt; 0 Continue with the rest of the model definitions... You finally make the views and forms for submitting entries. First round of testing and everything seems to work, the title is not set to blank=True so the field is required. Step two is where you usually try to make a note to remember to check this in the form. Now you can write down a check right there while defining the models.  </p>

<p>While testing if someone tries to submit an entry with a title consisting of just some spaces its not just silently accepted. The InvariantViolationError is raised by all model methods trying to operate on a model with a whitespace title.    </p>

<p>Programming by Contract for PythonThe modified contract.py is included in this project mainly because modifications made are aimed at getting it to work together with django not patching contract.py per se. There is some really funky meta-programming/monkey-patching going on in contract.py, we gave up trying to understand the inner workings and settled on just making it work with django. </p>

 title : The eiffel-state Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EiffelState is a library and a visual editor supporting Automata-based programming in Eiffel programming language and EiffelStudio IDE. </p>

<p>The main ideas behind the project are the following: </p>

<p>The central notion of Object-oriented Automata-based programming is the automated class. Unlike a regular class in OOP the automated class is a model of an object with complex (or state-dependent) behavior. At each point such an object can be in one of the relatively small set of control states. Depending on the current control state the object can react differently to the same input. The logic of its behavior (the dependency between the control states and reactions, as well as transitions between control states) are captured in object&#39;s controller, which is essentially a finite automaton. To its clients an automated class looks just like any normal class. Inside it consists of a controller (responsible for behavior logic) and a control object, which is a regular class, responsible for behavior semantics.  One of the most convenient and vivid ways to describe automata is using State-Transition Diagrams (STD) - graphs that have control states as vertices and transitions as edges. Each transition can have a condition and an action. Condition may involve events (that correspond to feature names in O-O world) and queries on control object. Actions may involve commands to the control object. Some people hate visual software construction, thus we are providing a library that allows one to describe automated classes in Eiffel as directly as possible. We also provide a visual editor that allows one to view controllers of automated objects as STD and also construct and edit them visually. The Eiffel code generated from an STD will use the library mentioned above, and thus will be high-level and human readable. This should support transparency between two different views of the controller: the textual one and the graphical one, allowing the developer to switch from one to another at any point. </p>

 title : The encryption-journal Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Journal is a simple dialog based program written in Java.  The idea was to make something simple where I could type, but so that I could also quickly encrypt what I was typing and save it that way as well as quickly decrypt it if I wanted to load it again for editing or to review. </p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<p>Sun JDK/JRE 6 Eclipse 3.2.2 </p>

<p>The JournalPlugin sub-project is designed to be a stand-alone library used to write plugins for the journal.  The only requirement is to extend the JournalPlugin abstract class, and implement the abstract encrypt(String) method that returns a String.  The Encryption Journal will call that method by passing the text from the text area to it, then you can do any work on it in your encrypt method.  I&#39;ve tried to keep it all very simple, but the plugins won&#39;t work yet.  That is my next major piece of development.  Plugins work now. See News below! </p>

 title : The fdjs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FDJS is a simple libary that empowers javascript coders to work with a functional, declarative programming paradigm. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a running example: http://fdjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fdjs_ex1.htm </p>

<p>Remember the last time you were debugging a program and asked &quot;how did this variable ever get set to that value?&quot;  You were probably dealing with a path dependency--some series of steps occurred in an unexpected order and produced an unanticipated result.  Such problems are typical in the procedural, imperative programming paradigm we use in most programming languages. </p>

<p>Now imagine asking the same question of a cell on a spreadsheet.  If just one cell is showing an incorrect value, you need to look no further than the underlying formula which defines its value.  The cause and effect are closely coupled.  Moreover, the cell is internally consistent--only the formula can make the value &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, and it is path independent.  These two features describe the normal expectations of a functional, declarative programming paradigm. </p>

<p>It is possible to use functional, declarative programming practices even in some languages that are typically procedural and imperative, including Javascript. </p>

<p>FDJS demonstrates how Javascript user interface development can benefit from the functional declartive paradigm. </p>

 title : The fizz-buzz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is FizzBuzz?The first reference on the web I found to the &quot;FizzBuzz Question&quot; was in a Coding Horror blog post back on February 26, 2007. Although the author is quoting another blog post, this is where I first heard of the &quot;FizzBuzz Problem&quot;. FizzBuzz is a litmus test during interviews for software developers which essentially tries to answer the question, &quot;Can you write any software at all?&quot; with an extremely simple problem, stated as: </p>

<p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number and for the multiples of five print &quot;Buzz&quot;. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;. 
<br/>So, this is a project with FizzBuzz samples?No. This &#39;project&#39; contains all the work I do for various personal projects. I needed a free wiki and source code repository, so here I am. I&#39;m calling this fizz-buzz because I anticipate putting more than 10 years of code up here eventually. So, it kind of feels like a programmer litmus test of sorts. </p>

<p>Have added the &#39;Functional&#39; class that adds methods to the Object class. This makes it a little easier to start exploring functional style programming. </p>

<p>Getting StartedYou start by adding the following 2 lines to your Flex code in an an initialisation section. </p>

<p>import handy.Functional;
<br/>...
<br/>Functional.MakeSystemFunctional();Some simple examplesvar a:* = [1,23,1,&quot;beef&quot;,2,17,100];    //set up an Array
<br/>var b:Object = a.Select( function(i:Object):Boolean { return i &lt; 70 } );    //b is actually an Array
<br/>trace( b );    // b should contain [1,23,1,2,17] -- notice that the String is ignored</p>

<p>var c:Object = a.Reject( function(i:Object):Boolean { return i == 1 } );
<br/>trace( c );    // c should contain [23,&quot;beef&quot;,2,17,100]</p>

<p>a = [
<br/>  {a:1, b:11},
<br/>  {a:2, b:22},
<br/>  {a:3, b:33},
<br/>  {a:4, b:44},
<br/>  {a:5, b:55}
<br/>];
<br/>b = a.Find( function(i:Object):Boolean { return i.b == 44 } );
<br/>trace( b ); // b should be the object {a:4, b:44}This makes Searching and manipulating collections of Objects much easier/readable!</p>

 summary : <p>GenetiK (Genetic Kernel)GenetiK is a generic framework that supports evolutionary algorithms. </p>

<p>According to the evolutionary approach, solutions to particular problems can be represented as individuals of a population. For each individual, a particular function, called &#39;&#39;fitness&#39;&#39;, can be defined to associate a high fitness scores with &#39;good&#39; solutions. </p>

<p>Starting from any set of individuals, evolving this population (with a process that loosely resembles darwinian selection in biology) results, after a sufficient number of &#39;&#39;generations&#39;&#39;, in a new population of high-fitness individuals. In other words, starting from any set (even randomly generated) of potential solutions to a problem, it is possible to obtain new sets of progressively &#39;better&#39; solutions, eventually resulting in the selection of an optimal (or near-optimal) solution. </p>

<p>Therefore, depending on the nature of the problem to be solved, it is possible to find a good solution by expressing candidate solutions and their fitness in an appropriate way. Even adopting the same evolutionary algorithm, but two different representations of individuals and fitness, can lead to dramatically different results, therefore finding a good representation of individuals and their fitness is crucial to the success or failure of a particular application. </p>

<p>The idea behind the GenetiK project is to let users experiment with evolutionary computation without having to code from scratch the algorithm that deals with the evolution itself, but rather let them concentrate on their specific tasks and objectives. This allows users to focus on finding good representations for candidate solution, the best ways to measure fitness and other aspects, but, at the same time, allowing them to fine-tune the algorithm to their specific needs by customizing its behaviour, if required. </p>

<p>Project StructureThe GenetiK framework is divided in 5 subprojects: </p>

<p>genetiK -- that includes the common base classes genetiK::ga -- specialized in dealing with Genetic Algorithms genetiK::gp -- oriented towards Genetic Programming genetiK::gp::st -- dedicated to Strongly Typed Genetic Programming genetiK::util -- includes all the utility classes </p>

<p>Here you can find an UML diagram describing the structure of the framework. (Source XMI file, generated with Umbrello) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>genetiK provides the common evolutionary algorithms functionalities, while genetiK::ga, genetiK::gp and genetiK::gp::st contains the specific classes that should be extended to develop a specific solution. You can consult the annotated example (the genetic algorithm that comes with the library) to see how the framework can be used. </p>

<p>DocumentationPlease refer to HTML documentation for more information. </p>

<p>Getting the codeTo check out the current version of GenetiK use </p>

 title : The humbug Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>humbug is an esoteric programming language. Like other esoteric programming languages it eschews the bonds of user-friendliness to achieve the ultimate goal of a programming language - to be so obscure and mind-twisting that it&#39;s almost impossible to program in.</p>

<p>humbug&#39;s special feature is that it is programmed entirely in bugs - ie. the code itself has no meaning, only the bugs have meaning. So you program by using clever combinations of bugs. It&#39;s all a bit of fun.</p>

<p>humbug is the first programming language where the bugs in your code are the fundamental sematic construct. The reasoning is: if it&#39;s so hard to write a program without bugs why not make the bugs be the program?</p>

<p>A humbug program looks like a poorly written C program. But this is misleading - the C semantics are totally ignored and all the meaning of the program comes from the placement and types of bugs within the code. A very skilled humbug programmer can create programs which look like valid C but in fact have many bugs and only work correctly when executed as humbug.</p>

<p>Some other famous esoteric programming languages include Intercal and Brainf**k, so if humbug sounds fun you may want to check them out.</p>

 title : The iconinterpreter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Icon interpreter in JavaThis project contains an implementation of an interpreter for a small part of the Icon programming language and is the code product of a student project at the IT University of Copenhagen. The interpreter is written in Java 5.0 and may be studied and used in any way compliant with the GPL. The authors of the project suspects this may be of interest to other students interested in the implementation of programming languages. </p>

<p>Icon constructsThe implementation is focused on a specific method of modeling evaluation of a goal-directed language and thus only aims to support an illustrative amount of types and language constructs. Only the integer type is supported. This table shows how much of Icon is implemented in this version of the program: </p>

<p>+ -   Binary arithmetic operators.   -  Unary operator.   &lt; =  Binary (in)equality operators.   | &amp; ;  Connectives.   to  Integer generator (without step).   </p>

<p>About the implementationThe implementation is essentially a realization of the method illustrated in “Denotational semantics of a goal-directed language” (Gudeman, D.A, 1999, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 14(1), 107–125). </p>

<p>The interpreter makes use of the explicit representation of several continuations to model the backtracking and goal-directed evaluation which is the most interesting feature of the Icon programming language. </p>

<p>As part of the distributed code a parser implemented in Coco/R serves to map the concrete syntax of Icon to the abstract syntax encoded in the supplied Java classes. </p>

<p>Build in an object-oriented style, this implementation may, with relative little effort, be extended to support a wider range of Icon features and constructs. </p>

<p>Anyone interested in Icon in Java should checkout Jcon, a complete Java-implementation of Icon. </p>

<p>Getting startedAs mentioned this will only be of interest to people who want to study the code. This is not user software. </p>

<p>To check out the code with subversion and build it with ant; open your terminal or prompt and paste the following: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://iconinterpreter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ iconinterpreter 
<br/>cd iconinterpreter 
<br/>antTo run the interpreter write: </p>

<p>java -cp out iconinterpreter/Icon</p>

 title : The jsnapp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jsnap is a standalone server that acts as a middleware between clients that want to execute SQL statements -yet not want to deal with database programming issues like pooling, timeouts, cursors etc.- and database servers. </p>

<p>If Java is installed, running jsnap is as easy as running the script sh-server. No other external dependencies, all needed jar&#39;s are in the lib/ folder. Development started with JDK 1.5 and is now continuing with 1.6. Though not tested, it probably would work perfectly with 1.4. </p>

<p>Features1) Server configuration is done via an XML file and configuration can be modified on the fly even when the server is up and running. Server&#39;s outputs are done via log4j, configure it anyway (console, file, smtp etc.) you like. </p>

<p>2) Server configuration mainly consists of listeners and databases; listeners listen to TCP/IP requests from clients and databases are the resources on which accepted client requests are executed. One of the configured databases is the internal database that is used by the jsnap server for user/group management, access control and logging. </p>

<p>3) Listeners may accept requests of different types. That is, the way a request is encoded and transported is totally parametric. Requests could be sent via HTTP to a listener that is accepting HTTP connections or they could be sent via a user-defined protocol/transport over plain/secure sockets. Requests could be sent over an SSL connection regardless of the way they are encoded. </p>

<p>A listener is configured to accept a certain type of request, e.g. HTTPRequest, SSLRequest, from a certain port. jsnap server may be configured to run as many listeners as desired. </p>

<p>4) Databases are basically connection pools. Pool and connection management (connect/disconnect/ping/reconnect...) is performed by jsnap and clients are totally isolated from these processes. A connection management policy for each database is easily set via the configuration file also; jsnap could take databases online/offline (in terms of client access) according to the defined policy and the status of the database. </p>

<p>All databases with JDBC drivers could be managed by jsnap; however, this is not a strict requirement. Although not currently in place, support for other data sources (spreadsheets, text files etc.) could very easily be implemented. Also the generic JDBC driver could be extended (specialized) in order to take advantage of some features of the original JDBC drivers, e.g. Oracle&#39;s ping, Postgres&#39; cancelQuery etc. </p>

<p>5) jsnap server allows a client to execute a SQL statement. Moreover, a client may also ask the server to execute a SQL statement but keep the resultset open until a commit/rollback or timeout. That is, for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements, the client is able to delay the commit/rollback, disabling autocommit. This also means that, for the SELECT statements, the client may scroll over the query&#39;s output (if the database supports scrolling) or view only certain sections (in terms of row numbers) of the result set. </p>

<p>The server also allows the client to specify how the output of the executed SQL statement should be formatted. Currently, the client may receive outputs in CSV, HTML or XML format. Formatting is done transparently from the client; the only thing the client needs to do is to read from the socket. It is also very easy to implement a user-defined binary/ascii encoding for the result sets, allowing jsnap to work with, for example, Borland&#39;s datasets. </p>

<p>6) Java classes for Java clients are already in place. A Java client only needs to instantiate an object, fill in the SQL body, parameters, user credentials etc. and call send() to send the request; the call to receive() fetches all the requested data nicely formatted for processing. With jsnap, database access is equivalent to writing/reading from a socket. </p>

<p>Since database access is simplified to socket programming, it is possible to code in any programming language. For example, when coding with C it is easier to open a socket and write/read from it rather than working with low-level database libraries or precompilers. Even a web browser could be jsnap&#39;s client, an example SqlExecutor.html exists within the source. </p>

<p>7) jsnap allows setting an authentication policy and an access control policy for every database. jsnap server could allow/deny running a SQL statement according to the database&#39;s security policies. User based policies are implemented, group and IP address based policies are on the way, database object (e.g. tables, fields) based policies are planned. All access to databases are logged if required. </p>

<p>8) jsnap&#39;s web interface allows administrators and users to login for certain operations. Users, as expected, are only able to view limited features, whereas, administrators also perform user/group management and view statistics. </p>

<p>Ongoing1) FIRST AND FOREMOST: Documentation! (except inline.) </p>

<p>2) Several access control policies will be implemented. </p>

<p>3) Support for scheduling SQL statements will be implemented. </p>

<p>4) JDBC&#39;s timeout mechanism is not good enough; a better and generic timeout mechanism will be implemented. </p>

<p>5) Web interface will have more features. </p>

<p>6) Generic JDBC driver will be extended to take advantage of original JDBC drivers.</p>

 summary : <p>The classes library for analysis of large data arrays, based on new approach in the sphere of informatics - interval analyze.  </p>

<p>Interval analysis allows to describe a positional relationship of data arrays elements. The most frequent data arrays are discrete audio signals, linguistic and biological texts, images or any statistic data. </p>

<p>Traditionally, probabilistic approaches are used to research into such objects (data arrays). Except of Markovian chains and correlation dependences, which indirectly take account of positional relationship of data arrays elements, probabilistic approaches take account just only of the information about the quantitative composition of the data arrays. </p>

<p>Numerical characteristics, obtained with the help of interval analysis, can be used for solution of data mining (clustering, etc.) </p>

<p>That library will be developed basing on C#, adjusted for .NET technologies. This fact will allows to include that library in software developing basing on other programming languages. </p>

 title : The meta-aspectj Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Meta-AspectJ is a language tool for generating AspectJ programs using code templates. MAJ itself is an extension of Java, so users can interleave arbitrary Java code with AspectJ code templates. MAJ is a structured meta-programming tool: a well-typed generator implies a syntactically correct generated program. MAJ promotes a methodology that combines aspect-oriented and generative programming. Potential applications range from implementing domain-specific languages with AspectJ as a back-end to enhancing AspectJ with more powerful general-purpose constructs. In addition to its practical value, MAJ offers valuable insights to meta-programming tool designers. It is a mature meta-programming tool for AspectJ (and, by extension, Java): a lot of emphasis has been placed on context-sensitive parsing and error-reporting. As a result, MAJ minimizes the number of meta-programming (quote/unquote) operators and uses type inference to reduce the need to remember type names for syntactic entities.</p>
 title : The midas-judge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Midas is a Programming Competition System, oriented to competitions such as the ACM ICPC. We offer this as a (nearly) zeroconf alternative to PC^2. </p>

<p>We admire the CSUS PC2 team&#39;s work because it is a very complete piece of software, but we have also encountered some of its flaws. One of them -the one that give us most trouble- is the fact that PC2&#39;s implementation relies on Java&#39;s RMI. </p>

<p>RMI has huge requirements on network setup, which are not easy to comply with in most situations. This is why we want to offer a lightweight alternative written in .NET (using Remoting), so we can control its behaviour easily... </p>

<p>This project was initiated by a few Computer Science and Software Engineering students at Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá D.C., Colombia. </p>

<p>We chose the name Midas because in greek mythology he was the judge in Apollo&#39;s and Marsyas&#39; musical duel, and he was a very fair one (which earned him donkey ears in the end). It&#39;s common knowledge that he was very ambitious, and... Let&#39;s face it, everyone who enters a programming competition IS ambitious, right? </p>

<p>The aim of the project is to write the entire OS in a WEB-based programming language so that the source code may be compiled together to form a book, as well as a working operating system, making it easier for people to modify and add to than ever before. </p>

<p>Software should be free, not just as in freedom of use, but freedom to understand! </p>

<p>--- </p>

<p>The MOTHER operating system will based upon a microkernel design and take inspiration from Plan 9.  A text based interface will be used initially, however we hope that this will move to a full GUI one later.  The operating system will run on Intel&#39;s x86 processors, and be written primarily in C(WEB).</p>

 summary : <p>Novelties is a high-level declarative RPG programming language. It has a variety of features that model various aspects of an RPG game. It differs from other languages in that: </p>

<p>Novelties focuses on the high-level concepts rather then low level details. Low-level details can be specified as styles and is applied coherently cross scenes and actors. Novelties eases the development of RPG by providing a declarative and structural programming language. Novelties provides mechanisms for writing the script in various languages(as in i18n). For example, by programming appropriate header, you can write your script in pure Chinese in Novelties. Novelties is easy to learn even for people who have little programming experiences. Novelties is based on compiled JavaFX running on JVM, which provides strong support for i18n and various platforms. Novelties supports a DSL for defining maps that can be easily created and modified.  Novelties is still under heavy development and is not feature complete. Novelties is not just another programming language for RPG games. The goal for Novelties is to design and implement a programming language for RPG games that is simple, clean, and expressive(as opposed to complex, messy, and constrained). Any feature suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>We present a Hoare logic for a programming language equipped with recursive, higher-order functions, algebraic data types, and a polymorphic type system in the style of Hindley and Milner. It is the theoretical basis for a tool that extracts proof obligations out of programs annotated with logical assertions. These proof obligations, expressed in a typed, higher-order logic, are discharged using off-the-shelf automated or interactive theorem provers. Although the technical apparatus that we exploit is by now standard, its application to functional programming languages appears to be new, and (we claim) deserves attention. As a sample application, we check the partial correctness of a balanced binary search tree implementation.</p>

 summary : <p>Pointless Haskell has changed home. Please point your links at http://haskell.di.uminho.pt/wiki/Pointless+Haskell. </p>

<p>Pointless Haskell is a library for point-free programming with recursion patterns, inspired in ideas from the PolyP library. The syntax follows directly the theoretical one, with generic recursion patterns parameterized by the data type to which they should be applied. </p>

<p>It was developed as part of the PhD research by Alcino Cunha and has served as a base for the teaching of point-free programming in introductory courses to functional programming. </p>

<p>The library also features the visualization of the intermediate data structure of hylomorphisms with GHood. This feature, together with the DrHylo tool for deriving hylomorphisms from a restricted Haskell syntax, allows the easy visualization of recursion trees of Haskell functions. </p>

<p>This project reports the re-implementation of the whole library based on type-indexed type families, a recent Haskell extension provided by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. </p>

<p>A related topic is point-free program calculation for the simplification and transformation of point-free functions. The automatic simplification of point-free Haskell programs can be performed with the SimpliFree tool, or with a more recent one-level transformation system (currently under development and available from the subversion repository) based on the same type families approach and developed under the 2LT project. </p>

<p>IntroductionApplicationsNewsCitationAdditional InformationProto BugsAvoiding R Bugs </p>

<p>Introductionproto (google code name r-proto) is an R package which facilitates a style of programming known as prototype-based programming. Prototype-based programming is a type of object oriented (OO) programming in which classes and objects are unified into a single concept, prototypes.  This makes proto and prototye programming simpler than the usual OO model yet it retains the OO features of inheritance (known as delegation in the prototype model) and OO dispatch.  Applications, News, Additional Information sources, Proto Bugs and Avoiding R Bugs sections are given below while associated Links are in the Links box to the right. </p>

<p>ApplicationsThe following R packages use or are typically used with proto: </p>

<p>The R gsubfn package provides a generalization of the R function gsub for which the replacement string can be a function.  The replacement string can also be a proto object which holds the function as well as state information which can be carried from one function invocation to the next. ggplot2 is a grid based graphics package in R that uses proto internally.  (Also see this page for info on creating ggplot2 geom proto objects.) pmg is an R package that provides a GUI interface to R that uses proto internally. The gWidgets R package for user interface construction can be used in conjunction with proto as seen from the examples that contain the  word proto or scoping in this list.  Also see this r-devel post for another example of gWidgets with proto. gWidgetsWWW package is an implementation of gWidgets for the web that works with RApache on Mac and Linux (and under Windows using a virtual Linux machine). gWidgetsWWW uses proto internally. The ascii R package generates Docbook as well as output of other formats. It uses proto objects as the underlying container objects. The sqldf package allows R users to manipulate R data frames using SQL.  It uses proto internally. DescribeDisplay produces publication quality graphics from the output of the describe display plugin of GGobi. AlgoTrader is an R package that provides infrastructure for formally describing financial trading algorithms as well as facilities to test their performance.  The package allows backtesting and contains various reporting utilities. traitr is an R package for creating GUIs using the model/view/controller (MVC) paradigm. NewsMarch 12, 2010.  The Appendix of this document on AlgoTrader contains an introduction to proto that could be of interest to anyone wishing to use proto even if the Algotrader package is not applicable to their area. (This may have been there for some time but I just noticed it.) </p>

<p>March 2, 2010.  An example of a stack in proto was posted on r-help. </p>

<p>February 27, 2010.  Recently Duncan Murdoch discussed one aspect of R that he would prefer worked differently; namely, that objects were not ultimately looked up in the global environment.  If you are using proto you can emulate it.  The following are three different variations: </p>

<p>p Note the following R command which shows the R search path: </p>

<p>search()The first example starts at the second entry in the search list (which is why it omits the global environment).  The next example starts at the Stats entry in the search list and moves forward.  The last example starts right at the end of the search list thereby skipping over the rest of it and was suggested by Peter Daneberg in the same thread as appropriate in certain  circumstances. </p>

<p>Jan 18/10.  An example of using proto to work with views on matrices can be found here. </p>

<p>Jan 15/10.  Added traitr  to the list of applications above that use proto. </p>

<p>July 5/08.  Added a fifth point in the Avoiding R Bugs section. </p>

<p>May 19/08.  Added quotations to top of this page. </p>

<p>Mar 7/08.  In the development version of proto the parent argument to the proto function may now be a function in which case its environment is used as the parent.  This facilitates constructing proxy proto objects: with(proto(f, f = f, a = 1), f) wedges an anonymous proto object between f and its environment inserting a into the proxy so that it can be accessed as a free variable from within f. </p>

<p>Mar 7/08.  The method of proto proxies was illustrated in an r-devel post. </p>

<p>Feb 25/08.  A dput.proto routine was posted on r-devel. </p>

<p>Jan 26/08.  Just noticed that there was a modification to the R development source made on Jan 24, 2008, see r44139 in r-devel log, which indicates that a bug in R related to promises has been fixed.  Since proto 0.4, the current development version, depends heavily on promises this should be beneficial.  The following code, which is not dependent on proto, previously failed under R but now it works: </p>

<p># code below previously triggered errors but now works - R 2.6.2 (2008-01-26 r44181)</p>

<p>f Jan 09/08.  Added a second paragraph to the LazyLoad subsection of the Avoiding R Bugs list at the bottom based on a recent discussion on the r-devel list.  Also added a new section Proto Bugs below.  Note that all known bugs are fixed in the development version of proto. </p>

<p>Dec 07/07.  as.proto.data.frame method added to the devel version of proto.  Its just a synonym for as.proto.list. </p>

<p>as.proto.data.frame Dec 06/07.  print bug added to bug list below. </p>

<p>Dec 01/07.  Added a new argument, eval.env = parent.frame() to the proto function in the devel version of proto.  It defines the environment in which promises in the ... arguments are evaluated.  The default value of eval.env is normally what one wants; however, in the case of wrappers around proto one would generally want the calling frame of the wrapper rather than the frame which directly calls proto and this argument facilitates that. The need for this is related to the problem in R described in point #4 of Avoiding R Bugs at the end of this page. </p>

<p>Oct 28/07.  Added a reference to pmg in the Applications section above as it uses proto internally. </p>

<p>Oct 17/07.  Added a reference to this r-devel post and discussion to the LazyLoad subsection of the Avoiding R Bugs section at the end of this page.  (This applies to packages that have proto objects at top level.  Also see ReleaseNotes.txt.) </p>

<p>Sep 30/07.  A workaround for the R bug where promises in lists do not get evaluated was developed.  (This never affected the released version of proto on CRAN.)   See Avoiding R Bugs section below. </p>

<p>Sep 25/07.  Added ReleaseNotes.txt describing new features of the development version (proto 0.4-0) also found on Source tab above.  To try out, after installing from the Source Repository run this (under R 2.6.2):  </p>

They are all fixed in the development version already. </p>

<p>1. str.proto.  This will not affect most users but one user was redefining print and that caused name.proto (hence str.proto) to break.  The call to print has been replaced with a call to print.default in name.proto to avoid this in the devel version of proto.  Here are three workarounds in the meantime: Run this code: </p>

<p>name.proto or, source the new version of graph.proto.R which is the file that contains name.proto: </p>

<p>source(&quot;http://r-proto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/R/proto.R&quot;) # load changed codeor, ensure that your proto object has a ..Name component.  For example, this works even if print is redefined: </p>

<p>print 2. A proto object could not have the name x. </p>

<p>Avoiding R BugsDue to the fundamental nature of proto, it makes use of portions of R that may not be commonly accessed in other packages; therefore, it has uncovered a number of R bugs or deficencies that were not previously known or at least are less known.  Fortunately there are simple workarounds to deal with them provided you know about them.  </p>

<p>1. LazyLoad </p>

<p>If a package uses lazyloading then R will erroneously change the class of all proto objects at top level to &quot;environment&quot;.   This r-devel post from the R development team confirms that it is a bug in R and that there is an intention to fix it (however, as of  &quot;R version 2.8.0 alpha (2008-10-01 r46589)&quot; it had still not been fixed.  See this r-devel post for details and info on how to test it.)  To avoid this bug use LazyLoad: false in the DESCRIPTION file of any package that has proto objects at top level.  </p>

<p>In older versions of R it was possible to use SaveImage: true in the DESCRIPTION file; however, SaveImage is not available in recent versions of R. </p>

<p>One gotcha is that not specifying LazyLoad is not the same as LazyLoad: false.  As mentioned in R News 4/2 if LazyLoad is not specified then R will use lazy loading if there is more than 25K of R code in the package and otherwise not.  See this: r-devel discussion.   There is some information on LazyLoad and SaveImage in this r-devel post and there is an article on lazy loading in R News 4/2.  (This behavior will change in R 2.9.0 where true will be the default and the odd 25K criterion will be eliminated.) </p>

<p>One can test this by creating an R package with only two files which are (1) this DESCRIPTION file: </p>

<p>Package: testlazy
<br/>Version: 1.0-0
<br/>Date: 2008-10-03
<br/>Title: Test lazy loading
<br/>Author: G Grothendieck
<br/>Maintainer: G Grothendieck 
<br/>Description: Test lazy loading with top level objects.
<br/>Depends: proto
<br/>LazyLoad: yes
<br/>License: GPL-2and (2) this R/testlazy.R file: </p>

<p>TopLevel We test it like this: </p>

<p>library(testlazy)
<br/>class(TopLevel)If the class of TopLevel is just environment then the proto component of the class has been stripped by R. </p>

<p>One related problem is that if you use LazyLoad: false to overcome the problem above then proto will not be available during the package load unless it is specifically loaded so add: require(proto) to your code if any top level proto objects are created at load time.  See: this r-devel post and this related post . </p>

<p>2. Promises and Lists </p>

<p>R is supposed to evaluate promises that are stored in lists but, in fact, it does not -- see this thread in r-devel.  It is currently believed that this has never affected the released version of proto on CRAN nor does it affect the most recent devel version of proto.  It did affect earlier devel versions of proto.   Even though it seems to currently have no consequence  we are leaving this item here just in case it comes up in some new form and needs to be revisited.  (This may be fixed already in the R 2.9.0 development version.) </p>

<p># No longer a problem but recorded here just in case.</p>

<p># ensure proto 0.4-0 is installed from Source tab 
<br/># or just load the CRAN version of proto and over top
<br/># of it source proto.R from the repository as discussed 
<br/># in the Sep 25th News item above
<br/># 
<br/># in the code below:
<br/># - p is a proto object 
<br/># - x a child of p created by invoking p$new
<br/># - y is a copy of x formed by converting the
<br/>#   the proto object to a list and back to proto
<br/>#
<br/># The problem is that although ls(y) says that gg is in y
<br/># when we try to evaluate it, R says its not there.</p>

<p>p 3. Subclassing environments </p>

<p>Operating locally on an environment attribute changes its value globally which seems undesirable. </p>

<p>The proto class is an S3 subclass of the environment class.  Unfortunately if e is a variable holding an environment and f is a copy of it then if you set an attribute on f then e gets it too: </p>

<p>f After the above e will gain attribute abc with a value of 3 as well.  This occurs even if 3 is assigned within a function. &quot;class&quot; is an attribute so it also applies to the class.   </p>

<p>4. Limitations on Use of Promises </p>

<p>Using pure R, there is currently no way to copy promises without evaluating them nor is there any way to discover the environment associated with a promise.    For the proto clone function it would be desirable to be able to copy promises without evaluating them while preserving their environments.  Although the preceding are not possible in pure R it is possible to do this using C. </p>

<p>5. [[ Does Not Work Well with Promises </p>

<p>This is no longer a problem in R but is being left here in case it comes up again in some other form. </p>

<p>In the code below test fails.  Note that this code does not use proto and this is a general problem in R. </p>

 title : The s-ma-u-g Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Finite State Machine IdentificationIdentification has been defined as an inference process, which deduces an internal representation of the system from samples of it&#39;s functioning. There are many possibilities to a represent system, one of them is to use a finite state machine (FSM).  </p>

<p>There are many applications for identification  in different fields such as logical design, verification or test, sequential learning. For example finite automata (FA) are useful models for many important kind of hardware and software systems (lexical analysis, system for verifying the correctness). </p>

<p>The modeling problem consists of researching the &#39;best&#39;  FSM (in practice, one of those that best describe the process behavior), which respects the dynamics of the external model. Finding a minimum size deterministic FA consistent with the set of given samples is NP-complete. </p>

<p>The genetic simulation approach is an alternative that reduces the complexity of the preceding methods. </p>

<p>Our goal is to create methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), which allow to find FSM using only external behavior. </p>

<p>This project uses a methodology based on genetic algorithms for inferring finite state machines. </p>

<p>Basic parameters like fitness functions and chromosomal representation that can be used with canonical genetic algorithm were defined. Different types of finite state machines can be infered. Several improvements were introduced: inner decimal representation has been used to improve the speed of initialization stage, post-processing stage has been used to remove unaccessible states. </p>

<p>Currently this project is a part of my PhD thesis. But originally it was developed during my MSc studies.</p>

With such an interface, you can deal efficiently with huge problem (each library works with sparse matrix) and, with the Coin-Or library, you can reach the same level of performances as with a linear programming commercial tool. </p>

<p>For the CoinOR part: </p>

<p>CLP: is a C++ library dedicated to solve huge linear programs. Was before 2004 released as a commercial tool by IBM. This tool was named OSL. CBC: is a C++ library dedicated to solve huge mixed integer linear programs. IPopt: is a C++ library dedicated to solve non linear constrained optimization problems NLP). Bonmin: is a C++ library dedicated to solve non linear mixed integer constrained optimization problems (MINLP). Symphony: is a C/C++ library dedicated to solve mixed integer bicriteria linear programs. This library supports OpenMP (so it works efficiently under multicores) and PVM (and work nicely under parallel architectures). The parallel things are only supported on linux box. For windows, it&#39;s just a mater of having or not a visual express edition. The OpenMP library is not shipped with the visual express edition. </p>

<p>With the scicoinor toolbox, you can read / write easily MPS and LP files. </p>

 summary : <p>I find that it is too bother to create a pretty Java GUI program with AWT, Swing, SWT, etc. Traditional GUI programming is difficult in Java. It says, it is not hard to learn how to develop program, but too expensive maintenance a project. The widgets shown are mixed with the logic code. Once the GUI changes, the logic might have to be changed a lot. Besides, the efficiency of programming might be much low. 
<br/>So I decided to find a method which can make GUI programming easily, configurable and efficiently in Java. According to the design patten &quot;MVC&quot;, I found a way which could help us to easily setup a Java GUI program. It creates widgets automatically in term of the way shown in the configure file. The widgets are generated by SWT with the &quot;reflect&quot; technology.</p>

<p>    
<br/>      Release Notes       </p>

<p>Ariah detects that the author wants the linked resource included as inline XHTML, and that it requires conversion from Markdown format. So, Ariah downloads the file, converts it, and replaces the link with the results. If the browser cannot run Ariah, then the file remains accessible through a normal hyperlink. </p>

<p>Although Ariah implements several built-in hyperlink relationships like &quot;include&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, and &quot;template&quot;, Ariah also exposes a simple JavaScript API so Web programmers can more easily define their own custom relationships among Web pages, as well as their own client-side file format converters (called &quot;hyperformats&quot; in Ariah parlance). Ariah is the class name for the acronym of &quot;Accessible Related Includes and Ajax Hyperformats&quot;. </p>

<p>Ariah can use combinations of multiple relationships to help discern what to do with hyperlinks. For example, </p>

<p>    
<br/>      View the hf.js source code.       By adding the term source to the include relationship, the author is telling Ariah not to parse the file normally, but to show the original source text of the file. In this case, if Ariah can find a source formatter for files of type application/ecmascript, then the displayed result will use code-coloring; otherwise, Ariah will insert the source code of the script as plain text. </p>

<p>Ariah also works on head links. For example, </p>

<p>         When placed before Ariah&#39;s script element, Ariah will automatically load the &quot;client-side&quot; template file and apply it to the current Web page. Because the head section of the template will run, most recurring scripts, stylesheets, and repetitious design elements can be pruned out of each Web page and into a client-side template. Such a workflow simplifies Web design, streamlines a site&#39;s bandwidth, and usually improves accessibility. For example, the template file linked above can be an XHTML file with an empty body, but with a list of primary and alternate template links in its head section: </p>

<p>    
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>          
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    In such an arrangement, a Web browser can select a template file most appropriate to the medium and a user interface most appropriate to the user&#39;s preferred mode. Each chosen template, in turn, can link to its own primary and alternate stylesheets. </p>

<p>Sites using AriahAriah is the next generation of some of my earlier work on client-side includes (c. 1996) and hyperformats (c. 2000) which were stable, but in its current form, Ariah is not. However, interested Web developers can see one of Ariah&#39;s ancestors, hf.js &quot;in the wild&quot; on the inner pages of http://grayschoolofmusic.com . The script itself is at  http://grayschoolofmusic.com/Scripts/js2/hf.js . The Gray site demonstrates many of the features discussed about Ariah, so feel free to view the source code of its pages.  </p>

<p>Future PlansBecause Ariah uses a &quot;markup interface&quot;, the Ariah project is planning to help implement native modules for Open-Source Web browsers to accelerate performance of Web pages designed for Ariah. The native modules should be able to activate automatically whenever they detect a link to Ariah script, so acceleration can happen transparently. As a side effect, native Ariah modules may make it possible for Web browsers to cache many popular script libraries in an optimized state to be transparently reused from many Web sites. For example, </p>

<p>    A native Ariah module might detect that the techst.js script can be loaded from a cached version with a matching title URI loaded from another site, so long as the digital fingerprint of the cached version matches the hash encoded at the URL in the title field. Otherwise, the file will be downloaded normally from the current host. </p>

<p>StatusAriah is still in a mid-alpha state under heavy development, so it should not be used in production work. This alpha release has only been tested under Firefox 2.0 and Safari 1.3 on Mac OS X, so it is likely to break other browsers until it goes through the crucible.  </p>

<p>Ariah is a symbiotic rewrite of some of my earlier code that was stable under the two latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, each on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, where available. I won&#39;t promote Ariah to beta status until it passes tests under each of those clients and platforms. </p>

<p>Ariah&#39;s alpha download bundles several test scripts that help demonstrate the features described here, with the exception of those described under the &quot;future plans&quot; heading. Several of these scripts are more interesting than Ariah itself, but available nowhere else. See the download&#39;s readme and script documentation for more details. </p>

 title : The cidades-estados-js Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UpdateSaiu do forno a nova versão 1.0 estável na qual não é mais preciso criar selects obstrusivos. Agora você pode implementar o cidades-estados-js em inputs (type text) ou qualquer outra tag. Veja a implementação do script funcionando. </p>

<p>GeralA intenção deste projeto é colocar sempre em um único lugar um arquivo javascript que pode ser utilizado em qualquer site para criar duas combo-box (em html, select) com escolha de estados e cidades. </p>

<p>Decidi hospedá-lo no servidor do google porque assim é mais improvável que hajam problemas de servidor em qualquer servidor que eu hospede. Para instalá-lo em seu site, coloque a seguinte instrução entre suas tags head. </p>

<p>Feito isso, a biblioteca está instalada em seu site. O legal é que todos os sites que usarem esta biblioteca usarão o mesmo provedor/servidor. Gravando no cache do usuário o mesmo arquivo, sendo assim, carregado mais rapidamente na próxima vez que o usuário acessar qualquer outro site que tenha referencia para o mesmo arquivo. </p>

<p>Para ativar a biblioteca você pode utilizar os próprios métodos do javascript ou o dgDomReady da biblioteca ou mesmo qualquer biblioteca como prototype, mootools ou jQuery. </p>

<p>A forma mais simples de ativar a biblioteca é esta, usando o objeto dgCidadesEstados passando os objetos que serão serão usados como select de estados e cidades. Veja um exemplo: </p>

<p>window.onload = function() {
<br/>  new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>    estado: document.getElementById(&#39;estado&#39;),
<br/>    cidade: document.getElementById(&#39;cidade&#39;)
<br/>  });
<br/>}
<br/>dgDomReadydgDomReady é um evento auxiliar que executa uma determinada função quando o objeto DOM é carregado. A diferença básica entre window.onload e dgDomReady é que o window.load é executado quando a página é carregada por completo, com as imagens em anexo e os arquivos flash. Já o dgDomReady é executado quando apenas o arquivo html é carregado, sendo assim, mais rápida a execução do que no outro caso. O exemploanterior ficaria assim: </p>

<p>window.onDomReady(function() {
<br/>  new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>    estado: document.getElementById(&#39;estado&#39;),
<br/>    cidade: document.getElementById(&#39;cidade&#39;)
<br/>  });
<br/>});
<br/>Aplicações usando sua biblioteca preferidaEm jQuery, o mesmo exemplo poderia ser explicado por: </p>

<p>$(function() {
<br/>  new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>    estado: $(&#39;#estado&#39;).get(0),
<br/>    cidade: $(&#39;#cidade&#39;).get(0)
<br/>  });
<br/>});
<br/>Prototype: </p>

<p>Event.observe(window, &#39;load&#39;, function() {
<br/>  new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>    estado: $(&#39;estado&#39;),
<br/>    cidade: $(&#39;cidade&#39;)
<br/>  });
<br/>});
<br/>Recuperando os dadosPara fazer o sistema recuperar uma informação dada anteriormente, basta passar os parâmetros estadoValue e cidadeValue dentro do construtor. </p>

<p>new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>  cidade: document.getElementById(&#39;cidade2&#39;),
<br/>  estado: document.getElementById(&#39;estado2&#39;),
<br/>  estadoVal: &#39;SP&#39;,
<br/>  cidadeVal: &#39;São Paulo&#39;
<br/>});Ou então passando como atributo value em sua tag select (ou input como descrito mais abaixo). </p>

<p>new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>  cidade: document.getElementById(&#39;cidade1&#39;),
<br/>  estado: document.getElementById(&#39;estado1&#39;)
<br/>});Obstrusividade?! Não!Não é preciso que você escreva uma tag select, você pode executar usando um input que será substituido pelo select necessário. Para ativar esta opção, basta passar o parâmetro change. </p>

<p>new dgCidadesEstados({
<br/>  cidade: document.getElementById(&#39;cidade3&#39;),
<br/>  estado: document.getElementById(&#39;estado3&#39;),
<br/>  change: true
<br/>});Charset?!Você não precisa se preocupar em codificação de caracteres, o cidades-estados-js é disponibilizado nas versões Latin (ANSII) e UTF-8. Para isso, basta alterar a forma como você chama a biblioteca. </p>

<p>Dê preferencia a usar o charset utf-8, mas se seu sistema não aceitar essa codificação ou você usa DreamWeaver e nem sabe o que é isso, provavelmente você vai precisar da versão em ASCII. ;D </p>

<p>Nota: Vale a pena ler o artigo sobre intercacionalização de caracteres da w3c que explica mais sobre codificação, inclusive o utf-8. </p>

<p>updateNa versão 0.2 podemos pedir para o plugin inseir os valores de estados quando carregar o plugin. Para isto, basta inserir um terceiro parâmetro (true) na criação do objeto. </p>

<p>Usando como base a função cifrão ($) como: </p>

<p>function $(elm){
<br/>  return document.getElementById(elm);
<br/>}Chamamos a função de inicialização assim. Onde o true indica que queremos que sejam preenchidos os estados automaticamente. </p>

<p>new dgCidadesEstados($(&#39;estado&#39;), $(&#39;cidade&#39;), true);todoAutomatizar o estado e cidade. Assim a cidade e o estado aparecerão já marcados com um único comando. </p>

<p>Criar os devidos elementos, assim pode-se criar a partir de inputs text para gerar os selects dinamicamente, acabando com o problema de javascript desabilitado. </p>

<p>Implementar plugin para Dreamweaver.</p>

 title : The erlyjs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ErlyJS is a Javascript compiler running on and compiling for the Erlang virtual machine. </p>

<p>Motivation:Short answer: For highly scalable and lightning fast serverside Javascript. Long answer:  The ultimate goal is to simplify the process of building Ajax and Comet Web applications. ErlyJS should help to achieve this by allowing the same programming language for server and client side. There is not much choice for that programming language, Javascript is the only one running natively in web browsers. To run Javascript at serverside there are existing solutions (Rhino, Spidermonkey) but for better horizontal scalability, performance, fault tolerance and ease of deployment, the multi-core and high-concurrency Erlang virtual machine has been chosen and a Javascript compiler had to be developed from scratch. ErlyJS should provide full interoperability with Erlang, so web frameworks and Web / Application servers written in Erlang can be used. Implementation details:Leex/Yecc based grammar Compiler generates byte code for the Erlang VM Option: recompilation only if source has changed (compiled Javascript modules store source checksum) Compatibility:Javascript version: 1.5 Spidermonkey/Rhino: global function load  Project status:Pre-alpha. Right now a major refactoring is taking place to move the code base from erl_syntax based approach to Core Erlang. The code in SVN trunk is out of date, git is used now and repo URLs will be announced here once the refactoring to Erlang Core is complete  </p>

<p>ToDo:Add all the missing stuff to provide full Javascript support, comparable to Spidermonkey and Rhino Implement native serverside Browser DOM support  Implement AST parse transformations for: pretty-printing Javascript source code safely shrinking Javascript source code refactoring Javascript source code Implement API for Javascript debugging, profiling and code analysis Wanna contribute ?You are familiar with Erlang, Javascript, Lambda Calculus, Parsers and Lexers: you are the most wanted ! You know Javascript, but not Erlang: write Javascript tests</p>

Defining your build process in a scripting language has the obvious (and semi-tautological) advantage over XML of scriptability. </p>

<p>Formicid leverages the existing tasks and framework of Ant for the actual build processing, while adding the ability to easily add custom tasks and behavior to your build process.</p>

<br/>      May 21, 2005
<br/>      (2 hours)
<br/>    
<br/>  will render as plain text that is legible by humans reading your page, and is at the same time completely machine-parsable.  hCalendar uses the concepts of iCalendar (the data format behind Apple&#39;s iCal, among other things), but allows &#39;events&#39; to be embedded in ordinary HTML pages using standard HTML tags. </p>

<p>js-hcalendarjs-hcalendar is a simple JavaScript program which, when included in a webpage, searches it for hCalendar events and builds a table-based visual calendar. It then inserts that calendar into a  that you put in your page. You should then style it with your choice of CSS; I&#39;ve created calendar.css and minicalendar.css as examples. </p>

<p>It is  very simplistic: it  entirely ignores everything but  the start date and the summary of the event; it doesn&#39;t even deal with the start time. But it is easily extendable. </p>

<p>(js-hcalendar was once known as JSCalendar, but that name overlaps with another excellent and unrelated project.) </p>

<p>DemosYou can look at a simple demo of a few random events. Note the links to switch between the two style sheets, if your browser does not support style-sheet switching. Or try a list of holidays from one of the first hCalendar sites, http://suda.co.uk/projects/holidays/, with JSCalendar injected.</p>

 title : The jscombiner Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Notice: The download archive is old, please get sourcecode from svn and build it yourself with a simple maven command </p>

<p>mvn installor wait for the next stable version. It would not be long. Thank you. </p>

<p>This project is evolving and more interesting. </p>

<p>The Jscombiner (JavaScript Combiner) is a helper tool which will help you to manage your javascripts.  </p>

<p>Imagine this case. You got a javascript project directory like this: </p>

<p>web_app
<br/>|    index.jsp
<br/>|
<br/>\---scripts
<br/>    |   config.js
<br/>    |   app.js
<br/>    |
<br/>    \---pkg
<br/>            a.js
<br/>            b.jsHere the config.js is a optional file which provide configuration information. app.js is kind of main application script. </p>

<p>Inside app.js: </p>

<p>/**
<br/> * @import pkg.*
<br/> */
<br/>// any code herepkg/a.js and pkg/b.js are some kind of functions or classes scripts. </p>

<p>Then, what do you expect in the index.jsp? </p>

<p>...And what about adding a pkg/c.js? You can update index.jsp by hand. </p>

<p>But what about you got dozens of scripts, dozens of applications and you have to update one or two of them in the complicate hierarchy? </p>

<p>To avoid this issue, many developer keep a small volume but long scripts. But this is not good to manage your code and collaborate. </p>

<p>Jscombiner will help you get through of this. See the @import in app.js comment. All you should do is adding dependencies description. Then, let Jscombiner do the rest using a tag-lib: </p>

<p>...Also, Jscombiner has a command line tool to combiner your scripts into a big script. </p>

<p>Jscombiner is so beta, examples and docs are on the road. But if you are eager, just let me know via leegorousatgmail.com or raise an issue. </p>

<p>Saving your time is saving the world. </p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>Below is the old description, it works all the time. </p>

<p>Managing javascripts is not a nice job and it will get worse as your scripts grow quickly. JSC (JavaScriptCombiner) comes to set you free on it. </p>

<p>You can organise your scripts as you want, write down the configuration and let JSC do the rest. </p>

<p>JSC can assemble your scripts into one js file, generate an agent page and testCase pages (JsUnit test page) according as the configuration file. </p>

<p>JSC is developed in Java. </p>

<p>在开发JavaScript项目中，管理js是一个比较令人头疼的问题，特别是当项目快速发展，脚本越来越长，越来越多时，增删修改在所难免时，管理问题凸显。 </p>

<p>为此制作这个小工具来让我们可以以所希望的粒度来分布和组织脚本文件，但又不会使得管理他们成为一种负担。 </p>

<p>设想我们有很多脚本，这些脚本有些可以独立成模块的，但有些则不好独立，但是在管理上，做好功能区分是更加有利的，于是开始拆分这些脚本为单独的脚本。又或者我们希望脚本是以类（跟Java的类概念相近，但是是prototype型的）为单元的，那么将一个类独立成一个文件管理起来会更加方便。拆分成大量的独立脚本之后，又如何组织起来呢？按照最基本的办法，就是写大量的脚本引用标记，又或者像某些脚本导入框架所使用的方法一样进行动态导入。然而问题是当脚本数量比较多时，手动进行比较费事失事，客户端需要装载大量小脚本，而且脚本是顺序执行的，也就是说有依赖关系的，搞清关系这个本身也比较麻烦。这个就是JavaScriptCombiner（简称jscombiner，或者JSC）的最初的开发目的。 </p>

<p>JSC最基本的功能就是安装配置文件，读取脚本，组织好其依赖关系之后，合并成一个大脚本（未压缩）。而JSC怎么知道应该如何去处理那些关系呢？答案是脚本需要提供其依赖信息，例如加入形如下面的注释： </p>

<p>/**
<br/> * @import net.leegorous.jsc.*;
<br/> */但是可以预见的是，每次修改脚本都需要重新组装一次脚本，这个有点不好，于是为其增加一种模式，agent模式，专门用于调试的。其原理就是生成一个agent页面，读取并组织好关系后不是将脚本写入agent页面，而是将每个脚本相对于agent页面的引用标记写入。外部页面以一个iframe包含（其实也可以不包含而直接使用）agent页，这样在脚本发生修改之后就不需要重新合成，因为每一次装载都是直接调用小脚本本身，这在（本地）调试时几乎看不出有影响。 </p>

<p>再就是测试脚本的需求，JSC提供了对Edward Hieatt开发的JsUnit的支持。使用者只需要像JUnit一样为testCase建立一个脚本，脚本里面包含所需要的依赖信息，在配置文件里面需要指明jsUnitCore.js所在的目录并且指明testCases所在的位置，JSC就能够为每个testCase脚本生成可以在JsUnit中运行的测试页。 </p>

<p>JSC的功能目前还比较简单，但是在实际使用过程当中，觉得它真的可以节省不少劳动时间，于是拿出来大家分享一下。:P</p>

 summary : <p>jsmud - JavaScript MUD KernelAbout jsmudThe JavaScript MUD Kernel is software which allows developers to build a fully working MUD server utilizing the JavaScript scripting language. The project does not provide a ready-to-run MUD system, but instead requires that developers implement their own MUD from scratch. All that jsmud provides is the necessary networking, timer, and data storage APIs to the JavaScript environment. </p>

<p>The jsmud project was originally written as a proof-of-concept in the course of two days by Sean Middleditch of Mojodo, Inc.  Several more days of effort have been put in since then.  There is much left to do before jsmud is ready for prime time. </p>

<p>jsmud does not run inside of a web browser!  jsmud embeds the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine inside of a conventional server process.  It has nothing to do with web browsers, HTML, or client-side JavaScript application development. </p>

<p>InstallationThere is no installation required for jsmud. Simply unpack the jsmud-0.5.tgz tarball and run make: </p>

<p>tar -zxf jsmud-0.5.tgz
<br/>cd jsmud-0.5
<br/>makeThe file named README has information on development using jsmud. </p>

 title : The mindforth Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TheoryBrainTheory is the design basis of MindForth artificial intelligence. The CognitiveArchitecture is carefully designed to permit expansion of the fundamental AiEngine into special-purpose AI applications and novel pathways of AiEvolution.  </p>

<p>SoftwareEach OpenSource MindModule is documented with a wiki-page tightly integrated with forty-plus other pages about other modules. ForthMindTextFile is the actual source code of the artificial Mind. PortingOfCode from iForth, Win32Forth or JavaScript into other programming languages is an option for AiCoders, who should not seek to join the IndependentScholar GC/MF project but should rather start their own AI project or join a preexisting project. MindForth has migrated upwards from 32-bit Win32Forth under MS-DOS to  64-bit iForth running on 64-bit Linux machines. To participate in 64-bit MindForth, AI coders should  obtain iForth and adapt the ForthMindTextFile for running on 64-bit Linux machines.  </p>

<p>CensorshipThe illegitimate government of China is not democratically elected. We are proud of Google for refusing to censor topics like &quot;Tienanmen Square Massacre&quot; in China. </p>

<p>RobotsMindForth is designed for EmBodiment in a RoBot.  </p>

<p>SingularityThe phenomenon of man has been a bad experience for PlanetEarth. GlobalWarming has now become unstoppable. As HomoSapiens rushes to ruin the planet, RoboSapiens emerges as a successor species with the ImMortality that needs a safe environment and with the SuperIntelligence necessary to safeguard SpaceshipEarth. The ChangeLog of MindForth is peppered with MileStones on the RoadMap to TechnologicalSingularity.</p>

<p>If you just want to play, add http://hansschmucker.googlepages.com/patienceig.xml to google.com/ig or point your browser to http://gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://hansschmucker.googlepages.com/patienceig.xml</p>
 title : The php-javascript-css-aggregator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project does 2 major things: 1. It makes sure you include every css and js only once in every page you generate. This is very helpful when using templating, since you want to attach the template css to the template, but if you reuse the template the css will be called several times, not necessarily causing any damage, but there is a slight performance hit, and problems in firebug (and we don&#39;t want that!) 2. If you set $GENERAL_CONFIG&#39;aggregate&#39; = true, then this code starts aggregating the css and js files into one large file. This helps decrease calls to http, really boosting up your site&#39;s performance. </p>

<p>USAGE: 1. Create the cache table (see notices) 2. Create the code accessing the cache table, basically this is a class supporting the functions $db-&gt;GetCacheInfo, $db-&gt;SetCacheInfo, and $db-&gt;CreateCacheInfo. 3. require js_css_aggregator in your code, and either call js_include_once(), or css_include_once() as necessary. 4. to output the cache into your html, the code provides the global variables $all_js and $all_css, which you just echo in your html. To provide the best performace for your site, echo $all_css at the top of your html, and echo $all_js at the bottom of your html. </p>

<p>NOTICES: 1. To use the aggregator you need the following db table: CREATE TABLE cache ( </p>

<p>id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, 
<br/>cache_name varchar(100) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL, 
<br/>cache_content text collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL, 
<br/>version varchar(100) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL, 
<br/>last_update datetime NOT NULL, 
<br/>last_update_unix bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL default &#39;0&#39;, 
<br/>PRIMARY KEY  (id), 
<br/>UNIQUE KEY cache_name (cache_name) 
<br/>) I didn&#39;t add the database code to the project yet because it is too customized for the project I wrote the aggregator for. So this google code is for php programmers not afraid to hack and customize code to fit their own projects. I am hoping that in the near future I will have a quiet weekend to turn this code into a closed component. 2. The code currently creates a different cache per page, but that is easily modifiable.  3. There is different code producing the js and css includes, but they are virtually identical, I will probably pretty up this code when I have the time. </p>

<p>WISHLIST: 1. Wrap this code in a normal class to get rid of the horrible global variables. 2. Split the parameter $GENERAL_CONFIG&#39;aggregate&#39; into $GENERAL_CONFIG&#39;js-aggregate&#39; and $GENERAL_CONFIG&#39;css-aggregate&#39;, so people can choose whether they want to aggregate js or css only. 3. Add the database code to the class so people don&#39;t have to write it themselves. 4. That someone would either volunteer to help me with this, or that someone will take this and rewrite it into something more useful for the community :)</p>

<p> No real physical server facilities are required. All the basic services required by an online game are provided by Google services. 2. Game content and static data are stored in Google Page server. 
<br/>3. Game runtime data are stored in Google Base server. 
<br/>4. User accounts are managed by Google Talk (GMail) server. Only friends can join a game. 
<br/>5. The game content is easy customized by users. </p>

<p>Planning features in the future if possible: </p>

<p> User can go through game groups by trust mechanism. For example, in a RPG game, a user go through game groups just like from one country go to another country. 2. The game list can be embedded in the Google Talk Client. </p>

<p>There is a test page which proved the technical possibility on my Google Page http://kctan.tw.googlepages.com/TestChatClient.htm. It is modified from a simple flash example: Animation. User can move the “tofu” object by the cursor then broadcast the new position to all other clients by Google Talk. All the other clients can see the real-time moving effect of the “tofu”. There are the requirements: </p>

<p> IE 6.0 (only tested in this browser) 2. Flash Player 8.0 
<br/>3. JRE 6 
<br/>4. A Googl Talk (GMail) account 
<br/>It uses java applet including smack to commutate between flash and Google Talk Server. Be careful that it will broadcast the messages to all the clients on your Google Talk client users for now.</p>

 title : The lost-cities-game Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is my Java implementation of the fantastic 2-player card game called &quot;Lost Cities&quot;, invented by the prolific German game designer Reiner Knizia. At the moment, you can only play against the computer (and a pretty weak game it plays too). Future enhancements may include human-human games, a player ladder, and a high score table. </p>

<p>I wrote this game in early 2001 in order to learn Java, with a view to becoming a professional software developer. Although it succeeded at that, looking back at the code with the benefit of seven years&#39; commercial Java experience makes me shudder and cringe. There are a lot of things I&#39;d like to refactor, such as: </p>

<p>converting the reference data from int constants to Java 5 enums abstracting the AI out of the rest of the code to make it pluggable properly separating the domain logic (e.g. game rules) from the GUI code </p>

<p>The program deliberately uses some of the newer features of Java (e.g. Swing). So in order to run it as an applet, you may need to download an appropriate Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Sun&#39;s web site. This will be a one-off process. If a new enough JRE is already installed, the game will start up straight away. </p>

<p>The game has a Help menu that explains both the rules of the game and how the program works.  </p>

<p>If you discover any bugs or have any suggestions on how the program or the computer&#39;s play could be improved, please email me at andrew dot i dot swan at gmail dot com. </p>

<p>Lost Cities is a game of very simple rules but fascinating depth - enjoy!</p>

<p>Hugsunin er sú að það sé hægt að &quot;plögga inn&quot; nýjum leikjum með því að skrifa dll-a sem innihalda lógíkina fyrir nýjan leik, en alltaf sé um að ræða sama kjarnann fyrir biðlarann og miðlarann, óháð því hvaða leiki er verið að bjóða upp á. </p>

<p>Þar sem verkefnið er notað í áfanga sem kennir C++ er verkefnið skrifað í því forritunarmáli. Þegar til lengri tíma er litið má reikna með að leikjabiðlarar verði fáanlegir fyrir öll helstu stýrikerfin, en í upphafi verður einblínt á að útfæra biðlara fyrir Windows.</p>

 summary : <p>I love the good old RPGs like Ultima, DDD (german RPG from the 80&#39;s) or Angband. </p>

<p>The target is a fairly complex item, skill and NPC model that is loosly based on DSA (again a german system) and D&amp;D. </p>

<p>Another goal is to create a small world with few NPCs but the possibility to load quests. This way I can offer a free game and charge you for quests (hey, just joking). </p>

<p>One great motivation is OOTS. I LOVE OOTS. It&#39;s great. You have to read it before you play the game, otherwise your character dies instantly! </p>

<p>The game is implemented under Windows using wxWidgets. I have my reasons.</p>
