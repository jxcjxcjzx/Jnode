 title : The frolog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Frolog is a MUD. In computer gaming, a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon, Domain or Dimension) is a multi-player computer game that combines elements of role-playing games and social chat rooms. The game is usually text-driven, where players read descriptions of rooms, objects, events, other characters, and computer-controlled creatures or non-player characters (NPCs) in a virtual world. Players usually interact with each other and the surroundings by typing commands that resemble a natural language, usually English. Modern commercial variants include graphics-based massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such as World of Warcraft, as well as social avatar virtual worlds such as Second Life. </p>

<p>But Frolog also is a dialogue system based on current technology from computational linguistics, artificial intelligence planning and theorem proving. </p>

<p>The issue though is that a forum is not quite adapted to handle some caracteristics of role-playing such as:  - Separation between player and character - Handling many characters for a player, sharing characters between players - preventing abuses like the ability for a character to be at two different places at the same time - Handling stories in quest mode or by location, etc </p>

 title : The perspectiveproject Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to our game. Thanks for your help and support!The setting is the Earth&#39;s alien interaction restricted area. It is the year 2050. Five races struggle to come to terms with each other and to explore the stars. Humans and four other aliens must learn to work together to help each get what it wants from the others. The humans hope to go to the stars! </p>

<p>This is a game that is out to explore the boundaries of MMORPG design and artwork. We fully understand that some of these ideas my not be possible with current computers but that games of this type often take many years to reach release stage and that by that time computers will be much faster and the software much stronger making many ideas possible. </p>

<p>Our game is unique because: </p>

<p>We promote Role playing and acting in every way we can. The game seeks to be biologically and scientifically accurate at least when it is fun. It is hard science fiction. It has “Puppet technology” controlled toons or characters. You can make your character cry or laugh while walking and singing. We want to promote ACTING and learning not killing. Player get “charisma or good play votes” that they can give to other players. At the end of the month the top 10% of the players get some sort of bonus and also get political points that can be used to run for higher online offices in the game. This will encourage players to help each other and to form strong groups. Leadership and niceness has its rewards. It has a full Gaia ecosystem with DNA and NPC reproduce and have sex and other bodily functions. Everything has to eat, drink, sleep, excrete and have the right environment for it to excel. It has five main races that are all interconnected. Each race has a very distinctive social rule system, style and city type and environment. Each one excels at some type of basic skill.  Each race needs the other in some way. Players can make things off line with Blender 3d or some other editor and add them to the world and are encouraged to do so! They can invent new weapons, make a house, clothing, or they can make a new kind of animal. They can sell these things in character to make money online or get big money or cool things from a NPC for the animals. They can buy land outside the cities and make their own communities.  Making good NPC bots is rewarded as is making good player bots. It has unlimited skill levels that are not restricted within a race. High level player loose low level skill and thus need low level player to advance and produce things. Skill levels are increased by getting a book that can be read and must be read to use skills, this teaches real world information and they give quests to help perfect skills. It has Technology Levels that increase on a daily basis. Players can vote and they can set up votes for any group or subgroup of characters. It has a full economy with an exciting auction system. Players can play ANYTHING in the world even a carnivorous tree if they like. It has world physics so if you roll a rock into a house the house falls down. Fully interactive environment. (Yep, big wish, maybe in 10 years?) It has scripting with AI that lets players play when they are not at the computer if they write a good script. Scripts have a private life and then are made public. Client computers are used to run NPC in the background of their game playing. Servers can be anywhere with the main server used only to coordinate all the others and to keep track of where things are. And more! Yes, this is a big and challenging project! Together we will make it happen!Douglas E KnappPS The join button on the right does not work!

<p>It was brought back to life for consideration for use in the Kohana PHP framework for helping users keep up with Kohana&#39;s rapid development cycle. With a DAM provided, API changes in major releases could easily be applied to existing code to simplify the upgrade process. Also, given frequent DAM updates, trunk watchers could easily test their code with the latest API changes and more readily provide the development teams with useful feedback. </p>

 summary : <p>This consists of two Python command-line scripts: </p>

<p>fetch-dilbert downloads individual Dilbert comic strips </p>

<p>update-dilbert helps you maintain a private Dilbert collection </p>

<p>Both can be run on Python 2.5 on any supported platform, with the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module.  Windows EXE versions of the scripts are also available that do not require Python to be installed. </p>

<p>DisclaimerThese scripts are automated scripts that will scrape various pages from dilbert.com.  This is a violation of their terms of use.  Your use of these scripts is at your own risk.  By downloading or using these scripts, you agree to not hold Scott Wallace (me) liable for any action taken against you due to your use or download of them. </p>

<p>RequirementsIf you&#39;re using the EXE version on Windows, you don&#39;t need to install these.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll need to install these if you haven&#39;t already: </p>

<p>Python 2.5 Python Imaging Library (PIL) You can install these on Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros with: $ sudo apt-get install python python-imaging </p>

<p>fetch-dilbertThis script is capable of downloading Dilbert strips for a given day or days, or a whole year at a time. </p>

<p>UsageSyntax (for geeks):  fetch-dilbert (options) [--output=|-o OUTPATH] </p>

<p>The script takes two arguments.  One tells it which strip(s) to download, and the other tells it where to put them.  As of 2008-06-27, the order of the arguments does not matter. </p>

<p>The only required argument is one of the following: </p>

<p>--date=DATE1[,DATE2[,...]] or --dates=DATE1[,DATE2[,...]] or -d DATE1[,DATE2[,...]] Download one or more strips.  Each DATE can be either in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2008-06-24) or the word today (which tells it to download today&#39;s strip), and they are separated by commas. 
<br/>--year=YEAR or -y YEAR Downloads all strips for the year YEAR. 
<br/>--help or -h Shows a help message. 
<br/>The other argument is optional, and it is the folder where you want the strip(s) to be saved. </p>

<p>Examplesfetch-dilbert --dates=today,2008-06-23 Downloads today&#39;s strip and the one from June 23, 2008, and saves them to the current working directory.

It will download all strips that have been published during the current year that you don&#39;t already have.  Run daily after midnight Pacific time for best results. </p>

<p>UsageSyntax (for geeks):  update-dilbert [--help | -h] [-v | --verbose] [-p |--path=(path to collection)] </p>

<p>Run update-dilbert -p (path to collection) where (path to collection) is where you keep your Dilberts and it will do the dirty work for you.  If you leave out (path to collection), it will look in the current directory.  (path to collection) should have one folder for each year of Dilberts that you have (e.g. 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, ...). </p>

<p>If you want it to tell you what it&#39;s doing, run update-dilbert -v (path to collection).  update-dilbert -h will show a help message. </p>

 title : The fluid-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I always dreamed of composing applications from collaborating independent parts. That&#39;s what I think object-oriented programming was supposed to be about. </p>

<p>These libraries are my ongoing effort to achieve that dream. </p>

<p>NOTE: This is a work in progress hence no release versions or downloads are available yet and some APIs are likely to change. </p>

<p>NOTE: Documentation is forthcoming. </p>

<p>NOTE: You need Maven 2.0.9+ to build or (conveniently) use these libraries. </p>

<p>Getting the CodeThe sources for these libraries can be checked out like so: </p>

<p>$ svn checkout http://fluid-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk fluid-toolsBuilding the LibrariesOne of the essential Maven plugins in this project makes use of a feature in Apache BCEL that is available from version 5.3, namely Java 5 annotation support. Before you can build these libraries, you will need to check out the BCEL trunk and build it yourself: </p>

<p>$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/bcel/trunk bcel
<br/>$ (cd bcel; mvn install)From then on, you use Maven to build these libraries: </p>

<p>$ cd fluid-tools
<br/>$ mvn installDoing that for the first time will take a while as Maven downloads and caches in your file system the various libraries needed to run Maven and to compile Fluid Tools. </p>

<p>As Fluid Tools evolves, there may sometimes be a need to do a clean build. In fact, it is safe to do that every time you update your working copy. To get a clean build, you simply do </p>

<p>$ mvn clean installHowever, a pedantic clean build consists of first clearing the cached libraries from your local Maven repository: </p>

<p>$ cd $HOME/.m2/repository
<br/>$ rm -rf org/fluidityNOTE: the commands above assume you are working on a Unix system. Windows users will need to figure out how to achieve the same effects in their individual development enviroment. </p>

<p>TODO: </p>

<p>Deployment modules Move all deploy* classes to the deployment modules Deployer application in executable .war inside package Control centre discovery protocol Heartbeat protocol Service announcement protocol Service activation protocol Monitoring extension API (client) Management extension API (server) Find ways to make modules self-documenting both for human readers and for automated dependency resolution See how to make the build fail when not all dependencies can be resolved from the modules packaged into the application ...</p>

 summary : <p>Why Hermes? Hermes, or Mercury as the Romans later knew him, was the Greek god of commerce, language and measurement, and the protector of merchants and travelers. He is associated with alchemy, including the ability to turn lead into gold. Light-footed and lighthearted, Hermes was also ingenious, a clever inventor and a shrewd negotiator.  </p>

<p>As the swift messenger of the gods, Hermes is famed for crossing boundaries and enabling communication and cross-cultural understanding. It’s no surprise then that Hermes is the perfect emblem for this project. Skilled, agile and entrepreneurial, Hermes is the spirit of blogospher and the sign of the times.  </p>

<p>The Hermes Reader will be a web based application that will allow the administrator to configure a set of RSS/ATOM feeds as the source of information to be displayed on the site.  Much like other feed aggregators, with a twist, the post will be displayed in publication order for all feed sources, the tag/categories will filter across all source feeds, and selecting a date will display items from all feeds for that date.  It will also offer the ability to filter by a specific feed, the more traditional aggregator view. </p>

 summary : <p>This application is currently Pre-Alpha </p>

<p>Note that all components will use Datameister, as their database backend, so they can use either a database or an XML for data storage. When it is done it will consist of three main components: Authmeister. This is an authentication system. Implements password salting for added security. Unlike the one in pear, you must specify a data source, and then call the relevant function yourself, rather than just choosing your form. I feel this gives more flexibility. Datameister. A layer over MDB2 and the XML DOM that allows you to use either for data storage. Allows you to essentially query XML data, albeit data that would also be suitable for storage in a table-based database, which is fine for web apps anyway! Formmeister. A system that automatically generate forms that can generate web forms in any colour schemes and layouts. Should provide simple client side validation etc. Will return a dict from the form, rather than you having to manually get information from &quot;post&quot;. Will let you make custom forms, or automatically generate them from a datameister model style dict. Webmeister. A website building tool. After authmeister and datameister are complete, this will be the focus of the project: there won&#39;t be many further improvements to those two. For content it can link to external websites, use special plugin modules (which are the main point of the tool) or it can include the output of another file (php include basically!) It is intended to use a plugin interface that is as simple as possible. Templating for both it, and its modules should be basically as easy as handcoding a normal website. As of version 0.5, the first major milestone, the project will include the following modules: Blogmeister - A tool for writing your own blog. Pagemeister - A tool for making simple web pages. </p>

 title : The pagecache-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introductionpdb-tools is a set of command line python scripts that manipulate wwPDB macromolecule structure files.  There are many programs, both open source and proprietary, that perform similar tasks; however, most of these tools are buried within programs of larger functionality.  Thus, relatively simple calculations often involve learning a new program, compiling modules, and installing libraries. To fill a niche (and get the tasks done that I needed done), I started writing my own toolset.  This has evolved into the pdb-tools suite.  The suite of programs is characterized by the following philosophy: </p>

<p>Each program should run as a stand-alone application with a standard, GNU/POSIX style command line interface. Each program should be written in such a way to allow it to be used as a library of functions for more complex programs. Programs should require a minimum of external dependencies. Most of the scripts will run &quot;out of the box&quot; using a python interpreter.  The command line parser is designed to be flexible.  It will take an arbitrarily long list of pdb files, pdb ids, text files with pdb ids, or some mixture of all three.  If the pdb file or id is not in the working directory, scripts will attempt to download the pdb file from RCSB.  Depending on the type of operation being done, a program will either write output files in the working directory or will print to stdout.  All structure outputs are written in standard pdb format.  All data outputs are in fixed-width column format.  They were designed to be read by the statistics package R; however, they should be easily parsed by other graphing programs. </p>

<p>Note: These scripts are only compatible with Python version 2.4 and above. </p>

<p>Current functionsStructure-based calculationsGeometrycalculate protein center of mass: pdb_centermass.py calculate distance distributions: pdb_dist-filter.py,  pdb_ion_dist.py calculate backbone torsion angles: pdb_torsion.py calculate secondary structure content: pdb_dssp.py(requires DSSP) calculate atom-by-atom solvent accessibility pdb_sasa.py(requires NACCESS) find disulfide bonds based on distance: pdb_disfulfide.py find residues that touch: pdb_contact.py, pdb_water-contact.py find number of atoms neighboring another: pdb_neighbors.py Energy calculationcalculate coulomb energy: pdb_coulomb.py calculate the dipole moment of the protein: pdb_moment.py calculate pKa of ionizable groups using the Solvent-Accessibility-modified Tanford-Kirkwood method pdb_satk.py (requires fortran compiler)  Structure propertiesextract structure experiment properties: pdb_exper.py extract protein sequence from structure: pdb_seq.py calculate theoretical pI, MW, fraction titratable residues, charge: pdb_param.py File/structure manipulationadd polar hydrogens: pdb_addH.py (requires CHARMM) add missing heavy atoms, remove alternate conformations, etc.: pdb_clean.py (requires CHARMM) mutate a residue: pdb_mutator.py (requires CHARMM) renumber atoms: pdb_atom-renumber.py renumber residues: pdb_residue-renumber.py offset all residues by a fixed amount: pdb_offset.py center protein in xyz space: pdb_centermass.py places the asymmetric unit inside the unit cell: pdb_centerasu.py take subset of residues from file: pdb_subset.py split an NMR ensemble structure into individual files: pdb_splitnmr.py take a set of pdb files and create an individual directory for each one: pdb_pdb2dir.py load data into the b-factor column: pdb_bfactor.py Some of the programs are written as interfaces to other programs: CHARMM, DSSP and NACCESS, which must be downloaded and installed separately if their functions are desired.  To use pdb_satk.py, a set of fortran packages must be compiled. </p>

 title : The search-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main goal of Search Tools is to facilitate and promote the adoption of the WARC file format for storing web archives by the mainstream web development community by providing an open source software library, a set of command line tools, web server plug-ins and technical documentation for full-text and metadata search of web archive files, or WARC files. </p>

<p>The project is lead by Hanzo Archives. </p>

<p>The mailing list for Search Tools is here... http://groups.google.com/group/search-tools </p>

<p>Search Tools is integrated into the general purpose WARC Tools project. </p>

<p>The longer term plan for Search Tools is to extend the search and analytics API as a foundation for search and analytical applications using web archive files. This application was developed in collaboration with the Oxford Internet Institute and Internet Archive. The content comprises of a comprehensive collection of archived humanities research websites on World War I and World War II, collected as part of the World Wide Web of Humanities (WWWoH) project, funded by NEH and JISC. </p>

 title : The stack-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is basically a playpen for some ideas I have for a distributed application stack for Python.  The StackMapper suite of tools will provide object oriented mapping tools I would like to have, and these tools will deploy generated code to an application stack designed specifically for the tool.  The tools will be developed in Tkinter and most likely be IDLE extensions.  The application stack will simply provide persistence and caching initially, but will eventually aim to be an enterprise-quality distributed application platform for multiple languages including a declarative rule engine.  This project is only in the design and proof-of-concept phase at this point, and is mostly going to be a repository for my experiments with Python.</p>

 title : The vc-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>VCtools is designed to provide the following features: </p>

<p>o Portability between CVS and Subversion--Use the same scripts no matter which version control system you use. </p>

<p>o Consolidation of development policy--If all developers on  a project use VCtools, version control policy decisions can be centralized. </p>

<p>o Project/repository separation--In VCtools, a &quot;project&quot; can be the entire contents of a repository, or a certain subdirectory within the repository.  This allows a repository to contain several projects, but still allows developers to work on project individually without jumping through hoops. </p>

<p>o Ease of use--Certain commands in CVS or (to a lesser degree) Subversion may not function exactly like you want.  VCtools gives you a place to customize these features. </p>

<p>As with all projects, VCtools is a work in progress.  Currently, the core tools were designed on CVS, then ported to Subversion and expanded significantly.  They are now in the process of being ported back to CVS.  Thus there are parts that don&#39;t work on one or the other system.  Caveat codor.</p>

 title : The batchfiles Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>batchfiles contains batch (.bat) and javascript  (.hta and .js) files useful in conjuction with R and R packages on Microsoft Windows. There is no formal installation, each consists of a single file and is independent of the others so just place any or all of them anywhere in your Windows path and you will be able to access them in any Windows console session.  A list of the utilities is given below. </p>

<p>Version 0.5-0 on CRAN works with XP, Vista, Windows 7 and 32 and 64 bit Windows.  (The older version 0.4-3, also on CRAN  works on Vista only and an even older version 0.3-2, also on CRAN, works on XP only.) </p>

<p>Below on this page are sections on:  </p>

<p>NEWSDOWNLOADTROUBLESHOOTING FAQPROGRAM LISTHOWTOVISTA HACKS </p>

<p>NEWSIn addition to the news listed here there is a NEWS file in the package with additional news.  Also there is a README file in the package with documentation and a RESOURCES file in the package with general information on Windows batch files. </p>

<p>May 31/09.  clip2r.js added to development area.  This utility is typically called from a vim macro which places the buffer into the clipboard and then launches clip2r.js.   It then pastes the clipboard into R.   See comments in file for using it from vim. </p>

<p>May 26/09.  #Rscript.bat with bug fixes was uploaded to the development area.  If test.bat is an R file with #Rscript.bat $0 $* as the first line it can be run from the Windows cmd console as test, as test.bat or can be double clicked from Windows Explorer whereas previously some but not all of these worked and which ones worked varied.  Thanks to Nicholas Hirschey for pointing this out and testing. </p>

<p>May 25/09.  batchfiles_0.5-0.zip is now on CRAN and should appear on the mirrors shortly.  The new features are listed here, a list of included programs is shown here and further documentation can be found in the README here. </p>

<p>May 23/09.  Batch files in devel version now work with Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and both 32 and 64 bit Windows.  Thanks to Nicholas Hirschey for testing and contributions. </p>

<p>May 23/09. In the devel version jgr.bat automatically locates both R and that R library holding the JGR package and passes their paths to jgr.exe.  Thus jgr installation only involves placing jgr.exe anywhere on the Windows PATH and installing the JGR R package (and optionally setting the version of java using jselect.exe).  Note that jgr.bat is still in development and is not currently recommended for use. </p>

<p>May 7/09.  Added Q8 to Troubleshooting FAQ below. </p>

<p>Jan 22/09.  Rversions.hta now sets the .RData association as well.  Also RExcelVersion.hta is like Rversions.hta but has some visual enhancements and testing so it works on XP as well (both thanks to Erich Neuwirth).  RExcelVersion.hta is intended for use with the RExcel Excel addin but there is nothing specific to RExcel so it can be used apart from it as well.  RExcelVersion.hta may eventually replace Rversions.hta; however, there may still be some development on it prior to that so for the moment its being kept separate. </p>

<p>Dec 12/08.  New command find-miktex.hta to display path of the MiKTeX bin directory.  Call from Windows console with no arguments or double click from Windows explorer and it will display the path to the MiKTeX executables in a browser-like window.  (Internally this command uses the MiKTeX SDK to find MiKTeX.   This is in contrast to the other utilities in this collection that use a heuristic.) </p>

<p>Dec 6/08.  In the Modifying Path HOWTO we added information on setenv.exe, a free setx clone. </p>

<p>Nov 26/08.  Added information on Windows 7 in the HOWTO section. </p>

<p>Oct 29/08.  Added Q6 and Q7 to troubleshooting section. </p>

<p>Sep 27/08.  Added information on Vista Run Commands (most work in XP too) in the HOWTO section.  </p>

<p>August 2/08.  Added information on Vista SP1 Performance Tuning in the HOWTO section below. </p>

<p>July 18/08. This message on r-devel discusses a number of reasons not to set PATH yourself but, instead, use batch files. </p>

<p>July 10/08.  New file, show-svn-info.hta added.   When run from a Tortoise SVN folder (version 1.5 or higher) it shows some information about it. </p>

<p>July 5/08. batchfiles 0.4-3 is now on CRAN. It fixes a bug in Sweave.bat and Stangle.bat .  </p>

<p>June 25/08. Came across (1) this presentation by Andrej Blejec (in Slovenian), (2) this  Sweave guide by Ista Zahn on the TeX User Group site and (3) these Lyx support files in the CRAN Other Software section that all mention Sweave.bat . </p>

<p>June 23/08.  As toggleDoc was the only perl program in batchfiles it has been removed from the development source to maintain the integrity of the collection.  After batchfiles 0.4-2 it will no longer be distributed with batchfiles; however, it can still be found in batchfiles_0.4-2.zip as it and all past versions of batchfiles are archived on CRAN. </p>

<p>June 15/08.  batchfiles_0.4-2.zip has been uploaded to CRAN.  Details in ANNOUNCE and README. </p>

<p>June 13/08.  Stangle.bat and Sweave.bat have been made to be the same file.  Each queries the name it was called by to determine which to run.   </p>

<p>June 9/08.  Stangle.bat added.  Like Sweave.bat (version 0.3-2 and later), Stangle.bat does not depend on rtools/cygwin/sh.exe . </p>

<p>June 9/08.  sweave.bat is now Sweave.bat in the svn.  This should not make any difference as Windows is case insensitive to file names. </p>

<p>May 20/08.  New facility in the development Source in which the various batchfiles first search for rbatchfilesrc.bat in current directory and then in %userprofile% and then in same directory as the batchfile itself and use first one found, if any.  If one is found then it may contain set statements for R_HOME, R_TOOLS and R_MIKTEX (or a subset of those) and it will use those in place of the registry and its MiKTeX heuristic.  That will allow use of batchfiles without setting any environment variables outside of the batchfiles and without registry access.  It also allows different directories to easily and automatically use different versions of R.  More info is available in the NEWS file.  It is anticipated that most users will not use this facility nor the closely related environment variable facility since its easier just to let the batchfiles automatically determine the various paths by allowing it to access the registry but for some users who wish to set up certain custom installations this may be a useful alternative.  Note that if one does not use this facility or the environment variables provided then the registry is only read, not written with one exception:  That one exception is Rversions.hta (and in batchfiles 0.3-2 also rversions.bat) which can set in the registry which version of R is the current one. It does that by calling RSetReg.exe which is a program that is included with every version of R. </p>

<p>May 19/08.  Added a new question to the Troubleshooting Section below. </p>

<p>May 15/08. Added a workaround for a bug in R in which Sweave.sty is not found when sweaving a file. </p>

<p>Mar 5/08.  Added a Troubleshooting section below. </p>

<p>May 4/08. batchfiles 0.4-1 has been uploaded to CRAN.  It eliminates the need to set the PATH when building R packaes -- previous versions of batchfiles eliminated it only for running R but not building packages.  Also new rtools.bat and el.js utilities.  Details in NEWS, ANNOUNCE and README. </p>

<p>Apr 30/08.  The development source for Rcmd.bat and similar batch files now automatically find rtools in the registry (and they look for MiKTeX heuristically in a few places) so not only does one not have to set the PATH variable for running R but one does not have to set it for building R packages either. </p>

<p>Apr 30/08.  The XP HowTo&#39;s are being moved from the box to the right to their own section on this page below. A new one on a free utility, SetEnv, is added too. </p>

<p>Mar 20/08.  Added two new Vista HowTo&#39;s. The Vista HowTo&#39;s are now below in the HowTo section while the XP HowTo&#39;s (some of which apply to Vista too) are in the Links box to the right.   </p>

<p>Jan 16/08.  batchfiles version 0.4-0 is now on CRAN.  (Version 0.4-0 and all future versions will be tested on Vista. Reports from XP users using it are welcome.  Version 0.3-2 was tested on XP so XP users can use that.) </p>

<p>Jan 12/08.  sweave.bat has been made independent of Rterm.bat so now all batch and javascript files are standalone and do not depend on each other or on other external programs other than possibly R in some cases.  (toggleDoc.pl that was just contributed does depend on perl and on toggleDoc.js so it is the only utility with non-R dependencies.) </p>

<p>Jan 12/08. Removed find-miktex.bat, Rfind.bat, makepkg.bat and withgs.bat from the development Source -- they are still available in batchfiles version 0.3-2. </p>

<p>Jan 12/08. Added toggleDoc.pl/toggleDoc.js, a perl program and associated file, that adds a toggle box to the 00Index.html file in each package in your library.  When the toggle box is checked, it collapses similar HTML help lines into one.   Try checking and unchecking the toggle box labeled Show All at this page to get the idea.

<p>Jan 2/08.  There is a new file, RguiStart.bat, in the development Source that starts up Rgui.exe in the directory specified by its first argument.  On Vista put RGuiStart.bat in the %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo folder and then in Windows Explorer you can right click any folder &gt; SendTo &gt; RGuiStart.bat to start R in that folder.  See comments in these r-help posts: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-January/149455.html and  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-January/149458.html  RGuiStart.bat is actually the same file as Rgui.bat, Rcmd.bat, R.bat, Rterm.bat, Rscript.bat, #Rscript.bat and Rjgr.bat.  The common script queries what name it was called by to determine what to do. </p>

<p>Sep 9/07.  In the development version of batchfiles there is a new Rversions.hta for Vista with some code cleanup and improved heuristic for locating R.   </p>

<p>DOWNLOADGet the latest release from CRAN or the development source from the Source tab above.  Version 0.4-0 and later have been tested on Vista only while version 0.3-2 and prior were tested on XP only. </p>

<p>TROUBLESHOOTING FAQQ1. Rcmd.bat and similar batch files do not find the rtools. </p>

<p>A1. Make sure you have the most recent version of rtools.  Registry support was added to rtools in April or May of 2008 so with older versions of the rtools, the rtools may not be automatically located. </p>

<p>Q2. Rcmd BATCH does not work. </p>

<p>A2. In very old versions of R (prior to R 2.5.1) Rcmd.exe BATCH (which is, in turn, used by Rcmd.bat in batchfiles) had problems with pathnames with embedded spaces.  If you are still using an R version that old its time to upgrade! </p>

<p>Q3. When running sweave.bat the Sweave.sty file is not found. </p>

<p>A3. This is a known problem with MiKTeX for which a workaround will likely be forthcoming in version 2.8.0 of R.  In the meantime here are three different solutions: (1) put sweave.sty in the same directory as your Rnw file (or other place where MiKTeX can find it) and put this line in your .Rnw file: \usepackage{Sweave}   (2) A more drastic solution, which is not recommended but has been reported to work, is to reinstall R into a directory whose pathname has no spaces in it.  (3) Another solution (warning: I have not verified this one) is to set the SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT environment variable in Windows to FALSE.  For more on SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT see the Sweave manual and this post.  (There is information on setting environment variables in the HowTo section below.) </p>

<p>Q4. I understand that Rcmd.bat and the other tools look in the Windows registry to find R and the Rtools.  Can I use Rcmd.bat and the others if I cannot or wish not to modify the registry? </p>

<p>A4. There are two alternatives to using the registry: </p>

<p>1. Set R_HOME, R_TOOLS and R_MIKTEX environment variables.  In that case Rcmd.bat and the other tools will use the indicated paths rather than look in the registry.  For example, do the following (or to do it permanently set the paths via the control panel or via the free Redmond Path utility): </p>

<p>set R_HOME=C:\Program Files\R\R-2.7.0
<br/>set R_TOOLS=C:\Rtools
<br/>set R_MIKTEX=C:\Program Files\MikTex 2.7\miktex\bin(Note that MiKTeX is found via a heuristic, not the registry, so if you have placed MiKTeX in the usual place then you may not need to set R_MIKTEX.) </p>

<p>2. The other alternative is to create a file called rbatchfilesrc.bat that contains the three lines above or similar lines and place that file in the current directory, in %userprofile% or in the same directory as Rcmd.bat and other tools in which case it will search for it in the given order and temporarily set the environment variables as indicated but only while Rcmd.bat or other file from batchfiles is running. </p>

<p>Q5. Rcmd INSTALL ... does not work. </p>

<p>A5. This is a commonly caused by a problem in customizations you made to your  Rprofile.site file.   In R, this shows the path of that file: </p>

<p>file.path(R.home(), &quot;etc&quot;, &quot;Rprofile.site&quot;)See this r-devel post for more info. </p>

<p>Q6. I created my own batch file which calls Rcmd.bat from the batchfiles distribution (or other bat file); however, after Rcmd runs it does not return to my batch file. </p>

<p>A6. In Windows, when one batch file invokes another by simply giving its name as in: </p>

<p>rem this is in a batch file
<br/>Rcmd.bat check %1the called batch file does not return to the caller -- i.e. in this example Rcmd.bat would not return to the invoking batch file. In order to achieve automatic return the call batch command must be used: </p>

<p>:: if call were not used on 1st line processing would never reach: echo finished
<br/>call Rcmd.bat check %1
<br/>echo finishedThis is a general aspect of Windows batch files and is not specific to Rcmd.bat . </p>

<p>Q7.  As in R FAQ 2.8 I upgraded from one version of R to another, e.g. 2.7.2 to R 2.8.0, and then used  </p>

<p>cd \Users\JoeDoe\Documents\R\win-library
<br/>movedir 2.7 2.8(or used copydir) and then invoked the Packages | Update menu but now RGtk2 and packages depending on it do not work.  (Although we know of no other packages to which this applies its possible that such exist.  In that case use the analogous answer.)   </p>

<p>A7.  In 2.8.0 just reinstall RGtk2: </p>

<p>install.packages(&quot;RGtk2&quot;, dep = TRUE)then exit and re-enter R.   </p>

<p>R FAQ 2.8 actually recommends using update.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE, ask = FALSE) rather than the menu and its possible that that would have resolved the RGtk2 problem although it could also result in many packages being downloaded so it could add substantially to the time.   Resolve whether using `checkBuilt` makes a difference. </p>

<p>Q8. I get an error message concerning a directory that seems unrelated to what I am doing. </p>

<p>A8. There is now defensive code included to automatically protect against bad paths but just in case it misses certain conditions check your PATH to see if it has a problem.  For example, check if a directory is in your PATH but does not exist.  The free Redmond Path utility can be used to easily remove the offending directory from your path.   Also note that there are length limits to the path.  See this link to Microsoft&#39;s knowledge base article. </p>

<p>Upgrade from XP to Windows 7  See PC World article </p>

<p>Set Environment Variables Permanently through batch  SetEnv </p>

<p>Install package from CRAN  On your desktop, right click on R and choose Run As Administaror .   Then when R starts choose the Packages | Install Package(s) menu item.  Alternately, from the Windows command line use the elevation and Rgui batchfiles, el.js and Rgui.bat, to start R as shown below and then proceed to Packages menu, as before: </p>

<p>el RguiAnother way to run R elevated is to click the Start button in the lower left of the screen (on a Vista machine) and enter cmd.exe into the Search box terminating it not with Enter but with Shift-Ctrl-Enter.  That will give a command line which is elevated.  Then run R from the command line using the batchfiles&#39; Rgui command. </p>

<p>If despite doing the above that you get a message about packages.html not being writable then find the offending file in Windows Explorer and right-click that file&#39;s name choosing Properties &gt; Security tab and reset the permissions appropriately.  You may or may not also need to do the same thing on that file&#39;s folder. </p>

<p>Vista Performance Turning   Microsoft has a free downloadable 14 page PDF document entitled  Windows Vista Performance Tuning that discusses improving the performance of a Vista computer running the SP1 update.   Also, ways to improve the performance of a Vista system (plus a link to an even longer list) was published in the NY Times Technology column October 9, 2008. </p>

<p>Am I Running Service Pack 1 (SP1) on Vista? Determine whether you are running SP1 of Vista or not.  When reading this note that the original Vista is referred to by Microsoft as Build 6000 whereas the SP1 release is called Build 6001. </p>

<p>Modifying PATH  Users of the batchfiles presented here are largely freed from having to modify the path in the first place; however, if you do need to do it then this is how.  The PATH command from the Windows console will change the PATH for that session (PATH /? for more info).  To permanently change the path (1) these instructions describe how to do it through the control panel or (2) one can use the setx command from the Windows resource kit (however, it does not come with Windows and costs extra but there is a free clone called setenv.exe) or (3) the free Redmond Path utility which makes it particularly easy to set your path by providing a gui editor into which it dumps your path, one component per line, so you can visually edit it and save it back.  This PATH info all applies to XP as well. </p>

<p>Ready Boost  Windows Vista allows one to use the storage on a USB key for extra cache space.  This will improve performance, particularly if there was only a single hard drive and small main memory. Only USB keys with sufficiently fast storage will work.  More information on this feature is available from:Tom Archer&#39;s MSDN blog and Tom Archer&#39;s FAQ. </p>

<p>Run Commands  A long list of commands that can be entered in a Windows console: Run Commands </p>

<p>User Account Control and Other Tweaks  Windows 7 has improvements to make UAC less annoying; however, even if you do not have it certain Windows 7 features can be simulated in XP and Vista as discusssed Get Windows 7 Features Right Now. </p>

<p>File Associations  File associations are performed from the command line using the assoc and ftype commands in Windows.  From the Windows console try help assoc and help ftype and also try issuing the two commands without arguments to view the present associations. </p>

<p>AutoHotKey Scripts  There are AutoHotKey scripts by Jose Quesada to send code from the vim editor to R, to start R and to autoclose parentheses. </p>

<p>Suspending a Task DTaskManager is a free 2000/XP/Vista Windows utility that can be used to suspend tasks. </p>

<p>Reg String to Start Rgui See https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-January/224444.html.  It does not start up a separate cmd window and works on Windows 7 too. </p>

<p>VISTA HACKSThese HowTo&#39;s are termed hacks since they are not recommended but are provided for the curious or frustrated. </p>

<p>Vista introduced the User Account Control (UAC) feature that essentially lets you run as a least authorized user rather than essentially as an Administrator the way you had to run in XP.  This improves security but every so often you will get prompts asking you to elevate your level for a certain task. If you have upgraded to Vista SP1 then you won&#39;t get quite as many.  Some people have described this as frustrating; however, for most people, in fact, it probably will not occur more than a few times a day.  At any rate at the risk of compromising the security of your system, its possible to disable or partially disable UAC as discussed below.  (Note that UAC problems should not be confused with file permission problems.  For file permission problems right click the file in Windows Explorer and choose Properties and then the Security tab and adjust the settings appropriately.)   </p>

<p>UAC  For the best security leave UAC alone but it but if you feel you must disable or partially disable it then this article by Scott Lowe explains your options.  These including turning it on and off via msconfig, the control panel, the registry or group policy, disabling prompts without disabling UAC entirely and running selected applications at Administrative level.  Also see this article on how to disable UAC, this information on tweakUAC which makes it easy to turn UAC on and off and to run it in Quiet mode which eliminates prompts but only when you are running as Adminstrator. Also this link shows a 12 step procedure to Disable UAC for certain apps only using Microsoft&#39;s free Compatability Toolkit. Also see explanation by Greg Schultz.  Another article on making UAC less annoying can be found at HowToGeek.  You can also sign into an Adminstrator account to circumvent UAC as shown in this video.</p>

 summary : <p>Please note that there is now an installer available for the Bluefish Editor for Windows since version 1.3.7. </p>

<p>The version listed here is severely outdated and unsupported! </p>

<p>Please use the installers available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluefish/files/  
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> </p>

<p>Bluefish-win32built on bluefish 1.0.7This is just a minimal working version of bluefish on Windows. </p>

<p>In order to run the program, GTK+ must be installed and the installation path added to the system path variable. </p>

<p>The GTK+ runtime is available here as an installer: 
<br/>sourceforge downloads  
<br/>Select file gtk+-2.10.13-setup.exe 
<br/>     </p>

<p>It should work with the runtime listed below: 
<br/>http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.10/gtk+-2.10.14.zip 
<br/>Additionally, the shared libraries in the bin folder are also needed as they are not provided by the GTK runtime installer. </p>

<p>The release version listed here was compiled with MSYS and MinGW on Win XP sp2. There is a bunch of dependencies required to build bluefish, most are available from the above ftp repository.  As soon as I can find some time I will generate a list of the depedencies and the download locations. 
<br/>One note, Orbit2 needed to be an older version as the newest version at the compile time would not work.  This appears to be an issue with Orbit2 as other programs seem to have the same problem. 
<br/>     </p>

<p>Please use the issue tracker to report bugs. </p>

<p>I finally got a hold of a Vista machine for testing and Bluefish-win should now install without error. 
<br/>The installer has been updated to download GTK+ and install it if it is not installed. 
<br/>May 12, 2008 </p>

<p>Added the language translation files to the installer.  I am waiting for feedback. </p>

<p>Jan 21,2010 </p>

<p>After more than a year without being able to work on this project,it is time to call it quits.  At least now there is officially a build for Windows.  
<br/>As of February 1, 2010, I will be removing the download links from this sight although svn will still be available.</p>

 summary : <p>CharacterGenCharacterGen is for writers to quickly generate large numbers of filler characters with basic features like race, gender, eye and hair color, hair style, etc.  In addition, it is flexible enough to make quite complete character  physical profiles for use on primary and secondary characters.  These profiles can be output as plain text, xhtml, or in CharacterGen&#39;s native XML format. </p>

<p>Program HistoryI originally wrote CharacterGen in Visual Basic 6, teaching myself the code as I went along, and hosted the program as an open source project at SourceForge.Net.  CharacterGen v1.0.0 was released on June 10, 2005, after which I put the project more or less on the shelf.  More recently, I returned to school, intending to get a degree as an applications programmer.  Having completed the VB.Net portion of this course, I&#39;ve decided to return to CharacterGen and re-code it from the ground up in VB.Net, and chose Google Code to host the project, unhappy with SourceForge&#39;s overly complex and generally useless features.  Additionally, returning to school to learn to program opens the opportunity to work on another program that I have long wished to work on, World Binder.  One of the features that I would like to work into that is direct import of the profiles generated by CharacterGen. </p>

<p>Project Status2007-09-02 - </p>

<p>For those that think the project has died; it hasn&#39;t, I&#39;ve just been waiting for someting to come, and that has finally done so.  My school has updated its courses to use Visual Studio 2005, and as part of that, I&#39;ve gotten a copy of it as well.  I&#39;ve known that this was coming for awhile now, and I&#39;ve decided to upgrade CharacterGen to the newer version of Visual Basic.  While this means that a lot of the project progress will be reset, it also means less code in general, and better long-term maintainability as I&#39;ll be able to use some of the more advanced features of VB05.  I&#39;ve added a build of the last VB2003 version of CharacterGen to the downloads, and expect to be back up to speed fairly quickly.  Guests and users are welcomed to begin joining the general mailing list if you have questions or comments, and of course all of the code is available in the SVN repository. </p>

<p>A Note From the DeveloperAs suggested above, and at the World Binder project, I am a writer myself, and so both of my current project ideas are, of course, related to writing.  Both are tools made to address small, but often surprisingly difficult aspects of writing.  CharacterGen&#39;s scope is limited only to characters, while World Binder&#39;s scope is that of consistent story world, but in the end, they are both simple ideas.</p>

<p>Приложение собирается из набора модулей, каждый из которых реализует отдельную функциональность: диалог, э лемент управления, источник данных итд.  Структура приложения описывается в виде XML дерева, которое хранится либо в самом приложении, либо в базе данных, что делает DynInt хорошей платформой для построения клиентов к БД. </p>

<p>На данный момент работа над проектом остановлена.  Обдумывается расширение платформы для работы с вебом, однако, скорее всего, проект будет свёрнут.</p>

 title : The exegete Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The exegete compendium comprises both the malibu open source machine learning workbench and other projects still under development geared toward biological object feature extraction. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>So far, a limited release has been provided to a select group of individuals who are helping with quality control. For more documentation, visit the malibu home. </p>

<p>OverviewThe current version of malibu is 1.1 triarii. The triarii were the veteran soldiers in the Roman legion forming the third standard line of infantry; malibu has undergone three major releases and triarii represents the first release to reach a level of maturity such that it can be easily used by members of the wider scientific community.  The primary users of malibu will be researchers or students with a solid background in computing (e.g. while it runs under windows, it was primarily developed for Linux) and some understanding of machine learning. </p>

<p>malibu is organized around a core set of binary classifiers and was originally developed to support binary classification. As research projects progressed, other interesting learning problems cropped up and a set of wrappers were added to allow the binary classifiers to solve such problems. For example, malibu includes the Costing, which allows any binary classifier to handle both importance weighted and cost-sensitive classification problems. This approach to wrapping binary classifiers (as opposed to using only those that can naturally support the problem) has two primary advantages. First, no one classifiers performs well on every problem; each classifier has a particular bias that allows it to perform well on some problems while performing poorly on others. Thus, using wrappers gives the user access to a larger number of algorithms from which to choose the one with the best bias. Second, the wrappers can be layered to create any number of algorithms handling a wide variety of problems. For example, the a calibration algorithm can be layered on the Costing algorithm (on a classifier) to solve a cost-sensitive learning problem requiring accurate probability estimates of confidence in a prediction.

 title : The fahlogstats-net Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FAHLogStats.NETThis is a port of Buzzard&#39;s &#39;FAHStats&#39; project to the C# / .NET platform. </p>

<p>FAHLogStats.NET is a .NET 2.0 application to collect, aggregate and display information about Folding@Home clients. </p>

<p>Note that the original FAHLogStats code isn&#39;t used directly in the port; the concepts, some of the design, and some of the other layout certainly is. </p>

<p>New in v0.2.33Performance should be much improved, as I&#39;m no longer waiting for a download from a host to process the existing log file (this occurred on load). </p>

<p>Also, a silly error where some of the utility functions would be uselessly called thousands of times has been corrected, and this has cut some operations from as much as 50 seconds down to 2-4 seconds. </p>

<p>New in v0.2.32Most bugs are fixed, although a new and rather disturbing bug has surfaced. </p>

<p>Specifically, the application sometimes seems to exhibit a deadlock (stops responding, has to be killed). I think it happens during scheduled updates, and it definitely occurs using my test harness set of clients (19 of them, of which 2 are local to the computer, 13 are SMB network paths and 4 are FTP). </p>

<p>Also, performance under Vista seems to really suck, and I don&#39;t yet know why.</p>

 summary : <p>When using a 1.1.1 Apple iPhone, if you create ringtones using SendSong or a program like that, when you sync your iPhone with iTunes, it will erase your ringtones. So, to solve this problem, I made this program that will path iTunes so it won&#39;t erase them anymore. But, if you use this, I think (I haven&#39;t tested it) you won&#39;t be able to trasnfer the ringtones you created using iTunes (i.e from iTunes Music Store) to the phone. This program is a windows executable, but will path both Windows and Mac OS iTunes.</p>

 title : The logscrobbler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>LogScrobbler is a Windows utility written to allow users of Portable Digital Audio Players, that are running Rockbox or other firmware that generates a log file that stores which songs you have played, to later be synchronized to last.fm using my LogScrobbler Tool. </p>

<p>Changelog0.15 (July 2007) </p>

<p>Simplified interface Track list is hidden by default unless you want to select which tracks to upload Fewer options/buttons as some were redundant Added status bar to track progress of log file reading/uploading Customised Audioscrobbler.NET library to return a slightly more meaningful error message when an upload fails Massive code cleanups  </p>

<p>0.14c(Dec 2006) </p>

<p>Fixed exception when opening window from tray with select files left open. </p>

<p>0.14 (REV 57) </p>

<p>Fixed some bugs with settings path. Added &quot;Fix zero time stamps&quot; as a one-time use button, or permanent setting(this option should help those who have players that do not time stamp the played tracks(no internal clock) this adds up the length of all the checked items, then subtracts the total from the current time and fits all the tracks up to the current time. (hope that make sense :-)). widened the form as its starting to get crowded. </p>

<p>0.13 (REV 56) </p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask, even the version number was bad. </p>

<p>0.12c (REV 54) </p>

<p>fixed bug - if items are unchecked do not include them in the time shift. added row colors, and unselected turn gray. </p>

<p>0.12 (REV 50) </p>

<p>Settings file LogScrobbler.txt should now be in app directory(not C: Let me know if this blows up) Added Save password checkbox(I will encrypt soon I swear) :-) Added checkbox to display Avatar or not(Runs faster off, but funner on) </p>

<p>0.11 (REV 45) (Skipped 0.10 felt wierd about that number for a version :-)) </p>

<p>Added last.fm avatar image, and made it clickable to take you to your page. Changed filter for file browse to allow for .scrobbler.log (for someone that said their file is .scrobbler-timeless.log) :-) (not sure this fixes all your issues) (Sorry not a lot of useful stuff in this one) </p>

<p>0.9 (REV 40) </p>

<p>Display track length as time format xx:xx rather than total seconds in track selection listview. Added setting to exit LogScrobbler instead of minimize to tray. Added Close button in &quot;Show my last posts to Last.fm&quot; dialog. </p>

<p>0.8 (REV 39) </p>

<p>Added Save Settings button, (used to have to hit Go, but couldn&#39;t if there is no log file yet) Added similar Last.FM skins and save the setting when switched.(doesnt affect the about screen, don&#39;t think anyone will care) ;-) </p>

<p>0.7 </p>

<p>Added ability to see last 10 items posted to last.fm, in another little window(double click to go to the artist page) Added ability to shift the time of the tracks from the log forward to after the last track posted to Last.fm Added link to your last.fm in systray menu minor bug fixes. </p>

<p>0.6 </p>

<p>I think this fixes some issue with safely removing usb device. added setting for exit after processing complete added progress bar. added this file :-) </p>

<p>0.5 </p>

<p>added selectable list to sync fixed small bugs </p>

<p>0.1 - 0.4 </p>

<p>Don&#39;t remember all the items - started this file at 0.6 :-( added about window Delete file after processing option Save settings</p>

<p>Not Dead Yet!I have almost dug myself out of the hole I got into by doing LOMM beta 2 instead of some high-priority and paying) work :-) I have some nice improvements for the final release and am excited to get it out to you all. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m thinking of moving from code.google.com to codeplex for hosting. There isn&#39;t anything really wrong with code.google, but codeplex is much nicer to use (for example, you can get email notification when a release is available and it has discussion threads as well as wiki). I doubt anyone cares, but if so, speak up! </p>

<p>See you all in-game soon... as soon as I get my client happy again. </p>

<p>Thank you!Version 1.0.4 has passed 800 downloads! And 150+ of the 2.0 beta! For something I wrote for my own use and put out there for fun, I&#39;m amazed. Thank you all.  </p>

<p>LOMM 2.0 Beta 2 is hereCheck it out in the downloads page. This release includes toolbars and macros as well as a partial help file.  </p>

<p>New preview with screenshots of Beta 2 macro featuresNew preview! </p>

<p>2.0 Beta 2 is almost ready. It will include macros, some cleanup to the overall UI, and icons! Icons in the menus, on relevant buttons, on the tab panes, ... Icon everywhere! I think it makes the app a lot easier to use quicky and generally ties things together helpfully. That is thanks to the FamFamFam Silk Icon set (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/). </p>

<p>2.0 Beta 1 is here!Adventurous users can download the 2.0 beta. This new release includes: </p>

<p>Support for multiple songs in one abc file Syntax highlighting in the ABC editor Lyrics support when playing The next beta should include the advanced macros. I have them working here but need to polish up the editor so you can create your own without editing xml files :-) This is beta software: I haven&#39;t had any problems, but back up your abc files before installing. This software does edit files, after all, and I don&#39;t want you to lose anything if you uncover a bug. </p>

<p>Speaking of bugs, please send any bug reports or questions to me here by (in order of preference) this web site, email (carborunda.riverside@pobox.com), PM on the LOTRO forums (username Xowl), or in-game mail (Carborunda on Brandywine). Thanks! </p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>LOMM Features:See the UI page for screenshots! </p>

<p>Lists all ABC files visible to play in-game Shows the title as well as filename (display can be sorted on title) Area to edit ABC files for quick edit/play turnaround Shows line and column numbers to decode LOTRO error messages Sends commands to LOTRO to:  toggle /music mode on and off play a chosen file queue a file to play synchronized with your fellowship initiate synchronized play Quick access to emotes  dances (base and learned) /moods (all) emotes likely to be used when socializing (greetings, sitting, responding to music, etc.) Grouped as Meet and Greet, Converse, Settle In, Respond, and Hobbits Emotes that bestow a title or new emote on the target when used often enough Quick reference page of LOTRO ABC syntax Can run always-on-top and semi-transparent over LOTRO if desired Known issues: Reports that commands aren&#39;t sent to LOTRO on 64 bit windows. </p>

 title : The notable Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Notable is a simple, completely free note-taking application for Windows that is optimized for people who make lots bulleted lists. I was inspired to make it after having worked in the computer industry for a while, and I realized that no note-taking option really suited my need to manage my large number of meetings and task lists. </p>

<p>Notable is organized as an inbox of rich text notes - essentially, Notepad with an inbox on top. However, unlike Notepad, the text editor supports formatting and is heavily optimized for bulleted lists, which makes taking down notes quickly (e.g., taking notes in a meeting) extremely easy. You can archive notes to your hard disk easily, and there is a shortcut to open up a note in Microsoft Word/Wordpad. </p>

 title : The nstub Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NStub? What&#39;s NStub? NStub is a unit test generator for .NET assemblies. You simply point NStub at the assembly containing the types you wish to test, pick the types and methods that your interested in from interface, choose where you want the resulting source files to be created at, and click GO!. That&#39;s all there is to it! </p>

<p>What do I get? Your resulting group of source files will contain one stubbed test method for each method that you selected. The code is clean, clearly documented and is already decorated to work with your chosen test framework. All you have to do is fill in the logic. Each group of source files even comes with an associated project allowing you to quickly open the files in Visual Studio and start editing. Not using Visual Studio? No problem! Just open the files individually in your chosen development environment and go to work. </p>

<p>That sounds great...except for... NStub is fully extensible, allowing you to create plug-ins not only to support multiple testing frameworks but also to generate the testing code in any .NET compliant language. The sky is the limit to what you can accomplish. </p>

<p>There a few driving principles behind NStub, we consider these our &#39;bill of rights&#39; so to speak and hold them in highest regarding when making all design and development decisions. No matter what functionality is added to NStub, you can always rest assured that none of these inalienable rights will ever be violated. </p>

<p>All projects will compile immediately after generation NStub will not &#39;lock you into&#39; any particular testing framework or language There will be no aspect of NStub that you can&#39;t extend, alter, or modify to suit your own purposes This sounds like something I could use! Great, then give it a shot! Just download our current stable build and let us know what you think. Have a suggestion or want to help out? Even better! Just drop us a line and we&#39;ll be happy to listen to what you have to say!</p>

 title : The odbc-dbd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>odbc-dbdDriver for the Apache Portable Runtime to connect via ODBC to various databases.   </p>

<p>This project is now obsolete.   The ODBC driver is included with Apache APR 1.3 and with Apache httpd 2.2   Please use the Apache ODBC driver instead of this one.  </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>odbc-dbd is now included in APR 1.3odbc-dbd is now included in the Apache APR Utilities - apr-util - starting with version 1.3. </p>

<p>Of course I will keep the APR 1.2 version alive here for some time, and address any issues reported with it.  Eventually, however, this project will be discontinued.   </p>

<p>Projects get discontinued for many reasons of course, but I cannot think of a better reason than having it included in a larger, more well-know project like Apache/APR. </p>

<p>C Source Code (Windows and Unix)This driver is named apr_dbd_odbc.so on Unix, and apr_dbd_odbc.dll on Windows. It can be used: </p>

<p>... with Apache version 2.2.4+ and mod_dbd to perform user authentication against any SQL database which provides ODBC access.  Note that it may be necessary to re-compile Apache to enable DBD drivers as described in the Linux or Windows instructions. </p>

<p>... with a program built using the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) version 1.2.8+ to access SQL databases in a database-independent way via the APR DBD module. Most database vendors provide ODBC driversOracle, PostgreSQL, IBM-DB2, MySQL, Informix, Sybase, SQLServer, MS Access, Foxpro, and many others provide ODBC drivers.  </p>

<p>Apache Derby databases can be accessed using the IBM DB2-Connect ODBC driver which is included in IBM DB2 Express-C </p>

<p>Apache 2.2.4 (or later), or APR 1.2.8 (or later) is required for odbc-dbd v1.0.  </p>

<p>ModulesApache 2.2 includes a module for authentication. For access logging and virtual host configuration using DBD, see dbd-modules. </p>

<p>ContactVisit the discussion group for odbc-dbd. </p>

<p>Please feel free to send email to the Project Owner @gmail.com with ideas, comments, or reports about how odbc-dbd is working for you.  There is also a discussion about odbc-dbd in the Apache Lounge Apache/Windows forum. </p>

<p>Release HistoryVersion 1.3.0 June 16, 2008 - APR 1.3 now includes odbc-dbd.   Version 1.3.0 May 28, 2008 - Version to work with APR 1.3 or APR 1.4/Apache 2.3 is no longer experimental.  CLOB and BLOB datatypes supported. Source for 1.3.x is SVN /trunk. Most users should continue to use odbc-dbd 1.0.x with released versions of Apache 2.2 or APR 1.2.  Version 1.0.10 March 19, 2008 - Fix problems when a connection is explicitly closed, and an associated statement is closed at a later time. Added support for ODBC-V2 builds and linking with a user-specified ODBC library. Handle NULL CLOBs. Reports the original error when there is a subsequent SQLHANDLE error. Version 1.0.9 February 10, 2008 - Fix &amp;nbsp;Issue #4&amp;nbsp; - string length when binary SELECT columns are automatically converted to strings. Version 1.0.8 January 7, 2008 - Minor Unix build change. gcc 4.1+ requires the &#39;-fno-strict-aliasing&#39; compiler switch.  Version 1.0.7 is still current for Windows. Version 1.0.7 December 2, 2007 - Better handling of drivers which return &quot;Driver not capable&quot; for column length or octet-length (specifically: Oracle TimesTen ODBC driver). Version 1.0.6 November 13, 2007 - Accepts NULL parameters Version 1.0.5 October 27, 2007 - Re-packaged into separate Windows and Unix downloads. Updated the GNU autobuild files for Unix. Source for 1.0.x is now SVN /branches/1.0. No functional changes from version 1.0.4. Version 1.3.0 October 24, 2007 - Experimental version to work with APR 1.3/Apache 2.3 .  Source for 1.3.x is SVN /trunk. Most users should continue to use odbc-dbd 1.0.x with released versions of Apache 2.2 or APR 1.2.  Version 1.0.4 September 15, 2007 - Fixed &amp;nbsp;Issue #3&amp;nbsp; - incorrect argument to cleanup from odbc_select.  Open errors are now always written to stderr (i.e. to the Apache error log). Version 1.0.3 September 1, 2007 - Improved open error message retention when apr_dbd is initialized from a different thread, also added missing files for Unix build. Version 1.0.2 August 12, 2007 - Fixes &amp;nbsp;Issue #2&amp;nbsp; - Additional fix for prepared statements close. Version 1.0.1 July 10, 2007 - Fixes &amp;nbsp;Issue #1&amp;nbsp; - Prepared statements are implicitly closed when connection is closed.</p>

 title : The p4shelf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewA Visual Studio Team Studio feature that had immediate appeal for me is shelving. The goal of this tool is to dupe the core of that functionality in Perforce, the source control solution used at my workplace. </p>

<p>What this app does is take a series of files that you have checked out from a P4 depot, bundle them up, and then set them aside for you to work on again later. A very handy trick when you&#39;re hip deep in a code change and an emergency crash bug comes in that same code file. This tools lets you shelve and set aside the changes you&#39;re working on now and come back to them after you&#39;ve fixed the bug.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m very interested in getting feedback on this app. Please direct any comments, questions and especially complaints to p4shelf@natecleveland.org. </p>

<p>StatusI&#39;ve ceased working on this project. There are many things I&#39;d like to add (better UI or diff functionality for example) but I&#39;ve got other projects I&#39;d rather spend my free time on. In its current state it works well enough for my day to day use and I find myself using it quite a bit.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to return and finish it up some point in the future. Probably. I could easily be convinced to do this sooner rather than later if interest was expressed. Lacking that interest however its difficult to dedicate the time to it when it really does everything I need it to right now.  </p>

<p>Known IssuesUI SucksYep. It does. Really, really hard. You can probably feel the pull from your computer screen, because I certainly can. </p>

<p>COM WoesIf you just download the binaries and run them the app will crash. Issue goes away if you run &quot;install.bat&quot; in the bin directory. This will install the Perforce COM object that the application depends on. </p>

<p>Manage Tab FilesThe files window in the manage tab doesn&#39;t scroll. This means you can only see the first few files that are in the shelf.</p>

<br/>pgrep v1.00.x071127
<br/>by Programus (programus@gmail.com)
<br/>------------------------------------
<br/>An open source and free command line grep like tool.
<br/>It prints out the paragraphs which contains the pattern instead of lines.</p>

<p>Usage: pgrep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE] ...
<br/> python pgrep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE] ...</p>

<p>Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input and output a paragraph separated by separator.
<br/>Example: python pgrep.py -i &#39;hello world&#39; menu.h main.c</p>

<p>OPTIONS:
<br/>-c, --count
<br/>        Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
<br/>        With the -v, --invert-match option, count non-matching lines.
<br/>-e, --regexp=PATTERN
<br/>        Use pattern as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with a -.
<br/>-f, --file=FILE
<br/>        Obtain patterns from file, one per line.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.
<br/>-h, --help
<br/>        Print this help
<br/>-i, --ignore-case
<br/>        Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files.
<br/>-l, --files-with-matches
<br/>        Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.
<br/>        The scanning of every file will stop on the first match.
<br/>-p, --separator=SEPARATOR
<br/>        Specify a separator. The default separator is &#39;\n\s*\n&#39;.
<br/>-v, --invert-match
<br/>        Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching parts.</p>

 summary : <p>PriithonPriithon is a platform for image analysis and image analysis algorithm development. </p>

<p>While the focus here is on algorithm development, it makes it very easy to develop applications that would not require any programming skills, i.e. making &quot;end user&quot; biologist&#39;s or astronomer&#39;s applications. </p>

<p>Priithon is easy to install: download a single zip archive and unpack. (It requires Python to be installed. More info is on the PriithonWiki.) </p>

<p>Target audienceWhile Priithon is mainly used (by myself) as a daily work horse for looking at microscope images of some cell nuclei or other biology, there are many aspects that are not primarily geared for my own benefit:  
<br/>I want others to be able to install Priithon with minimal effort.  This means: 
<br/>Simple one-step unpacking of a package file  No system administrator permissions, or system knowledge, is required     </p>

<p>It is easy to make custom application, that allow someone to perform advanced image analysis tasks, who does not have any prior training in programming or scripting   It is the best platform I know, to teach (complete) programming novices some basic skills in scripting The Python programming language is generally considered clean and easy to learn The PyShell interface gives helpful function descriptions and pop-up lists of available functions as you type  </p>

<p>Transparent modular multi-tier design going from interactive explorations to algorithms to scientist-oriented applications Priithon sessions are (auto-) saved into text files, documenting every step of interactive explorations Copy and paste into a Python-module file creates reusable functions Functions are then fine-tuned into cleanly parametrized algorithms Simple GUI interfaces visualize the set of &quot;most-used&quot; parameters and allow execution per mouse-click Organizing multiple GUI windows with few-line setup functions into a &quot;drag-into-Priithon-to-execute&quot; script file</p>

 title : The seam-carving-gui Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Seam Carving GUI is a GUI front end to CAIR, which is an implementation of Arial Shamir&#39;s seam carving algorithm (aka content aware image resizing, aka image retargeting). </p>

<p>A Little HistoryI ran into a comment by Andy Owen re the Slashdot article about Content-Aware Image Resizing and decided his late night hack was cool enough to deserve an easy to use interface. Besides, after a few days of seeing the impressive demonstration video about the SIGGRAPH paper on seam carving I found myself wishing I could be doing seam carving on some images of my own. </p>

<p>Thus version 1.0 through 1.3 of the Seam Carving GUI came to be. Andy has moved onto other things and I got an email from Brain_Recall (Joe) about his work on writing a more true-to-the-paper form of the algorithm. His stuff looked really quite impressive so I egged him on. Once his code was functionally complete I change the Seam Carving GUI to use CAIR for the backend. Not only does his code work much better for stretching images (and in general), but it&#39;s also multi-threaded and has a couple cool new features. So with the new backend, the Seam Carving GUI reached version 1.4. Since then I have been keeping up with improvements done in CAIR by Joe and adding features and documentation as requested from users came in. </p>

<p>Version History1.11 </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR 2.19 with speed improvements (Brain_ReCall) Ported latest CAIR to Mac OS X (use mach semaphores) (Gabe) Windows build with MSVC 2008 for speed improvements (Gabe) Windows build has installer (Gabe) Updated to Qt 4.5.2 (Gabe) </p>

<p>1.10 </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR 2.17 with speed improvements (Brain_ReCall) Update progress bars to use new CAIR callbacks. (Gabe) </p>

<p>1.9 </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR 2.15.1 (Brain_ReCall) Added forward energy parameter (Brain_ReCall) Progress bar for HD Quality (Brain_ReCall) Retain/Remove/Clear Brush now scaled to zoom level (Brain_ReCall) Upgraded to Qt 4.4.1 (Gabe) Save/Load Mask as PNG (Gabe) The Mask is saved/restored in undo/redo operations (Gabe) Shortcuts changed to be platform specific (Gabe) </p>

<p>1.8 </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR 2.13 Performance improvements CAIR license change to LGPL v2.1 seam-carving-gui license change to GPL v2.0 </p>

<p>1.7 </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR New choice of edge filter Reorganized GUI a bit around “Remove” function Added a few more tool tips </p>

<p>1.6: </p>

<p>Update to latest CAIR Removed marked button (will shrink to remove marked, then expand to original size)  HD Mode More parameters to teak hoe CAIR works CAIR performance improvements </p>

<p>1.5:  </p>

<p>Upgraded to CAIR 2.6.1 Can view images horizontal energy function as well as vertical Created a cursor when hovering over the image to represent the mark area size Retain/Remove marks are also shrunk with the image (will not disappear) You can select to erase areas marked for retain/remove </p>

<p>Features and ScreenshotsFeatures and screenshots can be found on the static Content Aware Image Resizing google page for the program. </p>

<p>Technical DetailsThe GUI is written in Qt 4, and should be capable of being built on Mac, Linux and Windows. CAIR is written in C++ and is mostly unmodified from it&#39;s source besides some hooks for progress and canceling. It depends on pthreads which are native on Mac/Linux but have a port for building on Win32 (dll included for easy building). All platforms with the proper build environment (libqt4-dev in Ubuntu, otherwise get Qt4 from Trolltech) should be able to build the application. Under Linux run qmake seam-carving-gui.pro (or under some distros qmake-qt4 seam-carving-gui.pro) and then make. </p>

<p>The Windows binary I provide is built with mingw and the mingw redistributable dll is included. </p>

<p>Platform Specific InstructionsUnder Mac OS X with Qt Open Source Edition installed (from the pre-built dmg image), you can build the application from the command line as follows: </p>

<p>$ qmake -spec macx-g++ seam-carving-gui.pro
<br/>$ make
<br/>$ open SeamCarvingGui.appTo package Qt into the application to make it relocatable to another computer, you can run </p>

<p>$ bash packageMac.shUnder Windows with MinGW, set your QMAKESPEC environment variable to win32-g++ and your QTDIR properly (usually handled by the installer). Then run the following commands: </p>

<p>&gt;qmake seam-carving-gui.pro
<br/>&gt;mingw32-makeThe executable will be placed in the &quot;release&quot; directory. Copy mingwm10.dll and pthreadVSE2.dll into the same directory to be self contained. </p>

 title : The simple-timer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an activity timer written in C# .NET. It features the global key commands, alt+spc to start/stop the timer and crtl+alt+spc to reset the time, allowing for unobtrusive and simple time tracking. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>ExplanationI wrote this timer because there were no simple timers out there on the &#39;net worth using. The total size of the EXE is less than 36kb. It utilizes the UserActivityHook class introduced on codeproject.com for the global key commands. Everything else is stock .NET. This would work great as an example of using the UserActivityHook class (everything from KeyDown, KeyPress and KeyUp usage to canceling the bubbling of events). </p>

<p>As of 1.1, users are able to run multiple instances and give them names. I also added the ability to control the timer from a context menu on the taskbar. While the timer is running, right-click on the taskbar item to use this functionality. When more than one timer is opened, global key commands work only for the first-opened timer (this is why I added the taskbar functionality). </p>

<p>As of 1.2, users can keep track of their start and stopping times using the new built-in logger. The triangle-button on the bottom slides out a log window which displays a log of starting, stopping and total times. This data can be selected using the top-left button and pasted into an Excel document for printing or reporting. </p>

<p>As of 1.3 a ton of functionality has been added while simplifying the interface. The main interface buttons all now use images in addition to text for both recognizability and accessibility. Users now can right-click anywhere on the form to access a contextual menu with preferences and new modes of operation. Timer now provides a countdown timer as well as the regular stopwatch. Switch between them using the contextual menu. Users can now also change the transparency of their timers and set them to always stay on top, as well as tell the timer to alert them at preset intervals of time. All of this new functionality and imagery has come at a small cost--the executable is now just over 110kb. </p>

<p>As of 1.4 Beta 1 I&#39;ve added the ability to save and open timers, the ability to print the timer log, the option to shrink the interface to a 120x40 box (mini-interface), a few bugs fixed and the right-click menu (the main entry point to the extended functionality of Timer) will now work on the entire surface of Timer. </p>

<p>UseKey Commands: </p>

<p>Start Timer/Stop Timer Alt + Space (from anywhere in the system while the app is running) Reset Timer Crtl + Alt + Space (from anywhere in the system while the app is running) Quit Escape (while the app is in focus) </p>

<p>To use, open Timer from your Start Menu; enter a name for the timer; and start using! You can do this with as many Timers as you need, simply rinse-lather-repeat! </p>

 title : The tweened Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main purpose of this project is to provide a very simple way to animate any Xaml Objects you want in Silverlight. To reach this goal you just have to Reference Tweened.dll in a Silverlight 2 project. You will have access to color, RenderTransform and simple propertie Animation easily with many options like AutoReverse, BeginTime, SpeedRatio . </p>

<p>It&#39;s released and maintained for Silverlight 2 or higher. In layman&#39;s terms, Tweened helps you move things around on the screen using only code, instead of the timeline.  The general idea of a tweening Class is that dynamic animation and transitions (created by code) are easier to maintain and control, and more stable than animation based on the regular Silverlight timeline. The Tweened syntax is created with simplicity of use in mind, while still allowing access to more advanced features.  </p>

<p>the general idea is to make the automatic creation of resource types Storyboard. Internally class Tween operates two Storyboards, the first is used for animation to go, the other is used if necessary to animation back. Storyboards Each of these contains a number of objects DoubleAnimation XAML. They serve as animated sequences. Each DoubleAnimation refers to an Xaml object and a lively targeted property, for example X or ScaleX. So a tween can animate lot of objects in several different equation of movement with different duration and behavior. For example a double animation could loop. </p>

 summary : <p>Construct youtube video share website easilyIntroductionThis software help you setup a cdn network for a video share website. you can upload your videos files in one server, which acts as a media center, when netizens watch videos from a vodserver,  files would transfered from a relay server to vodserver then to user player. </p>

<p>This software vodserver can be acted as vod server or relay sever, then you can add a apache or a iis as media center and upload your media files only to this media center, when netizen acess your media contents from vodservers, if vodserver has media contents, then it will give media contents to netizen, if it has&#39;nt, it will pull the meida contents from a relay server on packets. In a simple words, vodserver and relay server all has it&#39;s own cache. Try once, Your media cdn networks would run... </p>

<p>Run on all popular platforms.Such as Windows2000,WindowsXP,Windows2003,SunOS,Linux,Unix Because of based on asynch call techs,it Supports huge concurrent Http Acesses to Media File Requests(wmv,flv,mov...) Save mony in net band.Supporting config connection&#39;s download speed, for example you can limit download speed of wmv file(400kbps) in 400kbps Simple media content delivery in pull mode, so you don&#39;t care file transfer from media center to vod servers.When people demand a media file in a vod server, if this file don&#39;t exists in it, it will get this file through Relay Server. When it gets blocks of file, it sends it to people immediatly, not waiting for whole file downloaded from Relay Server. So reacts is very quickly setupconfig filefile in ini type </p>

 title : The walkmanmtp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WalkmanMTPOpen source utility that allows for the creation/modification of playlists, the addition of album art to files without embedding cover images into each file (thus saving space and eliminating redundancy).  It also allows for the uploading of video/image files.  All of this is accomplished without having to install Windows Media Player 11 (WMP10 is the minimum requrement).   </p>

<p>This is meant to be a simple way to make playlists out of files already on the player, and add files to the player without having to install WMP11 and mess around with creating a library.  It will never be a replacement for Windows Media Player, or any other kind of media manager or ID3 tag manager/editor. </p>

 title : The windows-itunes-album-art-importer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>iTunes album art importer for WindowsA command line script that imports music and album art into iTunes on Windows. </p>

<p>usage: import_to_itunes.bat -s directory directory directory directory </p>

<p>-s  Sync iTunes with the current state of the file system.  If files have been moved or deleted remove them from iTunes.   -d  Add a directory of files to iTunes.   -dr  Recursively add files within a directory to iTunes.   -r  Remove a directory of files from iTunes.   -rr:  Recursively remove files within a directory from iTunes.  </p>

<p>How it worksFor each track added to iTunes the script searches for artwork associated with the track using the following steps... </p>

<p>Use artwork with the same filename (minus the file extension) as the track.  For example, the artwork somesong.jpg would be added for somesong.mp3. If no song specific artwork exists use the first image file in the directory containing the track.  For example, music/someartist/somealbum/folder.jpg would be added for music/someartist/somealbum/somesong.mp3. If no artwork is in the track&#39;s folder each parent folder containing the track is searched for an image file to associate with the song.  For example, music/someartist/someartist.jpg would be used for music/someartist/somealbum/somesong.mp3</p>

<p>The program uses little in the way of CPU or other system resources so it&#39;s suitable to run all the time (and it only makes sense to do so).  It can be compiled under most versions of MS Visual C. </p>

<p>In the future I would like to see the source code updated for Unicode so that it can support non-ANSI character sets.</p>

 title : The jslint4java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a java wrapper around the fabulous tool by Douglas Crockford, jslint. It provides a simple interface for detecting potential problems in JavaScript code. </p>

<p>The usage is simple: </p>

<p>  % java -jar jslint4java-1.3.3.jar application.js
<br/>  jslint:application.js:11:9:Line breaking error &#39;)&#39;.
<br/>  jslint:application.js:11:10:Missing semicolon.There are a multitude of options; try --help for more details. </p>

<p>You might also be interested in the ant task.  This lets you run jslint as part of your  builds.  For documentation, see the jslint4java-ant page.  If you find this useful, you may also like the jsmin ant task for reducing the size of your JavaScript files. </p>

<p>News2009-12-02. jslint4java 1.3.3 is released.  Noteworthy alterations: </p>

<p>Add support for the predef option, to allow specifying a list of predefined global variables. Update to JSLint 2009-11-24.  This brings the devel option. 2009-11-12. jslint4java 1.3.2 is released.  Changes include: </p>

<p>Allow use of an external jslint.js. Update to JSLint 2009-10-04.  This includes a new maxerrs option. Tidy up the docs a little. My thanks to Simon Kenyon Shepard and Ryan Alberts for helping me to fix portability issues in my unit tests. 2009-07-31. jslint4java 1.3.1 is released.  This release fixes: </p>

<p>Improved support for  NetBeans thanks to Ari Shamash! Correct line numbers (previously off by one). The ant task now states the full path to the file being checked. The build failure now includes the total number of errors found. Updated to JSLint 2009-07-25. 2009-07-23. jslint4java 1.3 is released.  This release features: </p>

<p>An upgrade to jslint 2009-07-08. The indent option is now supported. Add getEdition() call. The ant task can now work with any kind of nested resource, not just files. Improved documentation. The build system has been switched to maven.  This means jslint4java is now available as a maven dependency: 
<br/>  com.googlecode.jslint4java
<br/>  jslint4java
<br/>  1.3
<br/>NB: The package names have changed from net.happygiraffe.jslint to com.googlecode.jslint4java.  The most likely place this will affect you is if you are using the antlib support. </p>

<p>2008-12-23.  Development of the code has moved to github.  Feel free to visit http://github.com/happygiraffe/jslint4java or: </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to scalaxx - scala Xml eXtensionsWe are planing to make some changes to scala.xml: </p>

<p>implement hierarchy of parent nodes add parent axis for XPath projections Evaluate Zipper approach (cf. [1], [2], and [3]) and a QName type to have typed {uri}localName (and conceivably a conversion from string to QName in these cases) prefixed / unprefixed attribute constructor functions (based on QName though) convert it to case classes (with nice wrapping functions for some default cases) IRI support (cf. [4], [5]) RelaxNG support    and then... </p>

<p>an internal dsl for &quot;mutating&quot; trees and if it is really wanted </p>

<p>the namespace map in projections solution (but I really just prefer using a proper qname for this) All these initial suggestions are originated at scala&#39;s user mailing-list, in particular, discussions with Chris Twiner, Jamie Webb, and Burak Emir.</p>

 summary : <p>XML Optimization is a set of method that reformat the XML metadata for use with XML stream. The process is used in websites to minimize network bandwidth consumption and increase the memory space for the applications who store them locally. XML metadata is used by modern applications like OpenOffice.org, GNOME, Evolution, Rhythmbox, GDM, etc., and is used in SVG graphic rendering. By Optimizing the XML metadata that those applications use, the application who parse them will require less memory usage, and less time parsing, thus improving speed and responsiveness.</p>

 summary : <p>Background of the ProjectNmap (&#39;Network Mapper&#39;) is a free open source utility for network exploration or security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. Nmap runs on most types of computers and both console and graphical versions are available. Nmap is free and open source (license). </p>

<p>Visit the Nmap homepage at http://insecure.org/nmap/ </p>

<p>The ProjectThe XML expert helps evangelize the Nmap XML format file that can be obtained after a Nmap scan . The proposed application shall have the following deliverables: </p>

<p>1. Move Nmap XML files into a database.The first version of the project shall support only PostgreSQL and MySQL. The database schema will be predefined </p>

<p>2. Compare two Nmap XML output files and producing a 3rd XML file which describes the differences (newly up/down hosts, open port changes, etc. ). This will be useful to see the change the status of a target Host at different times </p>

<p>3. A simple Command Line utility and tutorials demonstrating how to use Nmap XML output effectively. </p>

<p>Language/ tools / LibrariesXML Expert will use  </p>

 title : The xml-test Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Checks that an XML document is included in another document. It is handy when testing an application output against a document where element order is different (GData and Atom specs are examples of specifications where element order is unimportant). It has a relaxed notion of containment: </p>

<p>element order is ignored. whitespace is trimmed. comments are ignored. specific elements can be ignored by passing XPath-like paths on the command line. text nodes (element and attribute content) can be ignored by passing &#39;-notext&#39; on the command line. Only document structure is checked. You need a working Scala installation to run this program. Then you can run it like this: </p>

<p>scala -cp xmldiff.jar com.google.xmldiff.Main feed.xml feed-out.xml -i feed/totalResults feed/startIndex \
<br/>feed/itemsPerPage feed/entry/published //updated /feed/entry/contentThe above command will compare feed.xml and feed-out.xml, ignoring all updated elements, openSearch elements under feed, and content or published elements inside feed entries.</p>

 summary : <p>Years of research in ancient indian gurukulams helped to the world to understand the scertes of complex educational concepts. During those golden days of indian histroy gurukulams were called as temples of education where guru(master) is the god, and the student is the devotee and the education was treated as the way of manifestation of the perfection already in man. </p>

<p>This project is an attempt to bring the indian gurukul education systems close to the students again.</p>

 title : The icsiboost Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Boosting is a meta-learning approach that aims at combining an ensemble of weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) is a greedy search for a linear combination of classifiers by overweighting the examples that are misclassified by each classifier. icsiboost implements Adaboost over stumps (one-level decision trees) on discrete and continuous attributes (words and real values). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost and the papers by Y. Freund and R. Schapire for more details. This approach is one of the most efficient and simple to combine continuous and nominal values. Our implementation is aimed at allowing training from millions of examples by hundreds of features (or millions of sparse features) in a reasonable time/memory. </p>

<p>Here is an excellent tutorial on Boosting: http://nips.cc/Conferences/2007/Program/event.php?ID=575 </p>

<p>NEWS: </p>

<p>2010-01-24: Added Stanislas&#39; patch to display error rates based on argmax instead of sign decisions. 2009-10-19: Added a rudimentary java implementation of the classifier. 2009-10-10: Released the optimal_threshold.pl script to get a better decision threshold on unbalanced data (for binary problems only). 2009-07-29: There is now a decoder in pure python. It&#39;s quite slow (and could be optimized), but is useful for small projects in python and educational purposes. 2009-04-08 WARNING: On multiclass problems, icsiboost does not compute the error rates the same way boostexter does. This does not result in lower performing models, and an option for getting compatible values will be implemented in the future. 2009-03-30 You can now specify the type of text expert and its length on a per-column basis in the names file (previously set globally with -N ngram -W 3...). Example: &quot;words:text.&quot; becomes &quot;words:text:expert_type=ngram expert_length=5 cutoff=3.&quot; which is equivalent to -N ngram -W 5 --cutoff 3, only for that the words column. You should use the svn version to get the latest fixes (change log). do not use r96: a bug made training fail (all users should upgrade to r102 which fixes major bugs) WARNING: if you trained a model with -N ngram -W length, you have to pass the same options at test time, otherwise the related weak classifiers will be ignored (unless you specify it in the names file). Get and Compile (you need PCRE &gt;= 01-December-2003): </p>

You will have to remove blank lines, comments and add a period at the end of each lines. The data must contain a stem.data file with training examples, a stem.names file describing the classes/features and may contain a .dev and .test file that will be used for error rate computation. </p>

 summary : <p>IUP Portfolio is an education platform for Swedish schools, focused around the students individual development plan (&#39;Individuell utvecklingsplan&#39;, IUP) and learning portfolio. </p>

<p>HistoryIn 2006 Swedish government created a new law.  It said that every pupil in K-12 schools, has to have an Individual Development Plan called &#39;IUP&#39;(Individuell Utveckling Plan). </p>

<p>This plan will contain the goals that will be created in connection with parent/teacher/pupil talks that are held two times a year. </p>

<p>The purpose of having an online IUP is that all parties should be able to access the document at any time and be able to follow up on the goals that were created. </p>

<p>Goals for the IUP Portfolio projectRolled based System 2 basic views </p>

<p>Teacher Pupil/parents(separate login above grade 6) </p>

<p>Teachers viewThe first thing that a teacher sees is a matrix with students name in the rows and semester in the columns. </p>

<p>In each cell there will be of a Web form ready to be filled in by a teacher who will write down what was agreed upon during the talks. </p>

<p>This form will be separated in to this basic formulaWhere do we stand now? Where are we going? How will the home help the student? How shall the school help the student? What will the student do him or herself? </p>

<p>The result of this form will be saved in the pupil cell in his/her matrix. </p>

<p>So there are two basic matrices we want to build, one for the teacher to get an overview of all his/her pupils and one for the pupil to have a matrix for his IUP and portfolio work. </p>

<p>Pupil/Parent viewMatrix with the rows </p>

<p>Development plan &#39;IUP&#39; Documents Pictures Media </p>

<p>Columns again stand for time. </p>

<p>The IUP or development plan should appear the same way it does for the teacher. </p>

<p>The pupil and parent will be able to verify and comment the IUP from this view. </p>

<p>PortfolioThe rows for documents, pictures, media allow for uploading, viewing, and sharing, of the digital resources the pupil has gathered during the school year. </p>

<p>Other tools (In development)CalendarThe teacher will administer the calendar. </p>

<p>The pupil and the parent should see their own activities and those in common for the pupils class. </p>

<p>Chat boxThis is where the teacher will have the ongoing communication with the home. There should be a message for the teacher when there is an unanswered message. Maybe notification by e-mail. The parent teacher will only use to communicate with the teacher. </p>

 title : The marchfluxmenu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?Marchfluxmenu is an attempt to have the fluxbox menu emulate the Gnome (or XFCE) menu, in both looks and functionallity. It first generates a fluxbox menu for the current user from all the valid .desktop files  found in /usr/share/applications/ The menu entries are categorized in a similar way as Gnome menu, viz as Accessories, Games, Graphics, Internet, etc etc. The program then uses a daemon like script (mfmdaemon) to watch for changes in the directory    /usr/share/applications/ If a new .desktop file is added/removed (for installation/removal of a package), the fluxbox menu auto-refreshes to reflect the change! You can also make changes manually to the menu items (NOT the submenu names themselves, yet!). They won&#39;t be lost while refreshing the menu. </p>

<p>NOTE: mfm requires Python &gt;=2.5.2 </p>

<p>Changelogver 1.2Implemented a new icon finding algorithm for the apps appearing in the menu. Now it searches for icons  in the directories /usr/share/pixmaps and /usr/share/icons/48x48/apps. It matches the icon file names with the Icon entry in the respective .desktop files One can also add more directories easily. </p>

<p>Screenie </p>

<p>Getting startedMarchfluxmenu is written in python, which you need to have in your system. To run the GUI menu editor, fluxMenu, you&#39;ll also need pygtk. </p>

<p>Get the tarball, untar it and run the installer script there. This will create a ~/.marchfluxmenu directory where the program will be &#39;installed&#39;.The installer also generates a new fluxbox menu. The current menu will be backed up as ~/.fluxbox/menu.mfm.bak The mfmdaemon is also started by the installer. You might want to add the &#39;daemon&#39; to your fluxbox startup file as well, if you want it to run everytime fluxbox starts (Recommended!). Just add the line  </p>

<p>~/.marchfluxmenu/.mfmdaemon &amp;

 summary : <p>Today’s, Customers are smarter and more sophisticated than ever. Technology is changing. With SMS, medium of communication, students will be able to receive information on particular subjects on their phones, which is broadcasted by the lecturers through SMS gateway. The information will help them to get their studies done while they sit on the playground. SMS interface, in which computer, manages all incoming\outgoing SMS traffic. Answer the queries, comes in the form of text SMS &amp; provides information from database driven application. Customer sends SMS in specific format to organization. Alternatively, customer sends SMS from mobile phone application. Application acts as a bridge, links systems such as databases, networks or CRM to issue messages, such as alerts or notifications to any wireless device. To telephone each and every student would be both time consuming and costly. Another option would be to place the information on the notice board? However, the probability of all students checking it regularly is slim to say the least. What about email? Perhaps not the best method where even today’s computer savvy students fail to check their emails on a daily basis, what other option is there? Your answer could lay with SMS text messages. 90% of students own a Mobile phone or are in-touch with mobile owned friends. SMS alert of lecture alert and exam update can be easily distributed instantly to students. Students can receive lecture alerts, exam updates </p>

 summary : <p>The Internet became today an unbounded gate of knowledge, innovation and creativity; the only limit is our imagination. It allows people, without any frontier, to share and enrich their skills and knowledge by creating their own community. The community became for the current web a wealth that no other tools posses, it gave birth to a new dimension: the Web 2.0. Here, the user is not a simple consumer of information anymore. The information is provided to him but also an author, which makes him share his leisure activities, knowledge etc. The abundance of information the World Wide Web offers gives education one of the best performing tools because it targets a huge community. It stays very handy because the only required condition is an Internet connection. The learning is done in a complete interactive way with a single-word motto: &quot;Sharing&quot;. Thus education is inserted in a new era where each person can look further into his training or better, perfects it by a media which take more and more place in the world.</p>

 title : The open-source-physics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The continued use of procedural languages in education is due, in part, to the lack of up-to-date curricular materials that combine science topics with an object-oriented programming framework. Although there are many resources for teaching computational physics, few are object-oriented. What is needed by the broader science education community is not another computational physics, numerical analysis, or Java programming book (although such books are essential for discipline-specific practitioners), but a synthesis of curriculum development, computational physics, computer science, and physics education that will be useful for scientists and students wishing to write their own simulations and develop their own curricular material. The Open Source Physics (OSP) project was established to meet this need. OSP is an NSF-funded curriculum development project that is developing and distributing a code library, programs, and examples of computer-based interactive curricular material. </p>

<p>You are free to use Open Source Physics source code or compiled programs consistent with the GNU GPL license, but please note that the narratives of books and manuals associated with OSP code are usually copyrighted by their respective authors and/or publishers.

 summary : <p>NOTE: as with any active project, OpenNERO is a work in progress and many updates are frequently being made. If you have trouble with OpenNERO, check the discussion group and then consider submitting an issue. We also welcome any helpful comments or suggestions on this site or the platform at opennero-questions. And of course, if you would like to contribute, let us know! </p>

<p>About OpenNEROOpenNERO is an open source software platform designed for research and education in Artificial Intelligence. The project is based on the Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game developed by graduate and undergraduate students at the  Neural Networks Research Group and Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. </p>

<p>In particular, OpenNERO has been used to implement several demos and exercises for the Russell and Norvig&#39;s textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.  These demos and exercises illustrate AI methods such as brute-force search, heuristic search, scripting, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation, and AI problems such as maze running, vacuuming, and robotic battle. The methods and problems are implemented in three different environments (or &quot;mods&quot;), as described below. </p>

<p>More environments, problems, and methods, as well as demos and exercises illustrating them, will be added in the future. The current ones are intended to serve as a starting point on which new ones can be built, by us, but also by the community at large. If you&#39;d like to contribute something you have built, you can reach project managers at opennero-questions. </p>

<p>Getting startedYou can download a binary build of OpenNERO for your platform, or checkout the current source and build it yourself. You can then try out the various demos, work on the exercises, or explore the various mods on your own. </p>

 summary : <p>SummaryThis project provides an api for working with sensors in Java.  The current focus of the project are sensor devices mainly used in education.   </p>

<p>Some vendors that provide sensor devices used in education: </p>

<p>Vernier Data Harvest  Fourier Pasco </p>

<p>The ProblemAll of the vendors of these sensor devices provide software for working with their sensors.  Most of this vendor software allows writing activities or labs which use the sensors.  But if an author uses this approach, their activity or lab will only work with one vendor&#39;s sensors.  Within a district or even a school there can be multiple types of devices from different vendors.   </p>

<p>Part of the SolutionThe org-concord-sensor api provides a solution to part of the problem.  It allows a programmer to work with these sensors independent of which device is actually being used. To completely solve the problem, the api needs to be embedded inside of a content framework so authors can create activities which use the api. </p>

<p>There are open source implementations of the org-concord-sensor api for Vernier LabPro, and Vernier Go! Link.  There are closed source implementations for some of the other devices. </p>

<p>The DetailsThe wiki pages for this project are currently located here: http://confluence.concord.org/display/SENS/Sensor+Device+System Some of those pages are out of date.   </p>

 summary : <p>ABOUTpygpslog is a GPS logger for S60  smartphones that uses Nokia&#39;s internal location and landmarks API and thus can co-exist with other navigation applications (e.g. Nokia Maps) running at the same time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s features include </p>

<p>Record data in standard GPX or OziExplorer format. Easy marking of waypoints (with or without confirmation). Easy marking of six different track segment types (e.g. speed limits). The usual: Data view, Satellite View, Compass View... Simultaneous logging and navigation (e.g. with Nokia Maps). Integration with Nokia&#39;s landmarks. </p>

<p>But best see the Screenshots below. </p>

<p>WHAT&#39;S NEWPlease see the History page. </p>

<p>LICENSEsee LICENSES and COPYING 
<br/>REQUIREMENTSA device running S60 3rd edition. An internal or external GPS device. Python for S60, v1.4.2 or higher. Versions 1.9.x and higher are not supported at this time. You may get it from SourceForge. 
<br/>If you&#39;re new to Python on S60 it&#39;s probably better to read the 
<br/>PyS60 Wiki first. 
<br/>The LocationRequestor module (see below!). The Landmarks module (see below!). All installation files have to be Symbian Signed by yourself in order to be really useful. Please see the DOCUMENTATION The LocationRequestor module above is packaged with an UID that cannot be used for Symbian&#39;s Open Signed process. Therefore I&#39;m making a  re-packaged version available here. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Landmarks module, as of Mar. 7, 2008, contains a few bugs that prevent it from working with pygpslog. Until I receive word from the authors, you may download a patched version from this site. </p>

<p>In fact, the LocationRequestor and Landmarks modules are not absolutely required to run pygpslog, but the functionality will be severely limited. Please see below. </p>

 title : The revolutionary-elearning-in-singapore Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Traditional teaching methods of developing academic materials have resulted in &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;. Therefore, there is a need to utilize the open source model to assist educators by creating a repository of materials freely available to all. </p>

<p>1. Introduction </p>

<p>Rationale: Despite the aim of education being common enlightenment, it is not uncommon for schools in the competitive education market to hoard educational resources. Many schools have developed excellent teaching resources and methods only to “waste” them by granting exclusive access to this invaluable material. Therefore, we suggest the adaptation of the Open Source Development Model, with its hallmarks of innovation and openness, to build an open repository of academic material would promote cooperation between educators, as well as providing an economical alternative to commercial textbooks. </p>

<p>Overview of Project: This project places great emphasis on the sharing of materials, as well as constant updating and improving teaching materials by the various schools in Singapore so as to provide freely available academic material for use by students and teachers. In order to achieve the objective, I studied the current practices of the Open Source Model. Also, I investigated how Open Source managed to involve various users in the development of computer code and how I can propose to adapt these practices to the education community. </p>

<p>Proposed Plan: To meet the needs of the Education Community, it is proposed that a central repository be set up, to serve as an official platform for public cooperation to develop free (“free” as in free speech, not free beer) material. It is recommended that the repository be based online.  </p>

<p>Organizational Structure:  Ideally, the repository would be under the stewardship of the Ministry of Education (MOE). To ensure the smooth running of the repository, a dedicated permanent team should be set up. The proposed organizational structure is as follows: </p>

<p>Active Users:  This group of people makes up the bulk of the contributors. They are members of the public not affiliated officially to the project. Regardless of their educational background, they are all qualified to make relevant contributions to the repository. </p>

<p>Permanent Editors: They are qualified teachers employed by the MOE. They are responsible for going through public contributions to the repository. Upon receiving public contributions, they evaluate suitability of the contributions for inclusion in the repository. Additionally, they are in charge of maintaining the repository, making suitable amendments to ensure the information stays relevant and rectify errors identified by users.   </p>

<p>Project Leader: The Project Leader is a dedicated member of the Permanent Editors. While the Permanent Editors may be regular teachers and only work part time on the repository, the Project Leader’s sole responsibility is to oversee the running of the repository. The Project Leader’s approval must be obtained for large overhauls to any section of the repository. Additionally, the Project Leader, having the fullest view of the state of the repository may call to attention any parts of the repository that need more development. </p>

<p>2. Project Needs: I encouraged qualified teachers and A level students to join in to develop this online repository so that the entire Singapore education community can benefit from these resources and thus, improve the quality of Singapore&#39;s education. Finally, it aims to replace the current blackboard system that requires a login password and username.</p>

 title : The schizophrenia Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Schizophrenia is a mental illness defined in 1911 by Eugene Bleuler.  Its symptoms in psychiatry include: Hallucinations Delusions Paranoia Depression Suicidal Ideation </p>

<p>Treatments  </p>

<p>Acupuncture, -pressure, aromatherapy, biofeedback, biomedical devices, cognitive behavior therapy, counsel, education, electroconvulsive therapy, herbs, mental hospitalization, massage, meditation, natural supplements, pharmaeutical drugs, prayer, Qi Gong, reflexology, religion, Tai Chik, walks, yoga </p>

<p>Dr. Abram Hoffer used injections of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide and reported a 80% recovery rate in his book &quot;Adventures in Psychiatry&quot; </p>

<p>Antipsychotic drugs are used, classified a- or typical. Well known examples include: typical: haldol atypical: olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, paliperidone </p>

<p>Side effects may include: weight gain, obesity, diabetes, tardive dyskinesia, tremors, involuntary movements, bradykinesia, excess salivation, drymouth, migraine, headache, skin damage, liver damage, neuroapoptosis, incontinence, edema,   </p>

<p>They are thought to act by blocking dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and other brain receptors in chemical synapses, a gap between neuron processes (axon or dendrite) where neurochemicals cross a synaptic cleft, couple with a receptor, and cause a small excitation of electric potential. Sum together, and a nerve impulse, action potential, occurs. Antipsychotics can clog 50-80% of dopamine receptors. </p>

<p>Recovery rates on antipsychotic drugs are about 25% for 1st episodes, and moderate improvement for 50%, no recovery for 10%, including suicide. </p>

<p>NAD+ is a coenzyme found in the glycogenolysis of glucose for ATP production in the brain. Vitamins, such as niacin, niacinamide increase availability of NAD+, and have been used for schizophrenia treatment.  </p>

<p>Organisms require water, carbohydrates, fatty acids, protein, vitamins, minerals, nutrients, temperature, excretion, air, stimuli; </p>

<p>the former 7 are found in food, their quality and quantity can have a large impact on mental health. Consider biochemicals in food as construction pieces disassembled via digestion, reconstructed in bodily organs and tissues. Their composition (eg protein type) can alter brain chemistry, and neurochemical, -transmitter, -peptide proportion, affecting homeostasis, experience, mood, thought, behaviour and indirectly, belief. </p>

<p>Social relations and education have an impact on health, esp. food quality, wealth, and intellect. Chronic schizophrenia has higher rates in homeless, poor, and intellectually undervalued people.   </p>

<p>It is thought NAD injections could increase health of a recent psychotic episode, for use until body health, genetic, environment, toxin, nutrition changes and socioeconomic improvements. </p>

<p>Improved welfare, balance of wealth, social status, and better community integration may lead to improved societal health and wealth. </p>

<p>Philosophical considerations: </p>

<p>Philosophically, however, hallucinations, delusions and paranoia may be a result of misinterpretations by observers, scientists, psychiatrists, nurses, staff and others. New phenomena may be real, and not mistakes of our nervous systems. Examples: paranormal, ESP, telepathy, mindreading, religious, unexplained scientific phenomena.  </p>

<p>Brains may be evolved that its electric charge has undiscovered and undervalued practical consequences on environment and people. We may be more powerful than we realize. </p>

<p>Psychologists, mystics, laypeople can at times hallucinate with conscious choice. Using 10% of our brain suggests we have unrealized potential for higher intellect, e- E, electrostatics and others.   </p>

<p>Neuroscience research may benefit from patients, in difficulty, opportunity. Ethics and treatment compliance and cooperation issues. </p>

<p>A majority of hallucinations reported are not associated with schizophrenia.  </p>

<p>Anhedonia suggests better modes of treatment could increase life satisfaction. Experience is subjective. </p>

<p>Altered states of consciousness implicated in modes of genius or insanity may be useful for neuroscientists, self or others, improving knowledge of complex systems, mathematics, psychology, neurology, cognitive science, epigenetics. </p>

<p>Epigenetics indicates our thoughts can slowly recode and alter our genetic expression. Out thinking depression, stupidity, mania, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders    may be possible in part. </p>

<p>Dr. Abram Hoffer suggested schizophrenics have longer life spans, a resistance to cancer through increased production of adrenochrome, a hallucinogen. The Hallucinogens, Adventures in Psychiatry. </p>

<p>What is it? Why would a person report hallucinations if what we experience is all there is? How could one know it is a hallucination, delusion, paranoia? </p>

<p>Is paranoia a form of diligence? </p>

<p>Are there virtues or results of schizophrenia that can benefit mankind? </p>

<p>Why are many geniuses, relatives schizophrenic? </p>

<p>Are there strange results of nature from schizophrenia? </p>

<p>Why God, Allah, Buddha has created illness? </p>

<p>Why do healthy schizophrenics have long life spans?</p>

 title : The spellnow Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a school assignment, and I am releasing the code that I am creating under a GPL license to the public. </p>

<p>News08/05/2008: I now have a working, in use copy of SpellNow at SWIFT-online.net. SWIFT is a spelling tutoring program that my school runs, which is what I had in mind when I started making SpellNow. I will be using Swift Online to aid in spelling learning, but this is along side many other activities already in place (SpellNow will just be a side note). This is using PHP, and I will be committing the source to SVN once I am happy with what I have. </p>

<p>Also, in regards to licensing. The source code of SpellNow is freely avaliable under GPL 3. There is a difference between the source code and content. I will not be releasing the content (spelling words, audio, maps, story, images etc.) under GPL, so it will need to be licensed out. Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use these items, it just means it will be different to the source code. It will be free for home use, but will be licensed out at a very reasonable rate to schools which are using it to assist in education, which is only fair. The source code is useless without the content, unless you re-write your own content into the source code, which is currently rather difficult, but will be re-done soon. </p>

<p>30/04/2008: SpellNow is back in development! I am going to use it at school now as a learning aid for a spelling program that I am a tutor at, so I will be adding more features. </p>

<p>17/11/2007: It has been a long time since I posted here. Sorry about that! As you may well have noticed, a PHP extension did not come about, as of yet, but I still have plans for it. The C++ version has been canned, and replaced by spellnowPy, a Python version. The Python version will be actively developed from now on, with no major features or changes for the web based version (planned). The PHP version will hopefully work with the spellnowPy version, to allow a database to be used. </p>

<p>The Python version will use wxPython for the GUI (Graphical User Interface), and I plan to have it as interactive as possible, with many more features to come. </p>

<p>I cannot give a date for when these are released, but I will continue to work on SpellNow into the future. </p>

<p>30/08/2007: Expect a PHP extension/add-on avaliable for download soon, and within the next month (September), a new release (0.78). </p>

<p>31/07/2007: Today my SpellNow assignment was due at school. I handed in a working copy with a few things I had finished 1am the night before. I am releasing this version as a normal version (as apposed to aplha or beta). Please download spellnow0-32.tar.gz. See the wiki page SpellNow032Release. </p>

<p>21/07/2007: Wow, it has been a little while since my last release. It has been a bit over a week since I got back from Tonga, and that went for 2 weeks. Anyway, a quick update. I am working on the same practice page as before (it is getting better), and have fixed the bug so it will now display the score at the end of the list, not the word before. I have also moved a few things around as well as touched up a few things. I am also working on a new menu page, to make it easier to select a level. I have a few other things planned before the final thing is released. I am currently in a different state, so I can&#39;t easily upload to SVN without my home computer, but I will when I get home. </p>

<p>22/06/2007: I have released the first alpha of Spell Now! It is called alpha 233, and you can download here: spellnow-alpha233.tar.gz. </p>

<p>NotesI am trying to keep this project as open source as possible, but there are a few things I cannot help. Firstly, I am forced to use mp3 for the file format, as I am using a program called Sound Manager to play the sounds, which uses (another closed format) flash to play the sounds. If I can find a way so that I can play it in OGG and without flash, I will do that. </p>

<p>Currently, I am working on the word lists, so they aren&#39;t fully up yet. The word database included could really be counted as a extra, as one that big isn&#39;t really required for my assignment, but it is needed to make it usable. </p>

<p>AboutThis is a spelling program, designed to help improve the spelling of Junior School Kids (Grade 2 to 5). This is fully customizable, and can be adapted to any learning environment. </p>

<p>Currently, as part of my Information Software and Technology assignment, I am required to make a educational JavaScript program. I am also planning to release a PHP addition to it, which isn&#39;t required, but will be able to run on a server and remember student details (previous results, name etc,). </p>

<p>LicenseImportant licensing information (additional to GPL): You are allowed to use this program free of use, but you must NOT, under any circumstances, remove any of the credits any where in this software. I reserve the right to change the license at any time, and if you are using the software, at any version, it is assumed that you will comply with the new license or stop using the software. </p>

<p>You must purchase a license if you are to use this software in a classroom, within a for profit organization (if you are registered as a non-profit organisation, you can use this software free of charge). This is due to the fact that SpellNow is back in development and more features are being added. This only applies to versions AFTER 0.32. For licensing information, please visit http://joshhendo.com/spellnow </p>

<p>If you are using this software in a classroom or learning environment, please email  to let me know that you are using it, and how many students are using it. IF you could also let me know any improvements or features that you or any students would like to see in it (or any BUGS that have been found, those are very important to know about), please let me know. I want to be able to make this the best possible. It isn&#39;t required to email me, but if you do, I will email you about new licensing information or any other important information about this (the latter won&#39;t be emailed upon request, though licensing info will be if changed). </p>

<p>Other ProjectsMany other people will know me from the project BitFox, which is a BitTorrent Firefox extension. That is a project I am doing under my own will. I will be working on it later in the year, but this project is a school assignment, so it is guaranteed to be finished early term 3 (in Australia, which would be by the end of July), while I am not getting as far with BitFox. </p>

<p>I have mentioned this because some people may think that I will start projects and not complete them, but this one I am required to complete.</p>

 title : The ufo-language Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UFO is a general-purpose multi-paradigm functional programming language with some very high-level features. Some of the more specific features make it quite suitable for creating other programming languages and computational models (abstract/virtual machines). It includes: </p>

<p>automatic memory management a number of high-level concurrency constructs with garbage collected threads extensive pattern matching capabilities easy to use syntax (it is not a curly-brace-and-semicolon programming language) strong, dynamic typing lots of built-in data structures even more! The UFO language borrows heavily from just about every functional language in existence, most notably Scheme, Postscript, Erlang, Haskell, ML, Oz, and probably a few others. </p>

<p>The language is being developed in Modula-3 using the CM3 compiler. </p>

<p>The language is currently in the alpha stage (March 2009), so I am not releasing any source code.  Once it reaches the beta stage I will provide the source code here.  I anticipate that happening Real Soon Now (TM), which is why I have created this web page. </p>

 title : The w-profiles Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Basic Terms: </p>

<p>Let online profile be the page (or the fragment of a page) that contains some kind of user identification  and private data. Phones, names, photos, dating info, cv, hobbies,  teaching courses may be the part of such a profile. Assume that user create such a online profile by profile-template, means he chooses appropriate form (the set of input fields) somewhere and fills this with his own data. This form (creator) needs to create an html  page with microformat / eRDF  annotations. Thus user will get an page that looks like an ordinary html page, and its source code will  be marked with special notation to  find out  interested data fragment easily (using xpath).  </p>

<p>Let derived profile is the special facet of online profile, means it contains the subset of the data from the main one. The following derived profiles may usually be introduced: DATING derived profile, OFFICIAL derived profile, HOBBY derived profile, FORFRIENDs derived profile.  </p>

<p>w-profiles are both online and derived profiles which state (management) is supported by special services and technologies (see below).  </p>

<p>Basic assumption: </p>

<p>I suppose that user will have (or already had) a homepage where his identity data is located. Nowadays user  used to have a page at linkedin / facebook / moikrug services to manage and publish online profile. If it is necessary  to publish such a data online,  they need to recopy data (in most of them), or embed and card means an little HTML/AJAX fragment that will fetch the main account and show the last data.  </p>

<p>This project concentrates on this usage (creating and manage online profiles) and has the following accents </p>

<p>w-profiles needs to be decentralized system.   w-profiles needs to be inter operable. Easy to integrate in any system (including Security, Identification systems) and static page.  w-profile needs to be user centric. Easy to create, maintain, exchange.  </p>

<p>AIM: </p>

<p>Service will help to create and manage online profiles,  separate online profile to the set of facets (derived profile), and allow to create card  (as external and up-to-date view to derived profile). </p>

<p>USER STORIES Profile Creation Story  </p>

<p>user asks the service to provide online or offline creator of his profile page.  user found an profile-template (on special wiki) or derived from the known one.  user gets the html code of the profile and store it locally. User uses the special (online or offline) software  to create an number of Derived-Profile. User needs to easily perform such a derivation.    user uploads the derived profiles  somewhere to the web. User inform the w-profile  service (ping it) and provide it with the  location of this profile.  </p>

<p>  Profile Using Story  User want to embed an widget (little card) of his derived profile somewhere to the web. He asks w-profile service to give him this AJAX/HTML code.  </p>

<p> Profile Management Story  if user want to change all the embedded data (card) it needs to change only derived profile. All embedded cards will be changed automatically. </p>

<p>Look to the extended user stories  for detail.  </p>

<p>FUTURE USE The target using of this technology is to provide a basic space  for OPENID and  TRUSTID management data embedding.</p>

 title : The advancedscheduler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims to be an Autosys compatible framework for control of enterprise job streams. Jobs may be scheduled based on time, as well as on the status of other jobs. This allows for fine-grained control over job streams -- especially compared to cron and other simple time-based schedulers.  </p>

<p>While the short-term goal is to be Autosys-compatible, the ultimate goal is to provide innovative facilities that Autosys does not, and to remove several of the artificial constraints placed on users by the AutoSys product.  </p>

<p>It will implement an similar user interface, when feasible, in order to avoid a high learning curve and excessive changes to existing monitoring and reporting infrastructure. </p>

<p>The blog, linked at right, is a good source of information on what work is being done, work planned for the near future, and general project direction. </p>

<p>HighlightsAccepts most existing Autosys JIL Autosys compatible interfaces make migration easier Developer- and integrator-friendly.  Easy-to-understand database schema and command-line utilities.  Completely implemented using F/OSS technology, such as PERL and Postgres, so ADS is easily maintained, low cost, and highly customizable.  Clients are kept as simple as possible, so re-implementing or porting to a new platform should be fairly straight-forward. Most logic is implemented in Postgres, so it works on any platform that supports Postgres.  Features currently implementedConditional scheduling logic No limits on job name length Reads and persists many common JIL fields to Postgres, even if they&#39;re not yet implemented.  Scheduling based on start_mins and start_times, start_days, and job conditions. insert_job, update_job, delete_job commands Many common features of sendevent, autorep, and jil utilities implemented. std_out_file, std_err_file, and std_in_file. &quot;std_in_file&quot; is an ADS extension of JIL. Ability to switch ADS databases via environment variables Agent runs configurable number of job executor threads. This allows you to throttle the number of concurrent jobs running on each machine.  Job &#39;namespaces&#39; are compatible with Autosys idea of &#39;Instance&#39;, except that it gives a few other advantages: No more scoping by prepending the system to the job name.  Large installations with multiple streams often name their jobs following a convention like GROUP-PRODUCT-real-job-name. Now you can set your namespace to GROUP-PRODUCT and simply use real-job-name as your job name.  If you&#39;re really stuck on the idea of an Autosys &quot;instance&quot;, just set your namespace to the autosys instance name for compatibility. This means you can combine multiple autosys instances on one database. Planned FeaturesWill allow distributed job management using multiple master database servers for better scalability.  Autorep output will support parser-friendly formats, like YAML and XML, in addition to the familiar autorep format.</p>

<p>The tool should have wizards for common security related use cases ,such as login, change password, authorid access, etc... The tool should combine these security tests to generate a custom set of security tests for an application. </p>

 summary : <p>Calao: a new way of working togetherCalao helps people working together by sharing information and coordinating actions through a web interface. Create tasks for your workmates and keep notified of their progress! </p>

<p>Here are typical Calao use cases: </p>

<p>An office secretary requests employees to fill in a form, for instance a timesheet for the elapsed month. She gets notified once all forms are filled-in, and simply relies on the system to automatically notify late persons. A sales manager requests a sales representative to work on a specific lead. The manager gets notified of the various associated events until the lead is closed: phone calls, documents received, etc. A project manager schedules and assigns tasks to project members and monitors their completion as users report the work done on their own tasks. </p>

<p>Calao provides the following fancy features: </p>

<p>Task notifications: Calao notifies concerned users upon task events: when a task is assigned, when it starts, when it gets completed, when it is late, etc.; Task attachments: notes or documents can be attached to tasks at any time to further share information with workmates. Worktime estimates: the system can learn from reported activity and provide worktime estimates for new tasks. Automatic scheduling: Calao can schedule tasks automatically based on priority and people availability.  Planning views: Work planned can be viewed as a Gantt chart or as a per-person worktime breakdown. Unlimited workspaces: new workspaces can be created to cater for specific workgroups, each workspace having its own user directory and storage. And probably more to come! </p>

<p>Project is currently in very first stage. It is basically a major rework from Calao original version by SIGNAL25 toward a more mature, open-source framework capable of supporting future extensions.</p>

<p>Status (May 09)Most of the back-end work is almost complete, so I will soon be able to concentrate on the actual booking side of it. In the mean time, please feel free to check out the demo of the development progress. </p>

<p>ContactGoogle Groups Directl email: craig dot rodway at gmail dot com RequirementsApache (mod_rewrite optional) PHP4/5 with GD MySQL 5 FeaturesEliminate double-bookingsIf a room is already booked by somebody or is used for a timetabled lesson, no one else can book the room for that period. Only administrators, and room owners and booking creators can cancel bookings. </p>

<p>Unlimited rooms and usersManage as many rooms and add as many users as you like. </p>

<p>Easy-to-useThe simplified user interface makes all relative information available at a glance and makes it easy to see which rooms are available to book, and when. </p>

<p>Custom timetableNot everybody has a single week timetable with fixed one-hour lessons. This is why we allow administrators to create their own timetable, with their own weekly cycle and lesson times to match the school. </p>

<p>Cross-platformNo executables, DLLs, runtimes or plugins are required. As it&#39;s web-based, a modern web browser is all that&#39;s needed for users to book rooms.</p>

<p>Writing XML documentation comments in .NET can be troublesome sometimes because you can&#39;t really see what it&#39;s going to look like - you have to compile the code, then take the extracted XML doc and feed it to a rendering engine like Sandcastle, then wait for the compiled help to come out so you can read it. </p>

<p>有少部分情况，除了翻译 *.wml 文件外，还需要翻译与之配套的 *.po 文件。注意看 chinese/Bugs/index.wml 文件中有如下一行: </p>

<p>#include &quot;$(ENGLISHDIR)/Bugs/pkgreport-opts.inc打开 *.inc 文件，找到 bind-gettext-domain 那一行，记住 domain= 后面的内容。例如在本例中被 Bugs/index.wml 引用的 english/Bugs/pkgreport-opts.inc 文件的 domain= 后面的内容是 bugs，剩下的工作就是对 chinese/po 目录下的 bugs.zh.po 进行翻译。假设 domain= 后面的内容是 vendors，那么剩下的工作就是对 chinese/po 目录下的 vendors.zh.po 进行翻译，以此类推。只有如此才能看到完全中文化的 w.d.o/Bugs 页面。在翻译 po 文件时一定要注意，除了保证该 po 文件的编码格式为 BIG5 以外，还请务必确认该文件 Content-Type 那一行的 charset 等于 BIG5。通过 enca 命令可以检查某个文件的编码格式。 </p>

Dr.ta is a implementation program, ased on sctp protocol and IHU (I Hear U) project, of MOD. It integrates the voice/text and supports multi-network communication.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We can imagine that Car PC will become standard equipment on every car in the future. There are a vehicular wireless network interface, which provides an unreliable and cheaper communication path, and a 3G network interface, which provides a reliable and more expensive communication path, on every Car PC.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, the passengers can communicate with each other by using vehicular wireless network interface in advance. When the distance between two cars is greater than a predefined threshold, the wirelss communication will become unavailable. And Dr.ta will change the path to the reliable communication path and maintain connection automatically and seamlessly.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dr.ta will return the connection from a reliable path to an unreliable path, automatically, when connection of the unreliable link is available again.</p>

 title : The goldilocks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When you set security barriers, most often your goal is to keep an intruder OUT of your stuff. Goldilocks is a system that allows you to set various levels of perceived access, giving you far more information on what the attacker intended had they been granted access. By spoofing common services, an attacker who believes they have gained access to your system, can be tracked as they issue dummy commands. Think of it as a managed honeypot for wargames or diagnostic security. </p>

 title : The google-calendar-connectors Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Google Calendar Connectors are a set of services that allow Google Calendar to interoperate with Exchange 2000, Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2007 servers through the bi-directional sharing of Calendar Free / Busy information. Each of the tools is installed in the local Exchange environment and must be maintained / configured by an Exchange Administrator. </p>

<p>January 22, 2010: Version 1.3 has just been released. </p>

<p>This open source project is a developer and partner release and is not targeted for direct  customer or end-user installation.  The Google Calendar Connectors represent a set of tools and should not be considered native functionality of Google Apps Premier &amp; Education Editions. </p>

<p>Google Calendar Connector Web Service: This connector allows users in Google Calendar to see free/busy information for users who maintain their calendars in Exchange. It is a .NET web service that takes requests sent from the browser with Google Calendar and returns free/busy obtained from a Microsoft Exchange 2003\2007 server.  Google Calendar Connector Sync Service: This connector allows users of Microsoft Exchange to see free/busy information for users who maintain their calendars in Google Calendar. It is a Windows Service that periodically queries the Google Calendar GData API to get updated free/busy information and publishes this information as free/busy information in Exchange.  Notice: The Google Calendar Connectors represent a set of tools for interoperation, and not a self-contained solution.  Bi-directional free/busy scheduling requires a Google Apps Premier Edition domain which has been enabled for calendar interoperability. </p>

 summary : <p>The groovy-guice project enables you to use Groovy script files and Groovy source files as binding targets in Guice. Ease of use and minimal amount of code for configuration were the design goals. </p>

<p>Simple examples are given inside Javadocs of this project and there is a Junit testcase in the source.  </p>

<p>You should consider using groovy-guice, if you want to use Groovy power, but you have to wrap it or want to call it from within java.  </p>

<p>currently supported features: </p>

<p>compilation of class/script files at runtime compilation of code inside a String at runtime configurable recompilation of changed class and script files  URLs as part of classpath @Inject is fully supported for resolved Groovy classes OSGi </p>

<p>changes in version 0.4.0 </p>

<p>Modules written in Groovy can now be added during module installation time. New methods were introduced for this feature. Please have a look at UserGuide for the current API usage. API from version 0.2.0 was removed. Some methods are now deprecated in GroovyGuice. Expect them to be removed within next major release. added some convenient methods to GroovyGuice. </p>

<p>changes in version 0.3.2 </p>

<p>requires now Guice 2.0 due to some changes in final Guice 2.0 release, the integration with Guice and therefore the API of groovy-guice had to be refactored. Please have a look at UserGuide for the current API usage. As a nice side effect of this refactoring, the API is now much smaller. old API of release 0.2.0 is scheduled for removal within release 0.4.0 </p>

<p>maintenance release 0.3.1 </p>

<p>switched dependency for guice to org.guiceyfruit.guice-all 2.0-beta-7 due to interface changes in guice SPI package, this release is NOT compatible with earlier versions of guice (org.guiceyfruit.guice-all 2.0-beta-6 and earlier or guice20090415 and earlier) </p>

<p>changes in version 0.3 </p>

<p>this release is a complete overhaul old API based on annotations is completely marked as deprecated and expect it to be removed after the next release introducing a fluent API class loading was also overhauled requires now Guice 2.0 (tested with 20081116 and 20090205) tested with groovy 1.5.7 and 1.6.0 supports OSGi now old API uses also new backend, so it should work also on OSGi installations, but this feature is not tested little support was added for peaberry for OSGi integration from this release on, a maven2 repository is provided for groovy-guice recompilation can now be handled transparently by groovy-guice. No need to inject a Provider, use the recompilable class as a &quot;normal&quot; class! </p>

<p>changes in version 0.2 </p>

<p>added new annotation GroovyResolve whether groovy classes should be resolved or not added new annotation GroovyCodeBase apply security permissions from .policy files to Groovy scripts an example PolicyFile is provided in Wiki</p>

 summary : <p>Strategic and secure information sources are naturally becoming key repositories that customers want to make searchable. Since search is a platform and not just an application commodity, it is a pre-requisite to cope with heterogeneous security systems in order to seamlessly roll-out an Enterprise-wide secure search capability. </p>

<p>The search appliance can nicely integrate with popular single sign-on (SSO) systems, forms-based authentication systems and negotiate HTTP Basic and NTLM authentications/authorizations. However, it can’t substitute the need for a unified authentication process across all secure sources. Heterogeneous sources may require different sets of credentials which make the search experience painful for the end-user, having to authenticate multiple times when querying. </p>

<p>Additionally, the appliance may not be able in certain cases to cope with complex and non-standard authentication and/or authorization processes which may put at risk the deployment of search technology. </p>

<p>The GSA (Google Search Appliance) Valve Security Framework was designed to answer both of these issues. It exposes a global authentication capability to the search user and then loads transparently the sets of credentials that are relevant to each indexed sources. It is a framework that can easily be extended to support the specifics of new repositories in terms of authentication and authorization processes. </p>

<p>This authentication and authorization framework acts as a content proxy and can be considered as a quick, simple and low-cost alternative to a single sign-on (SSO) system. It can be integrated as well with third-party SSO solutions in those situations where the corporate SSO doesn’t secure all the searchable applications. </p>

<p>It offers two different interfaces to be integrated with the appliance: Forms Based and SAML. You can use any of them using the GSA integration features. </p>

<p>You can use Authentication/Authorization modules created by third party contributors. There is a file in the download area that includes the current ones, like the Oracle Portal module. These modules don&#39;t have anything to do with the connectors provided with the GSA Connector Manager &lt; http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/ &gt; as they have different purposes. </p>

 summary : <p>Propose a new security plugin for Symfony that handles resource level and more... </p>

<p>With sfGuardPlugin, it&#39;s easy to manage permissions for a collection of resources. But what about restricting access to a sub-collection of resources or even to a particular one ? For instance, if you want to restrict the view to all the news, a credential news_view is well enough. But if you want to restrict the same operation to the news of category 2 or directly to the news 53 ? That&#39;s the main purpose of isicsACLPlugin. </p>

<p>Another goal is to add a new customization level for end-users. With Symfony basic security system, it&#39;s the developer that tells if an action is secured or not (security.yml config file). With isicsACLPlugin, the end-user will be able to define directly if an operation on resource is: </p>

<p>OverviewJavaSpaces Netbeans project is aimed mainly at students of Computer Science learning Linda concepts. The goal of the project is to provide a set of plugins for Netbeans IDE that turn working with JavaSpaces into a pleasure and make it easy even for Java beginners. When using JavaSpaces Netbeans one can concentrate on logic of the program instead of tinkering with the technology itself. </p>

<p>All Computer Science students of Warsaw University have to learn Linda as a part of an obligatory course (Concurrent and Distributed Programming). Thanks to JavaSpaces Netbeans project the way Linda is taught will change dramatically - instead of solving problems on the blackboard or pieces of paper students will be able to program their solutions in Java and Netbeans IDE. Besides, they will be able to test their programs with the help of a specialized debugger. </p>

<p>JavaSpaces have been around for quite a long time, yet they are not widely used - mainly because of their crude interfaces for administering tuplespace instances and complicated configuration. Despite this, as one of Linda implementations they are a very interesting and powerful technology which facilitates writing distributed and concurrent programs. Processes operating on tuplespaces created in JavaSpaces avoid many problems related to synchronization and data exchange. Thanks to dynamic code downloading, through a JavaSpace we can pass not only data but also behaviour among groups of processes, possibly operating on different machines in the network. This feature makes JavaSpaces much more expressive than plain Linda. </p>

<p>Configuring and running JavaSpaces by hand is a complicated problem - they require lots of work to set everything up. And once something doesn&#39;t work correctly, you need expert knowledge about Jini, RMI and JavaSpaces itself to fix the problem. At the same time, if we forget about tiresome configuration and untidy Jini code necessary to get hold of JavaSpace instances, JavaSpaces programs turn out to be extraordinarily simple. The example code written in the environment provided by the JavaSpaces Netbeans project is very simple. What is even more important, it can be run with no more effort that running a typical Java application with a main method. </p>

<p>Thanks to the functionality JavaSpaces Netbeans project provides, you can not only run and test famous Dining Philosophers problem, but also write a complex compute server - a distributed computing environment that is incredibly scalable and extensible in comparison to traditional interprocess communication techniques like RPC. </p>

<p>A library for the eve-online api.What is libeveapi?libeveapi is a library designed to simplify working with data from the Eve-Online API. The library handles requesting data from the api along with caching and parsing the result. </p>

<p>CachingEvery response from the Eve-Online API includes a &quot;cacheUntil&quot; directive. After the first request for some data the library will transparently cache the response until the &quot;cacheUntil&quot; time is reached. The library manages the cache transparently. All you have to do is load the cache file when your application starts up and save it before your application shuts down. </p>

<p>Securitylibeveapi does not save any authentication information (apiKey, userID). All responses are cached using the SHA1 hash of the request url. For added security you have complete control over how the cache is saved. If you are working with sensitive data from the API then you are free to encrypt the cache in any form you choose. For more information see Security. </p>

<p>Using the LibraryFor detailed explanations and examples see the documentation. </p>

 title : The livelocations Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Live Locations (LL) is an Android service for finding your contacts.   </p>

<p>Live Locations has two features, linked with each other. </p>

<p>The First feature is that LL ties into your phone via your GTalk contacts and the phones GPS service.  When a contact sync request is made by your phone to google, LL will also update your location to the Live Locations Service, hosted on Google Appengine. </p>

<p>At the same time, LL&#39;s second feature will make a request to the service to request all your contacts (you have permission to recieve) last know locations.  If they have LL installed, then your contacts screen will be updated with this. </p>

<p>From here, you can click on the location (similar to what you can do with their address) and a map will appear with this location shown.  This means you can see where your friend is and find directions to them.  Great for meeting up in unfamiliar locations. </p>

<p>The idea is not to replace the existing contacts manager, but to improve it by adding this location-based feature, so it can become a popular service by being unobtrusive. </p>

<p>In future versions you will also be able to make your position public via a web interface, and there are plans to look at adding additional services (Fireeagle, Brightkite, Twitter, etc). </p>

<p>The service runs on a Google Appengine backend.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a collection of command line security auditing scripts for Linux/Unix.  Originally by Sean Boran in 2000, with a few improvements over the years. </p>

<p>Auditing the security of an existing system can be time-consuming, and often requires on-site visits. There are several commercial tools and a few free ones that help, but they can be complicated and require local compilation or configuration. </p>

<p>So a tool was developed with the following aims: </p>

<p>Simple to use: the auditor could even give the tool to the sysadmin, ask him to run it at night and send the results back to the auditor (perhaps by encrypted email). For situations where a &quot;quick audit&quot; of the system is required. Easy to verify: it is not as thorough as other tools, but it is small and easy to understand. Does not require a compiler or other tools. Support several Linux and Unix derivatives </p>

<p>This script automates the gathering of the information only. Of course, the difficult part is the interpretation of results and deciding what countermeasures to take. </p>

<p>Please visit http://code.google.com/p/lusas for the current documentation. The previous doc is on http://boran.com/audit </p>

 summary : <p>Our aim with parcl is to create a content management system with very little overhead and taking modularity to a new level with creating everything non-essential to safely and automatically loading the modules into modules. To achieve this we use PHP5 and its object oriented programming capabilities for the script itself. The InnoDB storage engine for MySQL to achieve better database integrity through its ACID compliance and XSL Transformations for the template system. AJAX implementation through the jQuery java script library is also planned. </p>

<p>Of course will all output be XHTML 1.0 Strict (or XHTML 1.1 if the browser supports it) and CSS2.1 valid, using UTF-8 encoding and there are accessibility implementations on the horizon.</p>

<p>REGOLA (non è un) Framework, </p>
 summary : <p>This idea of mine is to lock a computer remotely via a GSM service etc using a biometric device by its user so that he can protect the computer at the top level security. As hackers cant directly access the servers to steal data because of the hardware and software firewalls, their primary choice of attack would be on terminals. This project will pay attention to the corporate level mainntainance and also by an individual if deserved. There would be a GSM service that communicate with the computer remotely ie., wherever the user is, through a proper biometric device. With the key press, he will be able to stop the power supply flow into the motherboard from the SMPS so as to prevent the system from getting on. Similarly, he will send another signal to start the computer working normally and the lock gets released. For this to work, we need a device to communicate with the biometric gadget in the user hand and, control the computer. This device must be able to sit in the cabinet itself and the power for it is the CMOS battery that is existing in the computer itself.</p>

 title : The security-nadav-gil Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Design a home and industry based security systems using VHDL.. Could be used for sensoring temperature changes,motion detector,water-level sensor,fire sensor,back and front door detection etc.... </p>

<p>VHDL has been at the heart of electronic design productivity since initial ratification by the IEEE in 1987.For almost 15 years the electronic design automation industry has expanded the use of VHDL from initial concept of design documentation to design implementation and functional verification. It can be said that VHDL fueled modern synthesis technology and enabled the development of ASIC semiconductor companies. </p>

<p>The use of vhdl has evolved and its importance increased as semiconductor devices dimensions have shrunk. Not more than 10 years ago it was common to mix designs described with schematics in favor of the hardware description language only. </p>

<p>The fact that VHDL is adaptable is a tribute to its architecture. The industry has seen the use of VHDL’s package structure to allow designers, electronic design automation companies and the semiconductor industry to experiment with new language concepts to ensure good tool design and data interoperability. When the associated data types found in the IEEE 1164 standard were ratified, it meant that design data interoperability was possible. </p>

<p>The design community continues to see benefits as the electronic design automation community continues to find new algorithms to work from VHDL design descriptions and related standards to again push designer productivity. And, as a new generation of designers of programmable logic devices move to the use of hardware description languages as the basis of their design methodology, there will be substantial growth in the number of VHDL users. </p>

<p>The VHSIC Hardware Description Language is an industry standard language used to describe hardware from the abstract to the concrete level.VHDL resulted from the work done in the ‘70s and early ‘80s by the U.S Department of Defence.Its roots are in the ADA language, as will be seen by the overall structure of VHDL as well as other VHDL statements .VHDL usage risen rapidly since its inception and is used by literally tens of thousands of enginners around the globe to create sophisticated electronic products.VHDL is a powerful language with numerous language constructs that are capable of describing very complex behavior. </p>

<p>In 1986,VHDL was proposed as an IEEE standard, It went through a number of revisions and changes until it was adopted as the IEEE 1076 standard in December 1987.The IEEE 1076-1987 standard VHDL is the VHDL used in this book.All the examples have been described in IEEE 1076 VHDL,and compiled and simulated with the VHDL simulation environment from Model Technology Inc.The synthesis examples were synthesized with the Exemplar Logic Inc. synthesis tools.  </p>

<p>The Ada language is the result of the most extensive and most expensive language design effort ever undertaken. Up until 1974 half of the applications at The Department of Defense were embedded systems. An embedded system is one where the computer hardware is embedded in the device it controls. More than 450 programming languages were used to implement different DoD projects, and none of them were standardized. Because of this, software was rarely reused. For these reasons, the Army, Navy, and Air Force proposed to develop a high-level language for embedded systems. </p>

<p>By 1977, a complete language design specification for Ada was created. In April 1977, four proposing contractors were chosen to produce Phase I of the language design. In February 1977, Phase I of the language design was complete. Following this, was a two month evaluation period where 400 volunteers in 80 teams chose two out of the four as being the best language designs. These two companies were then given the go ahead to produce Phase II of the project. At the end of Phase II, another two month evaluation period took place. In May of 1979 the Cii Honeywell/Bull (the only foreign contractor) language design was chosen as the winner. Phase III of the project began after the winner was selected. After a winner was selected, the language design was published by the ACM. In November 1979, over 500 language reports were received from 15 different countries. Most of the reports suggested minor changes in the design, none real drastic. Based on these suggestions, a revised language design was published in February of 1980. After some minor changes to this document over the next few years, the final official version of the language was settled upon. The Ada language was then frozen for the next five years </p>

<p>Ada is a comb-structured, statically typed imperative computer programming language designed by a team led by Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell Bull under contract to the United States Department of Defense during 1977–1983. Ada addresses some of the same tasks as C or C++, but Ada is strongly-typed (even for integer-range), and compilers are validated for reliability in mission-critical applications, such as avionics software. Ada was named after Ada Lovelace, who is often credited with being the first computer programmer. </p>

<p>Synapse will be a platform and online code-vulnerability scanner that pro-actively educates software developers that write software for the Internet by inspecting their software, and notify them of code flaws. Synapse will be able to inspect all software packages released on the Internet that is freely available and under any GNU type-off license on a special dedicated webserver. Synapse will spider the free software portals and retrieves all software for inspection. Synapse will investigate the code and upon finding a flaw it will enter the vulnerability into a database ready for triage by either manually labor through a syndicate feed, or further processing which involve real-time automated software testing. Synapse will be able to notify the software developer automatically with a report generated on the results. Synapse then offers the software developer with different choices. One will be that the developer will get general advise on how to fix the issues, the other will be to get in contact with a skilled programmer or company that can advise the programmer or solve the problems for a fee.</p>

<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-- Rodney Thayer, ÜberHaxxor</p>

<p>The mobile phone industry is expected to ship something on the order of 935 million phones in 2006, half of which will be so-called &quot;Smart Phones.&quot; This number is expected to double in  five years. Some of these phones will run Windows Mobile; some will run Symbian. But even if only 1% run some variety of Linux (a la MonteVista) or L4 (a la Qualcomm) that&#39;s still something like 20 million linux devices shipping in 2011. That&#39;s quite a few Unix based devices running around a wireless network.</p>

<p>Handset manufacturers, network operators and some corporate IT departments have fallen down on their responsibility to develop secure products in the past. But Basil II / Solvency II in Europe and Sarbanes-Oxley in the United States have raised awareness of IT security as a cross-cutting concern across an increasingly global business community.</p>

<p>The industry is looking for tools and techniques to limit the financial risk of exposure of corporate secrets or loss of assurance over the firm&#39;s financial control processes. In other words, corporations on both sides of the Atlantic are being asked by regulatory regimes to prove that their IT resources are resistant to assault from malicious attackers.</p>

<p>After being taken on a confusing ride on the &quot;PKI express&quot; in the late 1990&#39;s, IT consumers are interested in security again. But this time around they&#39;re looking at &quot;global&quot; technology solutions that create a &quot;secure end-to-end experience.&quot; In the previous tech-cycle, corporate IT departments gained extensive experience with VPNs, Firewalls, PKIs, SSL, SSH, and basic key management. But the &quot;Dot Com&quot; era ended just as mobile device and web application security solutions were maturing.</p>

<p>Now that we find ourselves in something that looks like a recovery, it&#39;s time to start focusing on the harder problems of securing mobile applications.</p>

<p>Traditional Unix-like operating systems use the concept of the &quot;user&quot; as the basic subject for security policy decisions. An application&#39;s ability to access resources such as files and devices is based on the User ID it is running as. This was great for multi-user servers with tens, hundreds or thousands of concurrent users whose files must be protected from accidental (or malicious) access.</p>

<p>While user-mediated security enforcement for mobile applications is necessary, it is not sufficient to properly represent security policy for mobile devices; devices that traditionally have a single primary user.</p>

<p>The XeroBits project is an attempt to develop a toolkit for mobile device security. It is released under a BSD license with the hope that the more &quot;corporate friendly&quot; terms will encourage it&#39;s adoption by handset manufacturers, network operators and enterprise customers.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; you ask, &quot;but what it it?&quot;</p>

<p>XeroBits includes primitives that may be used to establish the origin of bits of code. The kernel may then use this information in an access-control decision, mediating access to a file descriptor, network socket, device or even a CDSA-style  key repository.</p>

<p>XeroBits contains tools and libraries for:</p>

<p>* Digitally Signing Executables and shared object libraries
<br/>* Establishing an &quot;appropriate&quot; level of trust when shared object libraries from different protection domains are dynamically loaded into the same executable image.
<br/>* Generating and authenticating opaque tokens (think SASL here) that testify as to the inclusion of an executable in a given protection domain. This provides non-kernel processes with the ability to make access control decisions based on a subject&#39;s protection domain.
<br/>* Generating and authenticating opaque tokens based on stack-based attestation (a la NGSCB/Palladium.) This gives kernel and non-kernel processes the ability to make access control decisions based on the call-graph that led to a kernel trap or IPC call.)
<br/>* Remotely managing device security policy
<br/>* Protection domain specific and application specific secure out-of-process storage of shared secrets, secret keys and private keys.
<br/>* &quot;Out of process&quot; encryption, signing, decryption and verification using references to managed keys.
<br/>* Digital Certificate life-cycle management. This relieves application programmers of the requirement to maintain certificate meta-data.</p>
 summary : <p>This project is part of a directed study project at Kennesaw State University under Dr. Alan Shaw. The purpose of the project is to make education more interesting and to make students more interested in Computer Science. One of the goals of this project is to create a virtual world where students can create their own robots with A.I. and fight other robots in tournaments. Even though one of the main goals of the project is to create a game-like environment, another goal is to create an engine out of this for others to use. </p>

<p>My plans for the engine include: Using C++ to write the server and the client Using the networking library enet (http://enet.bespin.org/) Using OpenGL with SDL underneath it for the graphics and input/output. (http://www.opengl.org/) (http://www.libsdl.org/) Eventually include Python or some other scripting language like lua for the objects that are in-game. (http://www.python.org/) (http://www.lua.org/) Possibly implement some sort of protocol that will make communications between the clients and the server more efficient. At some point down the road, figure out how to include artificial intelligence.</p>

 title : The android-tabletop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NewsAfter completing prototype for ADC, I took some time to review architecture, study similar projects, etc. As a result, I changed a lot of things. In fact, only most basic code and architecture remained, everything else has changed. So, It will take some time before project will be back in a &quot;playable&quot; state. I&#39;ll update source, code, description etc. then. </p>

<p>ConceptThis is a graphical interface for playing tabletop and tabletop-alike games. It is a lot like XChess or XBoard. But it is not limited to only chess. It is a set of tools, that allow to easily teach it to work with virtually any  game that can be played on a table with boards, pieces, cards, etc. </p>

<p>Architecture basicsThe core of this application consist of two parts - game model and it&#39;s visual presentation. </p>

<p>GameModel is designed in a way, that will allow easily adjust it to different kinds of games and different kind of play styles (one player, several remote players, ai, game server, etc). </p>

<p>VisualEngine is designed to present current game state engine on a screen of Android phone and to interact with it. It represent game as a set of interactive game accessories - pieces, boards, card decks, dices. Simple XmlFormat is used to make creating new game environments easy. </p>

<p>DemonstrationTabletop.apk is a demo application, that demonstrates some of engine capabilities. You can choose chess of draughts game boards (see menu). Moves you do are stored to a file in real time, so you can exit application at any time and when you relaunch it you will have same position as when exited. </p>

<p>To move a piece, click on it, and then where you want to place it. You can take new pieces from palettes  atthe bottom of the screen and frop there unneeded pieces to remove them from game. </p>

<p>It also can be used for solving chess puzzless, like 8 Queens. </p>

<p>    </p>

<p>Further developmentBesides some usability and performance tweaks, following features are currently in work and are planned to be finished in immediate future: </p>

<p>Interface for choosing file to store games, copying games, etc. Networking and multiplayer - it&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s not present already, but I spend too much time polishing other components. With that it will be finally a complete application, in addition to just a framework. It will be a P2P oriented model - no need for trusted server, just direct data interchange. Support for games with a chance and hidden information. Card decks, dices, that sort of thing. That will require implementation of fair play enforcing algorithms - Mental Poker, etc. Trans-application interface - it will allow controlling Tabletop fully from other applications. It can be used for making AI&#39;s, writing specialised network interfaces, etc. LicensingDemo and engine are licensed under GPL v3 license. Code is licensed under New BSD license as well. </p>

<p>From Andy Peatling, creator of BuddyPress </p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble finding any time to work on BuddyPress so I&#39;ve decided to hand over what I have to the community for help. 
<br/>There are three Wordpress MU plugins here, each should be dropped into the &quot;mu-plugins&quot; folder. The &quot;core&quot; plugin should also be used, and is required for all the other plugins to work. </p>

<p>Please note: These plugins are not ready to be used for anything other than further development! You should not use them on your public website. I&#39;m only making them available so that other developers can continue working with them. </p>

<p>Simple 3D engine that uses OpenGL for graphics, OpenAL or SDL for sound and SDL for other comunication with OS (threads, input, initialization). </p>

<p>It is meant to support huge levels (at most 20x20 km). Terrain is specified as heightmap, buildings and character use Quake3 BSP and Quake2 MD2 formats respectively. As it is strictly layered it should ease integration of networking code and split for client-server model (maybe suitable for MMORPG?) which is planned in near future. </p>

<p>The engine is meant to be cross-platform, running at least on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and Windows. However, the development occurs on GNU/Linux, so the development version may not compile on other platforms.</p>

<p>Every participating computer gets one EasyshareFS volume. This volume shows every file in every EasyshareFS volume on the local network. Essentially, all Easyshare FS volumes form one big &#39;file cloud&#39; which every user is shown. And every user can access all files in the file cloud as if they were local files. </p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re thinking: &#39;Mac OS X has AppleShare (AFP) already. Why shouldn&#39;t I use that and be done with it?&#39; To get the answer to that question and many more, please visit our FrequentlyAskedQuestions. </p>

<p>At least, that is the goal of this project. EasyshareFS is still in the early stages of development, and nothing has been released yet.  </p>

<p>Hardware InformationUltimately, the target hardware for the project is the Nokia n8x0 handheld (the n800 and the n810). These devices run a customized version of Debian Linux, using the Maemo application framework. They include built-in wifi connectivity and an integrated camera. Eventually the devices will connect to the EEL&#39;s ad-hoc mesh wireless network, and use OpenVPN to connect back to the IST network. </p>

<p>Software DevelopmentInitially, development will be done for standard x86 systems, and the task of porting the application to the Maemo framework will be done when the code is in a more usable state. Code is written in C, and we use GTK+ and Glade for UI development, and Gstreamer to implement video/audio streams.</p>

 summary : <p>Call this an experiment if you will. What happens when you place a bunch of strangers into a virtual world with no rules, no morals, and almost no limits? As the citizens of this virtual world the city, its government, and its economy are in your hands. Kill for a living, mine gold to create money, barter, sell your soul to the local gang, the choice is yours! Your options are only limited by the selection of skills that are available for you to learn. Quests are no longer limited to kill X number of rats but are now player created and the selection of quests will never be the same at any one time! Would you rather stay away from fighting? Well then every great city needs to have those people who sell them land! Join the realty guild and get discounts on land then turn around and sell the land for a profit. Or is politics more your style? Learn the political climate of the city and run for governor or start your own city and be the mayor better have people you can trust though taking care of the military side of protecting your city cause I hear that the black market has some big city destroying weapons for sale! However in the end what you are, what you do, and what you are known for is up to you and you alone! </p>

<p>Empire Productions could use you! </p>

<p>About Empire Productions: It is the mission of Empire Productions to create fun, inovative virtual worlds that players of all ages can feel a part of.

<p>The current version of Gatsb is hosted at gatsb.com and is maintained by Andre de Cavaignac (http://www.decav.com) </p>

<p>More InformationAfter publishing Gatsb and receiving a few users, but not having time to contribute towards it, I have decided to release it as open source so other users can contribute or take pieces and build something new. </p>

<p>This project demonstrates .NET 3.0, Workflow Foundation and ASP.NET Ajax.  It is a great demonstration of connecting Wofkflow Foundation to a text message interface and keeping a &quot;text message session&quot; open. </p>

<p>In addition, it demonstrates how to create a database of geocoordinates, how to do some geotagging, and also demonstates the use of the Microsoft Virtual Earth Maps (I tried to use Google maps but the developer API wasn&#39;t working right on localhost!) </p>

<p>Although I&#39;d love to say the code is beautiful, it was written in spare time and there are certainly some hacks in there to just get it working and up.  Forgive me if you get confused :-) </p>

 summary : <p>Our aim is to create a platform for building a social networking web application for leagues, guilds, teams and other groups of gamers. </p>

<p>Taking all the best features of sites like 1up.com, the IGN network, xbox.com, steamcommunity.com and combining them into an open source web application will give gamers a quick and easy home for hosting their leagues, guilds and teams. </p>

<p>Here are some of the top features: </p>

<p>user accounts based on email multiple game aliases track all your handles for each game alias permissions will allow only friends or everyone to see your individual aliases tracks any game (if game module doesn&#39;t exist it uses a generic game module and you provide the data) links data from other game sites like xbox live and steam  based on the .net framework initially built with MS SQL but plan to support MySQL in the future</p>

 title : The gmod-plugins Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Aims to provide various Lua based plugins for Garrys Mod 10 to expand usability, namly in networking and scripting efficiency.</p>

<p>12/27/2006
<br/>Welcome to gmod-plugins.  Currently we are still in the planning stages but hopefully we&#39;ll have some more detailed information about our scripts available.  Until we have a proper site, this area will serve as a news hub.</p>

<p>There are two main projects in the development stage right now, GMTalk and GMEdit, a GMod based Google Talk client and ingame script editor respectivly.</p>

<p>GMTalk is currently on hold due to the lack of socket support in GMod 10 and a lack of SSL support for the Lua Socket library.  The only way to currently log in and send a message is to auth using the X-GOOGLE-TOKEN.</p>

<p>GMEdit is also on hold as there isn&#39;t great support for advanced GUIs in GMod 10.  It shouldn&#39;t be that hard to work around though.</p>

<p>Projects will be graded for completeness based on the following system:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Phase 1: Planning
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Phase 2: Development
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Phase 3: Beta
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Phase 4: Release</p>

<p>12/28/2006
<br/>Not actually a GMod plugin, but could easily be ported to it, 0byte is a chat server backend I have been working on for another project.  The foundation is almost fully functional, requiring minor tweaks and some more functionality past just sending messages.  With minimal work, it could be converted to a privatized, &#39;members only&#39; chat server for GMod 10.</p>

 title : The greenvex Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GreenVexOpen Source proxy written in Python. Simplifies interacting with Battle.net protocols. Allows the creation of bots and tools for Battle.net by monitoring, sending, and receiving packets.  </p>

<p>Python is an interpreted language, therefore the source code can be executed without re-compilation (on-the-fly changes). </p>

<p>Currently supports: Diablo II. </p>

<p>Features a plugin system, and many functions to make bot development easier. Creating, testing, and running plugins is quick and easy. </p>

<p>Features a protocol system to extend handing of Battle.net protocols for the server and client. </p>

<p>Redesigned Python version of RedVex. It acts as a portal between your computer and Battle.net servers. It accepts and sends your client packets to Battle.net, then accepts and sends Battle.net&#39;s packets to your client. </p>

<p>At the moment primarily designed for Unix based systems. Versions for Windows have been compiled, which merely wrap the Python run-time interpreter into an executable. </p>

<p>Created by Eric Muyser. </p>

<p>Changelog08.11.02: Disabled library compression (causing issues). </p>

<p>08.11.02: Added a quick GUI, and fixed up the source for Windows. </p>

<p>Todo- Possibly rewrite the protocol handler structure. </p>

<p>- Fix the event listener. </p>

<p>- Take consideration for disconnections in the multiplexer. </p>

<p>- Write client plugins login/cdkey/etc and a corresponding GUI. More packet handling. </p>

<p>- Add all the GUI features. Plugin list, live Python interpreter, start/stop, realms/ports, run multiple plugin setups (multiple bots essentially) - set realm/ip address/cdkey/etc, mac address changer. </p>

<p>- Convert game packet decrypt functions into Python. </p>

<p>- Convert map parser into Python. </p>

<p>DescriptionRise of the Turkey is a 3rd Person 3D platformer in the spirit of family friendly adventures. Players control Bernie, a young Turkey wishing to complete his rite of passage into adult hood by navigating the heavens and find the great Phoenix Gate. Navigating the heavens is no easy task for Bernie and the players, as the path is not complete and is blocked by many obstacles. Bernie must create his own paths, using the Cloud Gun to form bridges and absorb “light” clouds to break obstacles. Absorbing clouds also replenishes Bernie’s limited water supply (the resource that allows him to create clouds), allowing him to progress through levels. In addition, the player will be able to compete against other players via a network connection in a timed trial to the finish line. </p>

 title : The innerspace Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to InnerSpaceInnerSpace is a MUD-like system for building virtual worlds. The goal was to take the LambdaMOO approach to creating online worlds, and update it in hopes of attracting new players to an old idea. </p>

<p>Like many MOO-clones before it, InnerSpace uses Python as its internal scripting language. This provides a powerful environment for game authors, while a flexible object model allows for creation of complex in-game objects. </p>

<p>Since the primary client is a XHTML web interface, authors can customize the client appearance a great deal using standards-based XHTML and CSS -- even JavaScript or Macromedia Flash can be embedded. </p>

<p>Feature SetAJAX-Enabled Client </p>

<p>The default client provides a standards-compliant web interface based 
<br/>on the Nevow Athena AJAX framework. </p>

<p>Client API </p>

<p>A Twisted Perspective Broker interface is provided for developers 
<br/>who with to build a custom heavy client. </p>

<p>Powerful Natural-Language Parser </p>

<p>The built-in interpreter parses a large number of different imperative 
<br/>statements, making user-world interaction a more immersive experience. </p>

<p>Internal Scripting </p>

<p>A Pure-Python scripting layer integrates tightly with the framework code, 
<br/>allowing a high degree of customization. 
<br/>   Robust Networking InnerSpace relies on the Twisted Python and Nevow frameworks to implement 
<br/>client-server communication. This robust asychronous networking library 
<br/>allows client connections to scale easily to hundreds of connections. </p>

<p>Graphical Object Editors </p>

<p>Programmers and authors alike will find the built-in authoring tools 
<br/>expedite world creation and verb programming. </p>

<p>Syntax-Highlighting Verb Editor </p>

<p>Verbs are created in-game, through an embedded editor. Support for 
<br/>external editors coming soon. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that InnerSpace in its current form is not targeted to one particular game genre or type. Owing to its roots in LambdaMOO, the goal here is to provide a basic environment that takes care of the common features of these kinds of systems. If you&#39;re looking for something with a richer set of primitives for immersive text-oriented gaming, you should have a look at Divmod&#39;s Imaginary. </p>

<p>Try it Out!I&#39;ve installed a test server on bubblehouse, but it&#39;s going to be awhile until it can be opened to the public. However, I&#39;m very interested in finding beta testers to put this thing through its paces. If you&#39;re interested in mucking around with the beta server, you should sign up for the InnerSpace mailing list. Once subscribed, you can submit a request for an account there; eventually I&#39;ll have a form or some other mechanism to allow users to create their own accounts. </p>

<p>This is the code repository of the silver group.</p>
 summary : <p>This is the project home page for the MyISERN Web application.   </p>

<p>The objective of this project is to create a social-networking web application for the International Software Engineering Research Network (ISERN). With this social networking site, a member may add, edit, and display members of the ISERN community. It also allows the same functionalities for its members&#39; organizations.  Most importantly, it facilitates collaboration among ISERN members by allowing a user to create collaborations with other members of the network.  Member information is kept confidential from the public as login is required. </p>

<p>Team Onyx has chosen the Apache Derby Database to store information provided by ISERN members.  A new ISERN member can be added to the database with the edd function.  A member may also add a new Organization, as well as create a Collaboration between another ISERN member.  The edit function allows a user to edit information for a researcher, an organization, or a collaboration.  The user is able to view information for members, organizations, and collaborations of the network.  The application must also able to create an XML representation of the information stored in the database. </p>

<p>MyISERN is able to authenticate a login/logout process as well as add, edit, and  display the Researchers, Organizations, Collaborations of the ISERN network.  Implementation is nearly complete for the use of the Derby Database to store the saved information.  We are using Java to implement the web application and the Stripes web application framework to work with the web application.

 title : The neptune-network-emulator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Neptune Network EmulatorThe aim of this project is the development of a flexible, multi-user, virtualization-enabled network emulator, using a cluster of general purpose (x86) machines: network nodes are virtual machines running on top of cluster physical machines. All nodes are GNU/Linux ones, and link emulation is implemented by netem.  </p>

<p>The emulator interface is web-based and uses the AJAX pattern. An example of net topology definition through the Neptune&#39;s Web Interface is here:  </p>

<p>More examples are in ScreenShots. </p>

<p>Actual features: </p>

<p>Users management Experimemts life cycle management (definition, allocation, destruction) Hypervisors and Virtual machines management Two ways to define topologies: xml file or visual editor Automatic topology validation and completion processes </p>

<p>What I need to use Neptune?Neptune is a cluster-based emulator, but you don&#39;t need a cluster to use it, because it&#39;s flexible!! All you need is a PC with the Xen Hypervisor,libvirt and an application server like tomcat installed and ready to use. If you have a cluster, instead, you can use the whole cluster or a part of it, simply installing on a node the above configuration and on the other nodes the Xen Hypervisor and libvirt. </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionNoX is and idea that came to me when I was initially showing Ubuntu to a new user. The conversation went something like this:  Me&gt; &quot;and this is the mail client .. &quot;  User&gt; &quot;hot damn that&#39;s ugly&quot;  </p>

<p>and it dawned on me that, well, it is.. and functionality wise it&#39;s just not keeping up with it. then again to be fair neither are MS or Mozilla products. So i decided to write my own.  </p>

<p>NoX is designed to fit into the MVC pattern, to be modular in development, and  integrated in use. Why can&#39;t I click on the contact name and be taken to that contact in my contacts tab. why can&#39;t i see my contact&#39;s facebook, twitter, friendfeed etc. statuses right there in the application. why can&#39;t i be notified when one of my contacts has updated her blog. for god sakes why isn&#39;t rss implemented properly! </p>

<p>then there is the look of it. Current mail clients seem hell bent on being dreary. </p>

<p>ImplementationClearly I can&#39;t implement this all by myself. Luckily most of the libraries are already written and the API&#39;s for social networking are simple and established.  </p>

<br/>x.03   twelve weeks 
<br/>x+1.0  20 weeks

 summary : <p>What started as an April Fool joke by Google for 2008 is now a real and genuine effort to create ideas for ways in which humankind can live sustainably in space using free and open source technology. This project is a place for all space enthusiasts to cooperate on simulations of space habitats and a related knowledgebase and tools for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using Jython and other JVM languages. Rather than argue whether L5 or Mars or the asteroids or the Moon or the rings of Saturn should be humankind&#39;s first space settlement, we could be asking what is common between those efforts so that that groundwork can be shared. </p>

<p>The proposed first design/simulation is a utility space pod. The &quot;shirtsleeve&quot; utility space pod is probably common to all space efforts. See: http://code.google.com/p/openvirgle/wiki/SpacePod</p>
 title : The opponet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Opponet is an open source effort to create components and tools for support of opportunistic wireless networking in the OMNeT++ discrete event simulator. We provide a NodeFactory component which uses traces to dynamically instantiate mobile nodes during a simulation run. Two distinct models are supported: Mobility and contact trace based. Mobility traces consist of create, destroy and waypoint commands. Contact traces consist of create, destroy, contact establish and contact break events. OMNeT++ simple modules are embedded in the mobile nodes. These are TraceMobility and ContactNotifier which handle mobility and contact events locally for each mobile node during its lifetime. Both TraceMobility and ContactNotifier inherit from the BasicMobility base class of the Mobility Framework (MF) and can thus be used in existing simulations which utilize the MF. </p>

<p>The project is described in  </p>

<p>Helgason, O. R. &amp; Jónsson, K. V., Opportunistic Networking in OMNeT++. First International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques for Communications, Networks and Systems (SIMUTOOLS 2008), OMNeT++ Workshop, 2008. 
<br/>The paper is available on the downloads page. </p>

<p>UsageThe most convenient way to start experimenting with the trace driven approach to mobility and contact support is to build and run the Opposim simulator. This is a very simple simulator which demonstrates our node factory and associated component. </p>

<p>We also provide a number of tools for generation of traces and conversion of existing traces into our format in the MobiTrace toolbox. </p>

<p>Opponet is an academic project and based solely on our interest and past research projects. The code is released under a GPL license and is free for all to use within its terms. We encourage you all to try the code and are interested in receiving feedback, either by email or though the issue tracking system (requires a google account). We are also very interested in recruiting some collaborators for the project. </p>

<p>Latest News:For Christmas I just got a new Zune 8 to replace my lost Zune 30!  I will soon be continuing this project to its very-near completion. Sorry for the long delay. </p>

<p>TetraZune is nearing completion, with the title screen now complete.  Scoring is really the last thing to add (including score totalling, high score listings, and name entering).  I have not decided yet if I will allow the wireless transfer of high scores, we will have to see how long the other stuff takes. </p>

<p>Alpha release 0.1 is available on the Downloads page (or the &quot;Featured Downloads&quot; pane to the right &gt;&gt;&gt;).  Only the main game logic is working, and the program quits as soon as you lose, without totalling your full score.  Still it is the first stable release that lets you play a full game of Tetris!  Whoo hoo! </p>

<p>Projected Features:Full working tetra block game with bonuses, cool animations, and &#39;1337&#39; sound effects. Basic media functionality. High scores and other notable achievements. Clean, professional presentation, animated effects, and overall quality. Possible utilization of wireless multiplayer, most likely only to share high scores. Overall demonstration of key components needed to making games on the XNA platform. Donations?You really love tetris? Want to see me devote more time to Zune games?  You&#39;ve just hit the lottery?  Donate!  Any amount is appreciated.  Leave a message with your gift if you&#39;re feeling really saucy ;) </p>

<p>Easy donations with Paypal.  Every dollar helps! </p>

 summary : <p>UOFAP is in essence a utility for use with the Ultima Online client. It is not a cheat program or a tool for connecting to third party servers, you may be interested in Razor if this is what you are looking for. </p>

<p>UOFAP does however work with third party UO servers, and is how we do the majority of our testing. </p>

<p>This solution covers a set of libraries and designs to be used for plug-ins for the actual UOFAP program or for people to use in their own projects. </p>

<p>UOFAP will be supplied with certain plug-ins such as a mapping tool and a chat tool, to hopefully replace the now unsupported UO Automap. Plug ins are modular, and can communicate with each other, allowing plug-ins that add extra functionality to other plug-ins (such as the mapping tool). </p>

<p>Users will get the most from the Quick Start Guide and developers will get the most from the Solution Overview. </p>

<p>wnetscan will find any wireless adaptor installed and use it to find all wireless access points in range. It will then use the information from this scan to set up the wireless adaptor and its network configuration file to connect to one of these networks. </p>

<p>Normally wnetscan will attempt to connect the network it finds with the strongest signal since this is generally the closest and the one most likely to be the one desired.</p>

 summary : <p>OverviewThis is a Java API for communication with XBee/XBee-Pro series 1 (802.15.4) and series 2 (ZNet 2.5 and ZB/ZigBee Pro) OEM RF Modules, in API mode.  The objective of this project is to provide a flexible and simple to use API to interact with XBee radios.  In terms of flexibility, the goal is to not constrain you to a particular implementation (e.g. GUI, Web App), but instead let you decide how to use it.  This software has been tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux and can run on any other platform that supports Java 5 or greater and RXTX. </p>

<p>News5/10/09 Version 0.5.5 is available and includes many updates.   See ReleaseNotes for details. 3/29/09 I have released XBee Arduino.  This is a port of XBee API to the Arduino platform, allowing you to send/receive packets on Arduino. 1/29/09 I have released XBee XMPP.  This project is built on XBee-API and uses XMPP for remote communication with an XBee network.  This allows you to share an XBee with multiple applications, that can exist on different machines. 1/25/09  Version 0.5.1 of the XBee API is now available.  This release contains two bugfixes.  See ReleaseNotes for details. 1/17/09 Version 0.5 8/3/08 Version 0.4 6/10/08 Version 0.3.1 4/29/08 Version 0.3 4/5/08 Initial Release DocumentationDeveloper&#39;s Guide Javadocs Wiki Docs  </p>

<p>ExamplesHere are a few examples that demostrate some common functionality: </p>

<p>Turn on an I/O port on a remote Series 2 (ZNet/ZB Pro) XBee: </p>

<p>XBee xbee = new XBee();
<br/>xbee.open(&quot;COM5&quot;, 9600);</p>

<p>// this is the Serial High (SH) + Serial Low (SL) of the remote XBee			
<br/>XBeeAddress64 addr64 = new XBeeAddress64(0xa, 0xb, 0xc, 0xd, 0xe, 0xf, 0, 1);</p>

<p>// Turn on DIO0 (Pin 20).  5 is Digital Output High
<br/>ZNetRemoteAtRequest request = new ZNetRemoteAtRequest(addr64, &quot;D0&quot;, new int[] {5});</p>

<p>xbee.sendAsynchronous(request);</p>

<p>ZNetRemoteAtResponse response = (ZNetRemoteAtResponse) xbee.getResponse();</p>

<p>if (response.isOk()) {
<br/>    System.out.println(&quot;Successfully turned on DIO0&quot;);
<br/>} else {
<br/>    System.out.println(&quot;Attempt to turn on DIO0 failed.  Status: &quot; + response.getStatus());
<br/>}</p>

<p>// shutdown the serial port and associated threads
<br/>xbee.close();
<br/>Receive I/O samples from a remote Series 1 (802.15.4) XBee: </p>

<p>XBee xbee = new XBee();		
<br/>xbee.open(&quot;COM15&quot;, 9600);
<br/>			
<br/>while (true) {
<br/>    RxResponseIoSample ioSample = (RxResponseIoSample) xbee.getResponse();</p>

<p>    System.out.println(&quot;We received a sample from &quot; + ioSample.getSourceAddress());	
<br/>			
<br/>    if (ioSample.containsAnalog()) {
<br/>        System.out.println(&quot;10-bit temp reading (pin 19) is &quot; + ioSample.getSamples()[0].getAnalog1();
<br/>    }
<br/>}There are many more detailed examples included in the code for both ZigBee and 802.15.4.  Here are just a few: </p>

<p>This example contains a few sample configurations to get your ZigBee coordinator and end devices configured quickly, without needing X-CTU (windows only) ZNetApiAtTest.java </p>

<p>Example of sending packets from a ZigBee coordinator to an end device ZNetSenderTest.java </p>

<p>This example receives the packets sent in the previous example ZNetReceiverTest.java </p>

<p>Feature SupportThe majority of the XBee specification has been implemented for both 802.15.4 (Series 1) and ZNet 2.5/ZB Pro (Series 2).  See FeatureSupport for a full listing of supported API types. </p>

<p>AboutI received my first pair of XBee Pro radios in Nov &#39;07, after learning about them on the Arduino website.  I quickly learned that to take advantage of the real power in XBee radios (e.g. I/O Samples, ACK/Delivery Status, Remote AT etc.), you need to configure the radio in API mode.  I searched for open source XBee software with support for API mode, but couldn&#39;t find anything, so I decided to write my own.  I started coding on 12/15/2007 and after about 300 commits and several months later I released the software here, on Google Code. </p>

 summary : <p>DOMAssistantAJAXFormsAJAXForms is a plugin to DOMAssistant, and offers the possibility to submit forms dynamically through AJAX without posting the entire page. </p>

<p>Usage:Use DOMAssistant in your web page. Then include the DOMAssistantAJAXForms plugin. There are two ways of adding AJAX form functionality to a form: </p>

<p>Approach 1:Add the class &quot;ajax-form&quot; to any form you would like to be submitted via AJAX. For example: </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>Approach 2:Use a JavaScript call to apply the functionality to the form, and optionally, setting beforeSubmissionHandler, responseHandler and request headers. For example: </p>

<p>$(&quot;#form-id&quot;).setAJAXForm(function () {
<br/>	// Function to run before submission
<br/>}, function (response) {
<br/>	// Function to run to handle the response
<br/>}, {
<br/>	// Setting headers, as an object
<br/>	&quot;X-Requested-With&quot; : &quot;XMLHttpRequest&quot;
<br/>});When the posting is complete:You can, in three different ways, specify what function should be called once the posting is complete. </p>

<p>Alternative 1:    // Applies to the form with an id of &quot;form-id&quot; in the web page
<br/>    $(&quot;#form-id&quot;).setResponseHandler(functionToCall);Alternative 2:    // Applies to all AJAXForms in the web page
<br/>    DOMAssistant.AJAXForms.setResponseHandler(functionToCall);Alternative 3:        The called function:Using any of these approaches, in functionToCall, the first parameter will be the response from the request. The context will the form that it was called on, i.e. &quot;this&quot; in that function will be the form element which was posted. </p>

<p>Before the posting:If you want, for instance, to validate the form before it&#39;s sent, you can specify a function to run, and then continue posting if that function returns true, or stop the posting if it returns false. </p>

<p>You can, in three different ways, specify what function should be called before the posting occurs. </p>

<p>Alternative 1:    // Applies to the form with an id of &quot;form-id&quot; in the web page
<br/>    $(&quot;#form-id&quot;).setBeforeSubmissionHandler(functionToCall);Alternative 2:    // Applies to all AJAXForms in the web page
<br/>    DOMAssistant.AJAXForms.setBeforeSubmissionHandler(functionToCall);Alternative 3:        The called functionUsing any of these approaches, the context will the form that it was called on, i.e. &quot;this&quot; in that function will be the form element which was posted.</p>

 title : The comment-highlighter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I have stopped the development of this plugin until further notice. This plugin hasn&#39;t been tested with Wordpress 2.7 so I am not sure how it behaves with that release. </p>

<p>Comment Highlighter is a Wordpress plugin which can be used to add different style classes to comments. There are already plugins/hacks/alterations that adds a style to all comments written by the blog owner, adds a different style to every other comment, etc. This plugin takes it a bit further. </p>

<p>Depending on which rules you set up, then Comment Highlighter can add style to comments based on the email of the author (of the comment), the name or the URL. These styles can furhter more be locked to a specific post ID. </p>

<p>Some samples of what I use this plugin for: </p>

<p> Add a special CSS style to all comments written by myself 
<br/> Add a special CSS style to all comments written by my co-author (read: my wife  ) 
<br/> Add a special CSS style to all comments by a specific person on a specific post 
<br/> Add a special CSS style to all pingbacks 
<br/>There might be other Wordpress plugins that does the same as this one, but I wasn&#39;t able to find any. At least not a single plugin that did everything. </p>

<p> Please take general questions, comments, enhancement requests, etc. to the FAQ or list of issues and I will try to deal with them as soon as possible.</p>

 summary : <p>Rate this plugin at EclipsePluginCentral </p>

<p>Project GoalsThe goal of this project is to provide a view to cruise control projects within the eclipse workbench. </p>

<p>the Cruise Control Eclipse Plugin integrates monitoring of Cruise Control projects into the Eclipse Workbench.  The plugin provides two views:  </p>

<p>Cruise Control JMX View: It provides information about the build process using the RMI connector.  Cruise Control Rss Feed View: It provides information about the build process using the HTTP Adapter.  </p>

<p>PrerequisitesJDK 5 and higher  Eclipse 3.2 and higher  Cruise Control Installation with RMI connector Download and InstallationDownload either the Cruise Control Eclipse Plugin and copy it to the plugin directory of your eclipse installation or access the update site </p>

<p>Note: Using the Cruise Control JMX View requires to start Cruise Control using the -rmiPort switch.  </p>

<p>Description  The Cruise Control Eclipse Plugin provides two ways of access to cruise control information.  </p>

<p>Using the JMX API with the RMI connector (Cruise Control Jmx View) Using RSS Feeds with the http protocol (Cruise Control Feed View) </p>

<p>The first way is the more powerful since it provides advanced features like forcing a build, pausing or resuming a project. It also gets updates by using the JMX notification mechansim.  </p>

<p>Cruise Control Jmx ViewThis view connects to a cruise control host by using the RMI connector and gathers project information using the JMX API. After setting up projects in the preferences dialog, the view connects to these projects and displays each of the projects with its name as a root in a table tree view. The properties of a project are displayed as child items.  Double clicking a project or one of its properties opens the cruise control web page for the project.  The projects get notified whenever its states have changed.  A status of a project is also displayed as icon before the project name. This view is the recommended one.  </p>

<p>The Cruise Control JMX View only works properly if you start Cruise Control with -rmiPort switch </p>

<p>Note: If the cruise control was down, you have to press refresh to reconnect the plugin to the cruise control connector again. You will notice it when the state doesn&#39;t refresh itself.  </p>

<p>Cruise Control Feed ViewThis view gathers project information by using the RSS feeds provided by cruise control for a project. The feeds for each project are setup using the preferences dialog. For each project the state of the last build is displayed as an icon left from the project name string. As child items the feed entry items are displayed which are actually the recent history of build runs. Double clicking on the feed URL displays the crusie control web page for the project.  This view is useful if you cannot run the crusie control with the -rmiPort switch. </p>

 summary : <p>Notice:  This project is no longer supported.I recommend using Jeffrey Friedl’s new Lightroom 2.0 Geoencoding plugin.Available here: http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/gpsThis project installs menu items into the Adobe Lightroom interface that allows photos to be tagged with geographic information through the Lightroom interface.   </p>

<p>Locations are read from the standard GPX file format and exif information is stored in the image files using Phil Harvey&#39;s exiftool. </p>

<p>Make Comments and Suggestions Here </p>

<p>Current Version:Download: Version 0.1.0 </p>

<p>Features:Sync photo to GPS using picture of GPS display Interpolate location between track points Add geotags to original images or save to new location Installation:Copy the entire geotag.lrdevplugin directory to the following location: </p>

<p>(Vista)  C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Lightroom\Modules   (XP)  C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Adobe\Lightroom\Modules   (Mac)  /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Lightroom/Modules  </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionjqMultiSelects is a plugin for jQuery which enables the addition of common behaviour to </p>

<p> elements allowing multiple options to be selected. </p>

<p>FeaturesjqMultiSelects enables you to deal purely with the presentation of your </p>

<p> elements, and then use the plugin to attach common behaviours to them. Current features include: Set up double-click transferring of options from one select to another Enable transferring of multiple options via an external element, e.g. , , , etc. Automatic submission of  elements with parent form submission Callbacks to hook into the process Size is 4.4KB or 0.6KB packed </p>

<p>ExampleTo implement, start by creating your </p>

<p> elements: </p>

<p>   Item 1
<br/>   Item 2</p>

<p>move right
<br/>move left</p>

<p>   Item 3
<br/>   Item 4
<br/>Then, to add the Multi-Selects behaviour to these listboxes, simply perform the following (usually in the $(document).ready() event): </p>

<p>$(document).ready(function() {
<br/>   $(&quot;#select_left&quot;).multiSelect(&quot;#select_right&quot;, {trigger: &quot;#options_right&quot;});
<br/>   $(&quot;#select_right&quot;).multiSelect(&quot;#select_left&quot;, {trigger: &quot;#options_left&quot;});
<br/>})ChangelogVersion 0.2  </p>

<p> elements can be automatically selected upon parent form submission  plugin options now passed as an array  all element identifiers now taken as jQuery selectors instead  added beforeMove and afterMove callback functions Version 0.1  initial release </p>

<p>Future DevelopmentCurrently planned additions (roughly in priority order) include: </p>

<p>enable a graceful degradation - e.g. convert a group of checkboxes into 2 multiple selects Add ability to manually order items within a list Investigate  sorting plugins and check integration with transfers is easy </p>

 title : The jqueryselectcombo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A &#39;Select Combo&#39; is setting the values of a select element based on the user&#39;s choice of the source select element.  As a jQuery plugin, it will create &#39;unobtrusive&#39; javascript to bind a change event to the source select element and retrieve JSON results from your server, placing the results in the target select element.  This has been tested with jQuery 1.2.6. on FF 2 &amp; 3, IE7, Safari.  I hope this works with other browsers, but if it doesn&#39;t please let me know. (There is an error in IE 6.  I&#39;m currently unsure of what to do with the non helpful MS error of: &quot;Could not set the selected property.  Unspecified error&quot;) </p>

<p>This plugin requires jQuery - a most awesome javascript library for AJAX, AHAH, and all that! </p>

<p>See the Demo of the selectCombo plugin </p>

<p>Rob D from down under has posted a demo using a large set of data </p>

<p>9/9/2008 - Bypassed select first object for IE - no more IE 6 error </p>

<p>8/29/2008 - 1.2.5 Release - Fixed bug that only called change for children if the hidetarget had been set. </p>

<p>6/24/2008 - 1.2.4 Release - Fixed functionality when selectCombo is used for multiple select objects.  Will now execute the change event for each of the successive targets on change of the parent. </p>

<p>3/1/2007 - 1.2.3 Release - Changed when the hidetarget was called so that targets aren&#39;t hidden onchange unless there are no values returned for targets </p>

<p>12/15/2007 - 1.2.2 Release - Fixed issue with target not hiding when there are no options in target </p>

<p>8/30/2007 - 1.2.1 Release - removed console.log line that may cause problems in IE </p>

<p>8/22/2007 - 1.2 Release added option to set target options when the page loads (you may have a default value selected in the primary select that you want to &quot;preload&quot; options in your target) </p>

<p>Clearing options of target before calling getJSON (if primary not same as target) so that if no results are returned target reflects no results of selected primary (if you want there to be something loaded as a place holder for the target, have your server return something like: [{oV: &#39;&#39;, oT: &#39;-No Option-&#39;}] </p>

<p>Changed check on hidetarget.  Instead of checking that the primary select has no selected value, will now check that the target has no value.  If hidetarget == true, target will hide onload when no value in target and will hide if no options available on change </p>

<p>5/25/2007 - 1.1 Release added option for indicator display during ajax call, added check that if target ID is the same as the original source, it will override hidetarget setting and not hide target</p>
 title : The jsdoctk-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introductionjsdoctk-plugin aims simply to create a Mojo around JsDoc Toolkit so that you can run it from within maven. Inside the plugins&#39; jar is a packaged version of JsDoc Toolkit which gets temporarily unpacked into your target directory and is then used to run JsDoc Toolkit on your webapp directory. As a result you can now, easily and without a hassle, create documentation for your javascripts within a maven project... </p>

<p>ProgressA new version based on the JsDoc Toolkit 2.0.1 is finally released. It&#39;s been on ice for quite a while since I had problems during testing months ago and was on the road and busy with work in the weeks since then. Now that I&#39;m back home and needed the plugin to work, I polished it, packaged it and released it for you guys and girls out there to enjoy. </p>

<p>For those not familiar with the changes in 2.x of JsDoc Toolkit I would give you an advance warning, the templates have changed significantly and this may, or may not be to your liking. I have no control over this!!! For this reasons alone I will keep the 1.x versions available for download, but support may grow even weaker than it has been so far ;). </p>

<p>DownloadsFor people new with this plugin I recommend downloading the .zip distribution as I have added a usefull README as well as the &#39;JavaDoc&#39; for the jar with more detailed information. If you&#39;re sure of what you&#39;re doing and just looking for the latest version go ahead and download the .jar, it saves only a little in size though :). </p>

<p>Alternatively, even though this keeps me from being able to track the popularity of this project, you can now specify a repository in your pom.xml like so: </p>

<br/>    ConfigurationInstallation Instructions as well as detailed Configuration Instructions are also available online in case you can&#39;t be bothered downloading the .zip and reading the README contained within, one small warning, I am more likely to keep the README updated rather than the online version, though this mostly means you&#39;ll have to be carefull to use the correct version-numbers in the commands outlined in the instructions...</p>

 title : The livepress Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Live+Press </p>

<p>Description: </p>

<p>Livepress is a plugin for wordpress which allows the user to automatically crosspost journal entries to a LiveJournal account.   </p>

<p>This fork of the plugin is licensed under GPLv3.  All contributions and suggestions are welcome. </p>

<p>Please report bugs under &quot;Issues&quot; section.  </p>

<p>Current version features list:  </p>

<p>(Tested with Wordpress 2.5.1 and 2.6) cross posting full posts or exerpts with lj_cuts tags cross posting of User Pics, Moods, Music, and Tags choose LJ security level and custom friends lists enable / disable comments on livejournal side include a link back to the original wordpress post (new) cross posts Tags instead of Categories (new) post delete also deletes livejournal post (new) automatic crosspost email and cell phone text and multimedia posts  </p>

<p>Upcoming Version 2.1 features list: (available 9/2008) </p>

<p>plugin reset button bulk deletes (new with wp 2.6) also bulk deletes LJ posts Livepress Extras style changed to match wordpress 2.6 admin theme.  Livepress Admin page style change to match wordpress 2.6 admin theme. (bug fix: Id 1) Overhaul to how Livepress saves login information.  </p>

<p>  Future features wish list: </p>

<p>scheduled post for future publishing will crosspost at the future scheduled time, instead of immediately. ability to choose between syncing tags or categories. ability to disable comments by default, instead of post by post basis. ability to post a link to an entry on Facebook. expand Livepress to sync with other popular sites that use the LiveJournal engine such as InsaneJournal, DeadJournal. expand to sync with MySpace. </p>

<p>Livepress History Lesson: </p>

<p>Livepress was originally written by Jason Goldsmith (Aka: &quot;unteins&quot;) back in 2005.  He maintained the plugin up until 2006.  His last updated version of the plugin, I believe, was 1.99.   </p>

<p>When the plugin ceased to work with newer releases of Wordpress in 2006, it was kept working by &quot;CreepiGurl&quot;.  The last known version of the plugin was 1.99.9, made available in 2006.  Later, information on how to hack the plugin to get it working with WP version 2.2, sometime in 2007, could be found on her site. </p>

<p>Fast forward to 2008: As a fan of the original plugin, I have kept a personal copy updated with changes I wanted and needed.  So with this new project, I hope to keep the plugin alive.   (Because I really don&#39;t like the alternatives!) </p>

 title : The mercurialidea Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mercurial Plugin for IdeaStatusThe plugin provides a subset of the functionality that you need for working with Mercurial in Idea. </p>

<p>What WorksCurrently the plugin has the following functionality: </p>

<p>Add Delete Commit Revert History Tag Pull Merge- with an external tool Push Move Rename Functionality to come: </p>

<p>Copy Clone Integrated merging Implementation InformationThe plugin is implemented by creating an external process executing the hg executable, and then screen scraping the result. </p>

<p>You can use the hg command line tool in conjunction with Idea. If things look like they are out of sync, then the Refresh File Status function on the Version Control menu will refresh the file status of all files. </p>

<p>Currently merge will call out to an external merge program. I use kdiff3 at this stage. Integrated merging for the plugin is coming... </p>

<p>To InstallFirstly, you must have Mercurial installed. The plugin is tested with Mercurial version 0.9.5 on Windows Vista, built with JDK 1.5.0. You can install the plugin from the Plugin Manager in Idea. </p>

<p>The plugin is developed on IntelliJ IDEA 7.0.3 #7718(It should work as far back as 7065). It will not work on IntelliJ IDEA 6. </p>

<p>Source CodeIn the interested of eating our own dog food, the source code has been moved to a Mercurial repository at FreeHg. To provide a patch, clone this repository, post your issue in the issues database here and include the URL to your repository. Let me know when your changes are ready and I will pull your changes from there and review them. If you do not have a repository that you can expose on the internet, then you can use FreeHg to create one.</p>

<p>Mippin makes it easy to find your favorites, discover what others are reading and share whatever interests you, wherever you are. </p>

<p>This site has been designed so you, as a developer or blog publisher can get a more from Mippin, through APIs or additional tools which can allow further integration directly into your existing blog. </p>

<p>Making Content look good on Cell PhonesContent which can be easily rendered on any cell phone has been traditionally very difficult. Users have got very frustrated waiting for web pages to load on their phones and then for them to display in a very unfriendly way. Even the iPhone can take more than 60 seconds to load a normal sized web page. Some carriers have introduced transcoder to help render the content in a more suitable format for phones. However, this approach is flawed because the variety of formats on the web make this task often impossible to do well. Mippin took the approach of using RSS feeds from sites as the raw content for rendering on the phone. Mippin then goes much further to ensure the rendering of the content is perfect for every single device. For example photos are scaled to perfectly fill the horizontal dimension of the screen, videos are converted on the fly to the 3gp format commonly used on phones and games are delivered according the phones capabilities. </p>

<p>Mippin has as a product has been active since Oct 2007 and growth in user take-up and available content has been strong. </p>

<p>Mippin is a free service to the consumer and its revenue model is via advertising in its own content. Adverts are not shown in the publishers content without their permission and if they are the publishers can get up to 100% of the advertising revenue. </p>

 summary : <p>Use your Twitter account as your Pidgin status message.New to 0.4.0Support for updating multiple savedstatuses (For away on idle etc.) Status format changes would be picked up even if there are no updates. Twitter status now writes to a saved status, rather than the main one. Add more debugging information to help debugging any issues Fix print undefined purple status message Fix when no XML data is returned. Use in_reply_to_user_id XML node instead of string parsing, to detect replies. &#39;Advanced option&#39; to set a regular expression, which is tested against the tweet, and discarded if matching (I, for example, set it to #twitter, so that twitter specific tweets are ignored) If the first status is not suitable, go for the second, and so on... If the user changes status after we set it, don&#39;t trash the changes, unless we have a more recent update from Twitter. Only downloads diffs from Twitter from previous update using since_id: Saves bandwidth, and friendlier to Twitter servers. Stricter username checking, just reschedule timer and return instead of die&#39;ing for invalid usernames, so that we can pickup any username changes from preferences. Use an integer for timeout preference, and remove all the string parsing &#39;Advanced option&#39; to set the API root url, instead of http://twitter.com. http://identi.ca/api should work as well, though I haven&#39;t tested that much. (identi.ca support for free, thus!) Minor code cleanups: Use variables where sane instead of hardcoding, version http user agent, use strict and warnings on Perl, fix scopes of various variables. Existing FeaturesUpdate your status as frequently or infrequently as you wish. @ messages can be ignored.</p>

 summary : <p>Adds completion of saved PuTTY sessions to Launchy. </p>

<p>08/05/08 - PuTTY Plugin v2.2 released! </p>

<p>UPDATES
<br/>The latest version of this software can always be found at:
<br/>http://putty-launchy-plugin.googlecode.com/</p>

<p>USAGE
<br/>Version 2.0+ of PuTTY Plugin for Launchy will work only with v2.0+ of Launchy.</p>

<p>If PuTTY.exe is not in your system PATH, you will need to set the path to PuTTY 
<br/>in the options dialog.  To access the options, right click on the Launchy window 
<br/>and click &quot;Options&quot;.  Next go to the &quot;Plugins&quot; tab and select &quot;PuTTY&quot;.  You can 
<br/>customize and enable/disable many features of this plugin here.</p>

<p>To begin completion, type &quot;ssh&quot; or &quot;putty&quot; followed by tab or space. The plugin 
<br/>will list all of your PuTTY sessions.  After you select a session in Launchy, it 
<br/>will be launched in PuTTY.</p>

<p>If you want to use this plugin in portable mode you will first need PuTTY Tray 
<br/>or portaPuTTY in order to save sessions to a filesystem.  Next set the &quot;Path to 
<br/>PuTTY&quot; in the plugin options dialog to the RELATIVE path from the Launchy 
<br/>directory to the PuTTY executable.  Finally, enable loading sessions from the 
<br/>filesystem in the plugin options dialog.</p>

<br/>    Added loading sessions from filesystem
<br/>    Added error message when putty.exe can&#39;t be found</p>

<p>v2.0
<br/>    Now supports Launchy v2.0 (complete rewrite)
<br/>    Added configurable options for just about everything
<br/>    Trigger words can be changed (defaults to &quot;ssh&quot; and &quot;putty&quot;)
<br/>    Sessions can be added directly to index, with no trigger word required</p>

<p>v1.3
<br/>    Parameters not matching a session name will now be treated as a host name
<br/>    Session names containing quote marks now work</p>

<p>v1.2:

 summary : <p>SKOSEd is a plugin for Protege 4 that allows you to create and edit thesauri (or similar artefacts) represented in the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS).  </p>

<p>SKOS is now a W3C recommendation and users familiar with SKOS will notice that SKOSEd still treats labels as OWL data properties. Luckily, you can create labels as annotations using the standard Protege 4 interface. The developers of Protege 4 are trying to keep Protege 4 and the underlying OWL API inline with the latest OWL 2 specification, which has recently undergone some changes. Work on SKOSEd has been temporarily halted while Protege 4.1 and the underlying OWL API are updated. One of the main advantages these changes will bring is that SKOSEd will allow the creation of sub-annotation properties. The porting of the SKOSEd plugin to Protege 4.1 will take place in September/October 2009. Please e-mail directly if you any queries about this. Simon </p>

 summary : <p>Spreadshop Wordpress PluginThis plugin it&#39;s tested on WordPress 2.3.1Nowadays I&#39;m writing the goPHP5 version 2.0 that will use a slim SOAP client instead of the huge XML parser. </p>

<p>Ok guys I&#39;m sorry. This project is abandoned. If someone wants to join, is welcome. </p>

<p>Spreadshirt is a online gadget service, with it you can easily sell online your personal t-shirts and gadgets with a cool and fast Macromedia Flash creator interface. Items quality seem excelent but prices aren&#39;t so cheap. </p>

<p>This plugin is already quite stable. I have to praise all active users who posted bugs in the forum and helped with developement. </p>

<p>InstallationFirst of all you should register an account at Spreadshirt.net if you&#39;re European, or Spreadshirt.com if you&#39;re American. So you&#39;ll avoid transatlantic shipping Customize your shop settings, and add some cool products to your shop (don&#39;t forget to write down your SHOP ID) Download Spreadshirt plugin for WordPress Extract the spreadshop directory into your FTP wp-content/plugins directory Go to administration panel and visit the plugin page, then activate the Spreadshop plugin Go to Manage » Spreadshop and fill the options as you want. You&#39;ll need the SHOP ID you wrote down before. Once you&#39;ll submit the option page, the plugin will fetch your items data from Spreadshirt website. So remember to submit that form every time you&#39;ll add new products UsageTo get entire the shop embed into your blog, you must push it in a normal page.  Create that page, and give it a pretty title, then fill the content with this string only: </p>

<p>Now save the page and your Spreadshop will just appear online like a sharme. </p>

<p>If you want to embed a single product into a post, or a page, you should use the following code syntax into your posts: </p>

<p>The number must be an existent article id, you can find that number in the URL of details page. </p>

<p>The column separator is optional and size string too, it&#39;s used to force a specific image size: </p>

<p>If you want to show a random product from your shop, you must edit the theme. Probably you&#39;ll want it into the sidebar, so edit sidebar.php and put in this code: </p>

<p>You can manage the size of the random thumbnail. Simply add into parenthesis one of this words between two single or double quotes: small, medium, big, huge.  </p>

<p>Size reference stands in the administration page. You can find it in a drop down list, with pixel dimensions. </p>

<p>UpgradingGo to administration and visit plugins page, then disable Spreadshop plugin Delete from FTP wp-content/plugins/spreadshop directory Follow installation instructions, your options are not lost. You&#39;ll get them back once you re-activate the new version into plugin page.

 summary : <p>In Rails, caching is one of those things that is made pretty easy, but can also be difficult when you want to do complex tasks with the caching -- such as expiring it. There are two ways with expire_fragment within the logic of your controllers or using an Observers. </p>

<p>This plugin allows caching to be expired on predefined time limit. The idea is that the caching takes cared of the expiration instead of writing conditions in the controller. I understand that it goes against the idea of why the caching mechanism does not have them now. </p>

<p>To the plugin. Its an extension of cache method that has logic for the time limit. The method to use within views is called cache_timeout. The first argument of the method is the regular Hash/String of the cache key and the second argument is the timeout value (being a Time class value). </p>

<p>Example usage: </p>

<p># This is last 5 minutes of posts from our forums:   </p>

<p>&lt;%cache_timeout(&#39;forum_listing&#39;,5.minutes.from_now) do %&gt;   
<br/>   
<br/>&lt;% for post in @posts %&gt;   
<br/>&lt;%=post.title%&gt; - by &lt;%=post.author.username%&gt; at &lt;%=post.created_at&gt;Unknown end tag for </p>

<p>   
<br/>&lt;%end%&gt;   
<br/>   
<br/>&lt;%end%&gt; </p>

<p>To enforce the timeout cache value within the controller don&#39;t use the read_fragment method -- unless really needed. The method that is provided to check that the timeout value has is expired is is_cache_expired?. The method takes the argument of the cache key. </p>

<p>Example Usage within controller: </p>

<p>def list </p>

<p>if is_cache_expired?(&#39;forum_listing&#39;) 
<br/>@posts = Post.find(:all) 
<br/>end

 title : The tinymce-plugin-advimagescale Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When developing a custom CMS with TinyMCE for a company project, I found that scaling/resizing an image in the TinyMCE editor allows stretching/skewing an image in a way that distorts image aspect ratio.  Finding this to be an odd &#39;default&#39; behavior, I developed this plugin.  </p>

<p>The default behavior of tinymce-plugin-advimagescale solves the problem by: </p>

<p>Maintaining aspect ratio on image scaling by watching for image resize events and preserving the &quot;most changed&quot; dimension and adjusting the other to maintain aspect ratio Working around browser bugs in the UI that make resizing problematic. </p>

<p>Optional features include: </p>

<p>Enforce a minimum/maximum image dimensions Append width and height dimensions to the  src path to allow a dynamic server-side script to perform automatic resampling on the image (i.e. via imagemagick or GD2) (for example, a URL such as http://www.mydomain.com/picture.php?id=123 would be changed to http://www.mydomain.com/picture.php?id=123&amp;w=200&amp;h=400 to indicate an image scaled to 200x400) Callbacks for image events including loading, loaded and resize events - this allows you to build your own custom handling for image events in the editor and access image properties. </p>

<p>Soruce is available for check-out via SVN.  There are no zipped downloads for this plugin - simply check-out the source via SVN or download via the code browser. See the Usage page for full instructions. </p>

<p>Tested only IE7, IE8 and Firefox 3 on Windows Vista &amp; Windows 7.  Google Chrome/Webkit (and therefore Safari as well) do not presently support image scaling in designMode, so this plugin does not apply).  Patches are welcome. </p>

<p>If you find a bug, please submit it using the issue tracker tab (above). </p>

 title : The wpng-calendar Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThe Wordpress Google calendar plugin allows for the integration of a Google calendar into a Wordpress blog.  </p>

<p>We are currently at release 0.8.5. You can download it at the right ===&gt;. </p>

<p>For release notes, please see the change log. </p>

<p>InstallationThis section describes how to install the plugin and get it working. </p>

<p>Request Google GDATA API key (see link below) Upload the contents of the ZIP file to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu Configure your GDATA API key in the plugin options panel Configure a Google calendar in the plugin options panel Configure the option to render the description field as Wiki markup Create a page and add the &#39;show-wpng-calendar&#39; custom field with the number of weeks you want to be displayed Add the widget to your sidebar and configure the title and number of events to display The plugin-in requires a valid Google GDATA API key. Only one calendar can be associated with the plug-in (want more?, request an enhancement). </p>

<p>NOTE: The API key must correspond to your domain URL. Read this snippet from the Google API site for more information: </p>

<p>A key is associated with a website. If you want to use the JavaScript client library on another site, you should obtain another key for that site. More specifically, a key is associated with the URL that you enter on the signup page; the key applies to all URLs under the domain or directory that you specify. </p>

<p>NOTE: It is also important to note that you must use the full version of the Google calendar. By default, the address to the calendar will point to the basic format. Change basic to full in the URL in order to have the plugin work correctly. </p>

<p>Displaying The CalendarCalendar data can be displayed in three ways: </p>

<p>As a widget in the sidebarThe simplest way to incorporate the calendar is to use the WPNG Calendar widget. The widget is installed as a part of the plugin-in, so you already have it. Use this widget like any other widget, drag-n-drop it into the sidebar where you want the calendar to appear.  </p>

<p>Once the widget is there, you can customize the Title shown in the sidebar and the number of events that are displayed. Access these values in the widget&#39;s options panel. </p>

<p>As a pageCalendar data can also be embedded within a Page. The page will initially list data starting with the current date. The amount of data shown in the page will depend on the value you enter in the custom fields&#39; value box. At the bottom of the page, links  will be displayed to allow the user to navigate to the next interval of data. To embed a calendar into a page, follow these steps: </p>

<p>Create a page, give it any title you desire Add the following as a custom field: show-wpng-calendar In the value field enter the number of weeks of data you wish to display at one time Uncheck &quot;Allow Comments&quot; in the Discussion settings for the page Displaying an eventWhether clicked from the side bar or from a page, each event can be displayed within its own modal DIV. The event view will show all details that are available from the Google calendar for that particular calendar entry. As an option, you can choose to render the description field of an event using wiki markup. The markup syntax is similar to most common wiki markup languages. For more information, see the Wiki formatting page. </p>

<p>FormattingWe made every attempt to make the calendar integrate with themes as much as possible. If you do have a need to edit the style of event lists or the ThickBox dialog, you can use the following: </p>

<p>wpng-calendar/css/style.css wpng-calendar/css/thickbox.css You can update the size of the modal, but alter this line in the functions.js: </p>

<p>/* add the div to my modified ThickBox function */
<br/>tb_show_inner(&quot;&quot;,entryDiv.innerHTML,&quot;height=500&amp;width=500&quot;);ScreenshotsCalendar In A Page &amp; As A Widget </p>

 summary : <p>A configuration to assist editing xml2rfc-format documents using XMLMind XML Editor. </p>

<p>See Installation for how to install.  Super-brief installation instructions: drag the .xxe_addon file from the right column of this page to your addon preferences and use the xxe addon manager. </p>

<p>Make sure you download and install XMLMind XML Editor first.  This configuration works with both Personal and Professional editions.  Some features (e.g., format using XSLT) only work with Professional edition. </p>

<p>This is a WYSIKN (What You See Is Kinda Neat) addon for the very configurable XMLMind XML Editor (“xxe”). The personal version of xxe is free and very capable. It&#39;s also written in java, so one addon works on many platforms (I&#39;ve tested it on MacOS, Windows 2000 and FreeBSD). </p>

<p>The addon is capable of graphical editing of sections, anchors, lists, cross-references, etc. and allows word processor-like behavior of &quot;enter&quot; to create a new paragraph or list item. It can use a locally-installed xml2rfc to format the document for preview or conversion, or use xxe&#39;s built-in XSL transform or submit the document to the xml.resource.org web form. It provides easy hooks to validate the references to other IETF documents in your document to make sure they&#39;re up to date.</p>

TODO and Brainstorminglow priority enhancement:  button. for now more stays intact. low priority task: Get your hands on features not yet implemented such as proxy settings, additional HTTP headers normal priority: Intensive testing with random theme stylesheets. low priority: Theming the editor could be a big plus. for example two or three different themes (basically icons, placeholders) normal priority: Make a tutorial on how to use the JS hooks. For example by providing something useful like a microformats plugin-addon, or a more-button. Collect ideas and Feedback from pioneer users. high priority: Make sure the numerous typography plugins like typogrify will still work with XStandard normal priority: manage User and Role specific settings. (I had good experiences with the role manager plugins in the past. However, the downside is that only people with this tool installed are able to fully make use of applying new xstandard privileges to single users, user groups and roles. If I would code a solution for this on my own it would be an hilarious amount of work... high priority: There are many risky scenarios where the inserted content is not what it should be. (verify the encoding. twice. important task.) disabling wpautop makes sense in many ways (performance, making sure valid xhtml doesn&#39;t get messed up with all those regex guessing), but what happens with published posts? We need a test here. A flag/meta field or something that tells WordPress if a post has been published with XStandard (thus it IS XHTML and doesn&#39;t need that filters that tinkerMCE obviously needs so much) normal priority:Beautify the folder structure. Think this through some more. File based customization (eg. the user xmls or an interface to customize?)  low priority: Add Inline Editing feature. (so logged-in users can quickly edit articles on the website) high priority: Bad problem with the folded menu in the admin cp. XStandard behaves like max z-index. Resolvedhigh priority: find out how to save valid xhtml posts in a way, that doesn&#39;t make wordpress strip all markup when the plugin is deactivated (and regular post filters apply).(comment: regular post filters should have no problem with valid markup) Run far far away if people report bugs. (comment: no one does. :) pheew. )</p>

<p>It can greatly simplify merging, parsing and manipulating several iCalendar files all at once. </p>

<p>Simple structure - Intuitive mapping between iCalendar components, names, parameters and properties and Perl data structure.  Complete Support - Near complete RFC 2445 support by concentrating mostly on the iCalendar file format.  Pure Perl - Available on all platforms where a Perl port exists.  Win32::GUI::XMLBuilderWin32::GUI::XMLBuilder or WGX is a way to build simple Win32 GUI interfaces in Perl while keeping the visual design separate from the inner workings of the code. </p>

<p>WGX makes it easy to add a Win32 user interface to whatever script or module you’re writing. </p>

<p>XML Based GUI Creation - Keeping your GUI structure in XML format is easier to grasp than needing to maintain a linear list of commands to construct each element. Dynamic Auto-resizing - Writing simple Win32::GUI applications can be annoying having to manually write widget and child resizing routines, WGX deals with this automatically but keeping track of your widgets and fitting them to their parents. One can still override the defaults if required. Embeded Perl Events - Win32::GUI NEM events allow you to specify a widget and attach a callback or event routine at the same time. Extended Widget Set - WGX provides some additional widgets that augment Win32::GUI such as WGXSplitter, WGXPanel and WGXMenu. Read an Introduction that was published in The Perl Journal.</p>

 summary : <p>GoalsThe goals of the Cloud Perl project are </p>

<p>to bring together the community of people who use Perl for Cloud Computing to think of and implement better ways to use Perl for Cloud Computing to provide support for people who want to use Perl for Cloud Computing </p>

<p>Get InvolvedAnyone who is interested in following the discussion should sign up on the mailing lists. Please sign up on the Cloud Perl mailing list, regarding anything having to do with Cloud Computing in Perl. Please also sign up for any of the mailing lists devoted to specific Cloud Computing technologies. the Perl-AppEngine mailing list supports the Perl-AppEngine project to get Perl supported as a language on Google App Engine. Start discussing your ideas of how to move this project forward. Ideas can be floated on the mailing list. However, to make meaningful progress on an idea, it should be documented on the wiki. Discussion on the mailing list will be centered around updating those documented ideas. When ideas mature, they should definitely be documented on the wiki on this project site. Project Status2008-06-20 - This project is just starting up. Help us get the word out. Overview&quot;Cloud Computing&quot; has arisen as a powerful new computing paradigm (1). Many people are doing things in Perl that relate to this, and this project offers a place for people to discuss the topic and share knowledge. </p>

<p>If you are actively working in Cloud Computing with Perl (on any reasonable cloud computing platform, such as EC2, CloudDB, Hypertable, etc.) or are interested in it, please sign up for the cloud-perl mailing list. </p>

 summary : <p>Please see the main Continuity website at http://continuity.tlt42.org/</p>

<p>At its core the web uses the stateless HTTP protocol. In a CGI setting, this effectively means that your program is re-started during each instance of user input, losing all current variable values and other program state information. Most applications combat this by keeping track of the current application state in GET, POST, and session variables, effectively implementing an ad-hoc State Machine.</p>

<p>Continuity uses a programming concept called continuations to make HTTP seem like a statefull protocol instead of stateless protocol. This technique is increasingly called creating a Continuation Server. Continuity is a suite of libraries (not a framework) for building a highly structured web-based interface for your application, without using ad-hoc state management. Continuity is Free Software, distributed under the same terms as Perl itself.</p>

 title : The perl-mobile-wurfl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mobile::Wurfl is a perl module that provides an interface to mobile device information represented in wurfl (http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/). The Mobile::Wurfl module works by saving this device information in a database (preferably mysql).</p>

<p>It offers an interface to create the relevant database tables from a SQL file containing &quot;CREATE TABLE&quot; statements (a sample is provided with the distribution). It also provides a method for updating the data in the database from the wurfl.xml file hosted at http://www.nusho.it/wurfl/dl.php?t=d&amp;f=wurfl.xml.</p>

<p>It provides methods to query the database for lists of capabilities, and groups of capabilities. It also provides a method for generating a &quot;canonical&quot; user agent string (see &quot;canonical_ua&quot;).</p>

<p>Finally, it provides a method for looking up values for particular capability / user agent combinations. By default, this makes use of the hierarchical &quot;fallback&quot; structure of wurfl to lookup capabilities fallback devices if these capabilities are not defined for the requested device.</p>
 summary : <p>Most MySQL drivers (and database drivers in general) are synchronous, i.e. the execution of a script is blocked until having connected to the database or having obtained the result of a query. This is often unacceptable for highload services, since one probably wants the script do something useful while MySQL server is executing a long query. So perl-mysql-async is developed to make asynchronous requests to the server: a script submits a query, specifies a callback for the result and continues executing in the libevent loop; when the result of the query is completely read from the server, the specified callback is called with the result as a parameter.  </p>

<p>New versions of MySQL 4.1 protocol and newer versions are supported.</p>

 title : The perl-net-epp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionEPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 4930) is an application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared central repository. Specified in XML, the protocol defines generic object management operations and an extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects. As of writing, its only well-developed application is the provisioning of Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details. </p>

<p>This project offers a number of Perl modules which implement various EPP-related functions: </p>

<p>a low level protocol implementation (Net::EPP::Protocol) a low-level client (Net::EPP::Client) a high-level client (Net::EPP::Simple) an EPP frame builder (Net::EPP::Frame) an EPP proxy server (Net::EPP::Proxy) a utility library to export EPP responde codes (Net::EPP::ResponseCodes) These modules were originally created and maintained by CentralNic for use by their own registrars, but since their original release have become widely used by registrars and registries of all kinds. </p>

<p>CentralNic has chosen to create this project to allow interested third parties to contribute to the development of these libraries, and to guarantee their long-term stability and maintenance. </p>

<p>PreppiPreppi is a graphical EPP client written in Perl. It uses the modules listed above as well as the GTK and GNOME bindings for Perl. For more information about Preppi, click here. </p>

<p>DownloadsThe Net::EPP modules are distributed via CPAN in a single package to allow for easy installation. To install the package, simply use the cpan command: </p>

<p># cpan -i Net::EPPDocumentationThe CPAN search site automatically generates documentation for these modules from the inline POD documentation - click on the module names above to view the documentation for each module. </p>

 summary : <p>The Perl Sitemap Generator is a Perl script that creates a Sitemap for your site using the Sitemap Protocol. This script can create Sitemaps from URL lists, web server directories, access logs, or from other sitemaps. </p>

<p>This tool is a translation of Google Sitemap Generator from python to perl. </p>

<p>In order to use this script: </p>

<p>You must be able to connect to and run scripts on your web server. Your web server must have Perl 5.8.0 or later installed. You must know the directory path to your site. If your web server hosts one site, this may be a path such as var/www/html. If you have a virtual server that hosts multiple sites, this may be a path such as home/virtual/site1/fst/var/www/html. You must be able to upload files to your web server (for instance, using FTP). If you will be generating a list of URLs based on access logs, you must know the encoding used for those logs and the complete path to them. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t sure about any of this, you can check with your web hosting company. </p>

<p>Now you’re ready to get started. Here’s an overview of what you’ll need to do. </p>

<p> Download the Sitemap Generator program files. Extract the files to a local directory.  Create a configuration file for your site using the provided example_config.xml file as a template. Modify this file as needed for your site and save it.  Upload the necessary files to your web server.  Run sitemap_gen.pl.  Add the generated Sitemap to your Google webmaster tools account.  Set up a recurring script. (optional) If you are unable to use the Sitemap Generator, you can add a Sitemap to your Google webmaster tools account in another format, such as a simple text file. You can also find links to third-party programs that support Google Sitemaps here.</p>

 title : The calvis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Calendar Visualization (CalVis) is designed to provide an easy and customizable user interface (UI) to present data from Google Calendar account. CalVis draws data directly from your Google Calendar account via the Google Calendar Data API. It makes use of the Google Data JavaScript client library underneath to communciate with Google Calendar, and is designed to maximize flexibility in customization.  </p>

<p>CalVis is designed to spare developers from having to re-create the rich calendar UI experience. The developers can use it as customizable template container to overlay Google Calendar data. Developers can use CalVis to render calendar data and to achieve a deep level of customized integration with their sites. As you will learn, an interface that is built on top of CalVis is completely customizable through JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Developers would be able to quickly and easily deploy a customized calendar interface with a set of essential calendar control components to render calendar data.  </p>

 title : The arpc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is “arpc”?“arpc” is an acronym for AJAX Remote Procedure Calls AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript and XML XML: Extensible Markup Language It is a tool that creates Javascript client stubs and PHP server stubs from an “.arpc” file for RPC’s (Remote Procedure Calls). The “.arpc” file contains all the data types (data structures) and remote procedure prototypes that you want for your web-app. Once you have created the “.arpc” file, you “compile” it with “arpcgen” (program/script) to create the required stubs (client/Javascript, server/PHP). The XML-RPC standard is used for communications between the client and server. This is why I called the tool “arpc”, the “X” from “AJAX” represents the “XML” in “XML-RPC”. Note: RPC calls from the client (Javascript) are asynchronous (the code that calls the stub is not blocked after the request is sent), this is a feature AJAX provides, this is an advantageous for longer requests. Why “arpc”?I wanted to use AJAX to access remote procedures on a server but I could not find any tools on the web that did what I wanted. So I decided to create my own tool, sure I could have hand-coded the client/server stubs, but this would not be reusable in future web-apps that I might create in the future.  Basically, I want to use AJAX in my “12.0 Student” web-app.  Most of the existing tools on the weren’t designed to exchange “data structures”, they basically just returned the string from the server and assigned in to a document element, so the server controlled the dynamic HTML on the page directly. With “arpc” the server and client code are completely isolated. So the person who is developing the client-side of the web-app, just needs to know what remote procedures the server provides and what they do. Similarly, the person who is developing the server-side of the web-app just need to know what functions they need to provide and what the functions should do.  Since the XML-RPC protocol is used for communications, the server and client stubs do not need to be used together. You can use the client  stub with an existing XML-RPC web service, as long as you know the procedure name and required parameters. Similarly, the server stub can be used to service existing XML-RPC clients. Why XML-RPC as the communications protocol? SOAP is the protocol used by most web-services nowadays, but the standard is much larger than XML-RPC (which is about six pages). It can do almost everything you need for simple RPC’s.  Existing standard, I don’t have to “re-invent the wheel”.  Simple protocol to implement, and I am the only person working on the tool at the moment! How does it work?Step 1: Design required remote procedures and create stubs. Step 2: Create remaining server/client application. Step 3: Use web-app.</p>

 title : The bitxml-dot-org Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>While efforts have been made in order to identify a &#39;killer protocol&#39; in the M2M arena, it seems that no one has hit the target yet.</p>

<p>For this reason, we felt that the best way to approach the problem was to define an extendible protocol - targeting at first the core functionalities commonly required by M2M applications - and lying on a very general architectural model: this is in fact the BiTXml protocol design approach.</p>

<p>Our main guidelines have been readability and easy extendibility of the protocol specifications, including the support for different I/O ports, network protocols, and core functionalities.</p>

<p>The result - in line with an evolutionary project - wants to be of help to anyone is facing a generic M2M project and needs a reference framework to express commands and control processes in an easy yet powerful manner.</p>

 title : The checkdigits Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Check digits (or characters) are a &#39;checksum&#39; on a number or word to help prevent manual typing errors. </p>

<p>This was originally based from Cryptography for Internet and Database Applications, pp 221-229. </p>

<p>This projects provides examples and source in both java and javacript. </p>

<p>Check digits (or characters) are a &#39;checksum&#39; on a number or word to help prevent manual typing errors.   They are not used for long or binary data sets.  They are not hashes, nor cryptographic.  They do not do error correction.  They are for catching CheckDigitsAndManualErrors. </p>

<p>The following schemes are currently implemented: </p>

<p>Dihedral Luhn, Mod 10 ISO 7064, Mod 11,2 ISO 7064, Mod 11,10 ISO 7064, Mod 97,10 More information on each is in CheckDigitSystems. </p>

<p>All versions have some type of &#39;object&#39; with the following methods: </p>

<p>encode	   Adds check digit to given string   verify	   Verifies data is correct using check digits   computeCheck  Returns the check digit (as integer) for given data   getCheck	   Extracts the check characters   getData	   Extracts the data with out the check character  </p>

<p>encode may throw an exception if &#39;bad&#39; data (e.g. non-numeric) is passed to it, while verify only returns true or false. The idea here is that encode normally gets it&#39;s data from &#39;trusted&#39; internal sources (a database key for instance), so it should be pretty usual, in fact, exceptional that bad data is being passed in. verify doesn&#39;t throw exceptions since this data is coming from an &#39;untrusted&#39; source such user input and who knows what they&#39;ll type in. Bad input is &#39;non-exceptional&#39; and is expected. </p>

<p>Note: unless explicitly specified, the code does not check the input length or trim off white space since that is application specific. </p>

<p>The verify method could have been universally implemented as encode(getData(str)) == getCheck(str), however in most caes custom code was implemented. This was done so that: </p>

<p>Reduce number of function calls (speed) Reduce number of objects/string generate (speed and memory) Allow the verify method to be &#39;yanked out&#39; of the source file with out dependencies on other methods Improve clarity of the algorithms. Frequently the computation of the check digits is tricky, while the verification is very clear. JavaAll check schemes implement the CheckDigit interface. </p>

<p>Extensive Junit tests exist in the com.modp.checkdigits.test package. </p>

<p>Javadoc code is in the java/doc directory. </p>

<p>JavaScriptThe javascript versions follow the java code fairly closely. However, the javascript objects do not formally use an interface or use inheritance. They are effectively static classes. </p>

<p>Extensive unit tests exist in the javascript/test directory. Just open the html files in your browser to run the tests. </p>

<p>NOTE: The core of the unit test is based from jsunit, but the test runner is custom. Need to split out the new runner and document it.</p>

 title : The cripton Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&quot;Group communications&quot; has become increasingly important in many network applications. With this arises the challenge of efficient group management algorithms. This includes providing confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and scalability. Though the technical issues of securing unicast communications has been well understood, the technical issues of securing group communications are not. An important part of secure group communications is scalability, which can be costly when large dynamic groups are involved. Previous attempts to solve this problem, have had communication cost proportional to the number of clients. In this project, we model the system using &quot;key graphs&quot;. This model induces a hierarchy in the group of clients leading to subgroups(group within groups) and so on. There exists at least a  two level hierarchy ,groups of workstations  forming one level of hierarchy and individual workstations forming the other. Operations like a client joining or leaving a group( or a subgroup) now reduce to set of operations on the key graph like finding the descendants of a node in the graph, finding the set of leaves in a tree, finding the minimal covering set. These algorithms enable us to achieve a communication cost proportional to logarithm of the number of clients. It also helps us to achieve scalability i.e.., perform efficiently when a large number of clients are involved.</p>
 title : The cryptobyn Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an encryptation paradigm based in random filters that make grow the complexity of the encrypted text in a exponential way. </p>

<p>Introduction
<br/>Nowadays cryptographic messages are really important for communications through the web. In cryptography, encryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext) using an algorithm (called cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge, usually referred to as a key. The result of the process is encrypted information (in cryptography, referred to as ciphertext). In many contexts, the word encryption also implicitly refers to the reverse process, decryption, to make the encrypted information readable again (i.e. to make it unencrypted).</p>

 title : The csharpmudserver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MUD.NetMUD.Net started as a test project to learn the new .Net 3.5 asynchronous sockets pattern. When testing that initial code, I used MUSHClient and it made me a tad nostalgic for ye olde MUDs. So, I figured, why not, there&#39;s a lot of other patterns and techniques I don&#39;t have in my repertoire. Why not work on them here? </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a fun ride, a ride that continues today. This site will host public releases of the MUD.Net source. All releases on this site are subject to the MIT License restrictions, which is to say not much. Use it as you like.  </p>

<p>Note about licensing and &quot;Insurrection&quot;As the above statement implies, I am NOT using this respository for development. I have my own, private, repo that I&#39;m using for that, and the only thing that will be available here are milestone snapshots, major and minor releases, and if there&#39;s enough interest perhaps weekly snapshots. I&#39;m basically doing that so I can keep the actively developed codebase in a perpetually branched state as far as this license is concerned. If I decide to go ahead and use it for profit or sell it to someone who will, that remains my decision. For the purposes of keeping these two codebases separate, I&#39;m calling the private branch &quot;Insurrection,&quot; after the MUD that will be hosted by that name, both as a production MUD and as a feature showcase. Link forthcoming when I manage to get said game up and running.</p>
 title : The csquickusb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Generally, CSQuickUSB is a library that exposes access to USB hardware manufactured by Bitwise Systems (http://www.bitwisesys.com). Essentially allowing full featured interop with a USB 2.0 port and hardware of an external device, all from an easy to use C#/managed landscape. </p>

<p>DownloadTo download the latest release, go to the Downloads Page. For nightly builds see the SVN repository. </p>

<p>BackgroundBitwise Systems manufactures a USB module called QuickUSB which provides all the features of a full USB 2.0 system, but is very easy to integrate with existing hardware. However, at the time, the API to access the device is poorly designed and sparsely documented. In short, I wish I had went with the Cypress solutions instead. </p>

<p>Out of the box it comes with an unmanaged wrapper library called quickusb.dll, which wraps all the necessary Windows API calls to successfully preform USB 2.0 communication with the hardware. With that in mind, all CSQuickUSB is, is a wrapper of quickusb.dll, that is much easier to use and performs all the necessary win32 marshaling for full managed environment access to the hardware on the other side of the USB cable. </p>

<p>For examples on how to use the CsQuickUSB library see the UsageExamples wiki page</p>

 title : The e-bibliophile Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>e-Bibliophile is the first iteration of a grammar and surrounding tools to make use of that grammar, targeting written media including but not limited to: Literature, Fiction, Essays, Articles, and Plays.  As such it is meant to focus on syntactical markup of those sorts of works, and not be a solution for all written works.  With a goal of only targeting the bulk of written materials (excluding things such as text books, mathematical formulae, technical documents, contractual agreements etc.) we have been able to come up with a concise grammar that is easy to read, and apply, with a minimum of arbitrary methods to properly mark up a single document. </p>

<p>The advantage?  By not being a solution for all things, we are able to provide an incredibly effective and dynamic solution to things that fall within the range of our target.  We are able to realize the sort of flexibility and separation of contextual/syntactical markup and style markup shown at projects like CSS Zen Garden, and has been talked about at the W3 consortium for over a decade now. </p>

<p>e-Bibliophile as a piece of software centers around a &quot;what you see is what you mean&quot; (wysiwym) document markup gui, an IDE like text based editor for manual editing of the document and the associated CSS type documents, and an IDE like editor to &quot;tweak&quot; the processing engine&#39;s output.  It also features interfaces to convert images into text, the facilities to then check the accuracy of the document, and tools to refer back to the original document throughout the markup process.  For documents that are originally composed inside e-Bibliophile there are also many algorithms that will assist in checking for consistency of spelling non-standard non-dictionary words, as well as checking to assess the difficulty for readers to understand the document. </p>

<p>News1-26-2009 Finally finished the first draft of the markup language.  Work has started on prototyping the system we will be using to keep all of the parts of the application synchronized. </p>

<p>12-28-2008 Xmas is over, new years is just around the corner, and energy towards e-Bibliophile is ramping up.  Our main developer is going to have more time to start working on making this project a reality starting in less than 2 weeks.  We have also had a few &quot;nibbles&quot; from other developers who are interested in making our dream a reality.  Documenting the last few parts of the grammar is proving to be more difficult that expected, but getting this right up front is more important than getting words on a sheet. </p>

<p>12-12-2008 The grammar is almost completely outlined. The only major hurdles left are Images, Cites, and Notes.  We have decided that will will set up an event driven parser, that will allow LARGE amounts of flexibility for any document compliant to this grammar, so that as we work on the GUI, members of the e-book community can use the markup to format books. </p>

<p>11-17-2008 We have spent significant time working on the grammar and scope of the markup language.  Coding may start as soon as January 2009.  If all goes well we should have a functional program by Q3 of 2009.  </p>

<p>10-28-2008 Real life, wedding planning, work, twins and plenty of other things have slowed down initial development of the project, but it is far from dead. </p>

<p>4-10-2008 We are currently refining the set of tags/data model that we are going to employ in the application.  Code modeling and GUI design to follow shortly there after.</p>

 summary : <p>简述   </p>

<p>我们所做的是一个基于Mapobjects的开源的GPS车俩监控系统。系统分为四个部分，GPS网关模拟系统、车辆轨迹记录系统、地图配置系统和车辆监控系统。 
<br/>1、GPS车辆监控系统 </p>

<p>主要用来对车辆进行实时位置跟踪，在电子地图上显示其所在位置。但其长远目的是为以后可以在该系统平台上构建复杂的业务系统而构建一个基础平台，因此在保证系统有较高的使用效率和友好的交互性能之外，还具有很好的可扩充性。 
<br/>2、地图配置系统： 主要用来配置地图数据，创建地图的工程文件。 
<br/>3、GPS网关模拟系统： 模拟车辆位置信息发送，为车辆监控系统和轨迹记录系统提供实时的数据源，他们之间通过UDP网络协议来进行通信。 
<br/>4、轨迹记录系统 实时保存车辆数据到数据库中，以便在车辆监控系统需要对特定车辆进行轨迹回放时为其提供车辆历史轨迹数据。 </p>

<p>特点 1、使用优化的数据缓存技术保证了系统的实时性和高效率 2、使用了基于时间差值的轨迹回放算法，能根据历史轨迹数据精确模拟车辆行驶速度 3、采用两种监控模式（web模式和桌面模式），保证数据源同步，为用户提供选择空间 </p>

<p>ps:本项目采用visual studio .net 2005 和 ESRI mapobjects 2.4平台开发。    </p>

 summary : <p>This project provides an convenient abstraction over flash.net.Socket. With this module, you can use arbitrary network services hosted on the server. </p>

<p>As a backend, it uses a small flash movie that does the actual data transfer. </p>

<p>One of the limitations imposed by the single-threaded nature of ActionScript3 is the fact that you only get non-blocking sockets, which can prove harder to use. </p>

<p>As an example, we provide a simple POP3 protocol implementation. </p>

 title : The hackystat-sensor-tfs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionTeam Foundation Server(TFS) is a Microsoft application framework used to manage teams working on group projects. It includes source control, build, reporting and ticking services. The Visual Studio Team Foundation Server Hackystat Sensor is a web service application that combines the Eventing Service provided by TFS along with the TFS API to intercept, extract and record development information sent through Team Foundation Server in near real-time. This information is then processed and sent to a Hackystat database for further analysis by other tools in the Hackystat Framework. </p>

<p>By creating a Hackystat sensor which will collect development process data for the VS Team Foundation Server, developers and team leaders would be able to utilize all the information gained throughout a project to their advantage. Instead of simply viewing the number of bugs fixed over time, they could use this information to identify common patterns that precede each bug. Developers could then use this information to better mold there individual design process. They could also use the information gained on previously similar projects to map out better development timelines for future ones. </p>

 summary : <p>The field of Distributed Computing has existed for many years, but has seen a recent surge in development as the prevalance of consumer electronics has increased. Distributed Computing is based on the principle that connected devices can achieve more. Many homes are now enabled with high speed wireless networking and devices, although these are simply members of a disjointed collection of gadgets. The ideas of intelligent spaces or Smart Environments try to remedy this disjointed nature using concepts from Distributed Computing. In this project we hope to implement a simple prototype demonstrating the advantages of such a system.</p>

 title : The lcm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>LCM is a library for message passing and data marshalling targeted at real-time systems where high-bandwidth and low latency are critical. It provides a publish/subscribe message passing model and an XDR-style message specification language with bindings for applications in C, Java, and Python. It was originally designed and used by the MIT DARPA Urban Challenge Team as its message passing system. </p>

<p>LCM is designed for tightly-coupled systems connected via a dedicated local-area network. It is not intended for message passing over the Internet. LCM has been developed for soft real-time systems: its default messaging model permits dropping messages in order to minimize the latency of new messages. </p>

<p>FeaturesLow-latency inter-process communication Efficient broadcast mechanism using UDP Multicast Provides type-safe message marshaling that automatically detects most types of errors (such as version mismatches between different modules) User-friendly logging and playback  Essentially unlimited packet size No centralized &quot;database&quot; or &quot;hub&quot; -- peers communicate directly No daemons Supports C/C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB RequirementsPOSIX.1-2001 system (GNU/Linux, OS X, Cygwin, Solaris, etc.) or Windows XP/Vista/7 GLib &gt;= 2.0 Java &gt;= 1.5 is strongly recommended, as several important utilities distributed with LCM are written in Java.

<p>Master 1 </p>

<p>Systèmes Multiprocesseurs, Algorithmes et Outils de Développement pour le Calcul Parallèle </p>

<p>Modules I et II </p>

<p>Jean-Marc Adamo , Professeur </p>

<p>Organisation de l&#39;enseignement </p>

<p>Cet enseignement est subdivisé en deux modules I et II qui se suivent sur le second semestre. Le module II est la suite du module I. Il est destiné à en compléter l&#39;enseignement. Pour suivre avec profit les enseignements du second module il est nécessaire d&#39;avoir suivi au préalable ceux du premier. </p>

<p>Objectifs </p>

<p>L&#39;usage des machines multiprocesseurs est devenu incontournable pour quiconque s&#39;intéresse aux applications nécessitant le recours au calcul intensif. Ces applications concernent à la fois la recherche scientifique publique ou privée, mais également les entreprises industrielles et commerciales. Ceci, traditionnellement, dans les domaines de l&#39;ingénieur mais aussi dans ceux de la finance. En témoigne, par exemple, la liste des segments de marché que DELL affiche dans les pages Web présentant ses produits dédiés au calcul intensif : «There are numerous computing intensive problems that require high performance computing power. Since High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) is one of the most cost effective architecture to solve these problems, it is highly prevalent in the academic and research environments as well as in industrial and government segments. Some of the generic usages for the HPCC are in: • Bio-Medical and Genomics • Computer Aided Engineering, Design, and Simulation • Geopetroleum: Seismic data processing, Reservoir analysis, simulation, and visualization • Computational Finance and Modeling • Material Science Research and Development • Parallel rendering» Cet enseignement présente le domaine du calcul intensif sous ses différents aspects : matériels, algorithmes et logiciels de développement d&#39;application. </p>

<p>Dans une première partie, après avoir parcouru l&#39;histoire des architectures dans la période des 10 dernières années, je présente quelques architectures parmi celles proposées à l&#39;heure actuelle sur le marché. </p>

<p>Puis, je m&#39;intéresse à dégager les mesures qui caractérisent les notions de l&#39;accélération d&#39;un calcul et de l&#39;expansion des moyens de calcul par multiplication du nombre de processeurs utilisés (scalabilité). Je montre que, en général, on ne peut pas espérer améliorer indéfiniment le temps d&#39;exécution d&#39;un algorithme en augmentant indéfiniment le nombre de processeurs. Ce sont des connaissances qu&#39;il est nécessaire d&#39;avoir lorsque l&#39;on s&#39;intéresse au calcul parallèle, de la même manière qu&#39;il faut avoir des idées claires sur la complexité des algorithmes séquentiels lorsqu&#39;on a le métier d&#39;en faire usage. </p>

<p>Dans une troisième partie, je présente un outil de développement de programmes parallèles (librairie ARCH dérivée de MPI) et les différents modèles qu&#39;il contient : coroutines, communication synchrones, communications asynchrones, lecture – écriture distantes, communication - synchronisation collectives, I/O parallèles. Cette présentation prélude à l&#39;utilisation de la librairie pour le développement concret, sur le cluster de stations de travail du bâtiment 710, de codes parallèles pour divers algorithmes qui sont exposés dans le cours d&#39;algorithmique. </p>

<p>Le cours d&#39;algorithmique fait l&#39;objet de la quatrième partie de cet enseignement. J&#39;ai fait le choix de présenter les algorithmes parallèles de tri ainsi que les algorithmes parallèles associés aux grands problèmes dans les graphes. J&#39;ai volontairement omis les algorithmes matriciels car ils sont, en général, très documentés dans la littérature spécialisée (et d&#39;un accès simple à l&#39;issue de cet enseignement). </p>

<p>Dans une cinquième partie, je présente des algorithmes apportant des solutions à deux problèmes importants du calcul distribué: l&#39;exclusion mutuelle et la terminaison distribuée. Il est parfois nécessaire d&#39;en faire usage dans certaines mises en œuvres sophistiquées. </p>

<p>Enfin, une très large part de l&#39;enseignement est faite à la participation active des étudiants à travers la réalisation de travaux personnels sur le cluster des stations de travail du bâtiment 710. </p>

 title : The mysql-message-api Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The MySQL Message API is a set of User-Defined Functions (UDFs) that enable MySQL database servers to send and receive messages across a network. They allow MySQL users to do this using simple SQL queries, like this one</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SELECT send_mesg(&#39;orders&#39;, &#39;two eggs over easy&#39;)</p>

<p>which would send the message &#39;two eggs over easy&#39; to all the members of a message group named &#39;orders.&#39;</p>

<p>A message group is a set whose members might include other MySQL users on the same server or on other MySQL servers. Messages might be sent by a trigger on one database server whenever a particular table is updated, and processed by a long-running stored procedure on another server. The membership of a group may also include applications written in PHP, Perl, Java, or many any other langauages. The group&#39;s members might all be on a local area network, or could be distributed around the Internet.</p>

<p>The messages are delivered by the Spread Toolkit, a high-performance Open Source messaging platform that can employ the most efficient possible combination of IP broadcast, multicast, UDP, and TCP protocols for any network topology.</p>

 summary : <p>pacman is one of the most essential tools in ArchLinux, similar to aptget in debian, and the others that almost every linux distribution has.</p>

<p>One of its failings is that it gets all packages from a series of mirror servers.  This situation works, but does not make it easy to dynamically download packages from the fastest server.</p>

<p>This project aims to provide a p2p layer that allows packages to be retrieved from a large distribution of users and servers.</p>

<p>An advantages from businesses on a LAN is that a single package server can be used as a proxy/cache for accessing the packages from outside of the LAN.  This reduces downloading and speeds up internal package updates from multiple installations.</p>

<p>Web Service for Small and Medium Enterprises Community software for Non Profits Free and Open Source Software PANTOTO model is especially useful in sectors such as social development, schools, and small and medium size organizations: </p>

<p>These organizations work directly with beneficiaries, capture, create and work intensively with data, information and knowledge. Dependency on technical professionals to build information management systems causes delays. The cost of hiring such professionals and related resources also makes the effort unsustainable. Equitability can arise when organizations can create, maintain and deal with information management systems by themselves. Based on these factors, if IT is to be used, organizations have to be empowered to: </p>

<p>Take the design, implementation and maintenance of an information management system for granted and not necessarily have to acquire IT skills or hire IT professionals. Redesign or evolve the system based on changing information needs Build solutions that are easy-to-use, affordable and quick to deploy Use the same process across projects and in different areas Manage the participatory creation of locally relevant and locally created content FOSS/FLOSS </p>

 title : The pogmrs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>For all intents and purposes a thought exercise in implementing reliable data communications over cheap radio hardware with as little external circuitry as possible. Ideally i/o will be done using the sound card thus allowing implementation over a wider variety of mediums. I do foresee controlling transmission being an issue that may only be solved by breaking open a radio, but that is a bridge to cross later. Again, this is a thought experiment. Any implementation which violates any laws is the sole responsibility of the implementor.</p>
 title : The pokerspot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pokerspot was a commercial online real-money gaming site launched in 2000.  7 years later, we&#39;re opensourcing our software with pure intent to lower the barrier to entry to the current market, hopefully introducing more competition to a fairly monopolized industry, thus putting the power back in the hands of the people.  This software should be used for fun, play-money games, or commercially.  Do with it as you see fit.  Perhaps a community will evolve around it, and we can effect positive societal change through new technologies (or at least &#39;rake free&#39; poker).</p>

 title : The pydtvcmd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>INTRODUCTION&#39;dtvcmd&#39; is a program to send commands via your computer&#39;s serial port to a DirecTV(tm) satellite television receiver.  With it, you can mimic the functionality of an infrared remote control.  Not all DTV receivers support serial communications. </p>

<p>&#39;dtvremote&#39; is a pyGTK GUI for controlling the receiver from the desktop. </p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE:  This project has absolutely NOTHING to do with signal theft or circumvention.  Do not make inquiries about “hacking” your system.  I don&#39;t know how nor would I help you if I did. </p>

<p>Direct TV is a trademark of Direct TV, Cartoon Network is a trademark of Cartoon Network, other trademarks are property of their respective owners, water is wet.     </p>

<p>CONVENTIONSI&#39;ll say &#39;Linux&#39; in this document often as that is what I use, but the python language is platform independent it&#39;s very likely this script will work on other operating systems. </p>

<p>We&#39;re going to assume you know your way around you computer.  Knowledge of the python programming language is not required.  It&#39;s a great language though!       </p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS Direct TV(tm) satellite TV receiver with functional serial interface (not all have them and not all that do work)  A PC with an available serial port  A custom serial cable with proper pinout  A not horribly old release of Python  The PySerial package from pyserial.sourceforge.net installed  Python &gt;= 2.3 (www.python.org)  pyGTK &gt;= 2.0 (www.pygtk.org)   </p>

<p>CUSTOM CABLE(Need info here) </p>

<p>QUICK INSTALLATION$ cd ~/bin $ wget http://pydtvcmd.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dtvcmd $ wget http://pydtvcmd.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dtvremote $ chmod +x dtvcmd dtvremote </p>

<p>You will probably want to edit &#39;dtvremote&#39; to set up the correct serial port and preset channel buttons. </p>

<p>You will probably have to add yourself to the &#39;uucp&#39; group for non-root access to the serial port or CHMOD the port and make it read/write-able for others.  You may also have to jump through hoops to make SELinux happy.    </p>

<p>COMMAND LINE REFERENCE (for dtvcmd)-d {device} 	 Always required.  Specifies which system device to use for serial communications – i.e. the port the serial cable is connected to.  For Linux systems, serial port A is typically /dev/ttyS0 and serial port B is /dev/ttyS1.  For Windows, I think using &#39;0&#39; will select port A and &#39;1&#39; will select port B or &#39;COM1&#39; and &#39;COM2&#39; may work. </p>

<p>-c {channel} </p>

<p>Set the channel to the value N.  This example switches the receiver to Cartoon Network:   </p>

<p>dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -c 296 </p>

<p>-m [1|2] </p>

<p>Sets the command mode.  Default is &#39;1&#39;, old command set.  Use &#39;-m 2&#39; to communicate with the receiver using the &#39;new&#39; command set. As explained by  Andy Ellsworth: 					 </p>

<p>“Newer RCA receivers incorporate changes to the serial control protocol, which renders them incompatible with previous versions of the serial control standard. (I originally believed that this was some evil ploy by RCA, but it appears to be a necessary change in order to comply with the APG (Advanced Program Guide) standard from DirecTV--mea culpa.)” </p>

<p>http://www.dar.net/~andy/tivo/rca_dss_serial.html </p>

<p>RCA models DRD4xxRG &amp; RH (among others) seem to use the new command set.  If your unit was purchased within the last four years, it probably uses the new commands. Please note: As of this writing, I have NOT tested communications using the &#39;-m 2&#39; option.  My receiver uses the old command set so there was much guessing and crossing of fingers. </p>

<p>This example tells the receiver, using the new command set, to switch to Cartoon Network(tm): </p>

<p>dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -m 2 -c 296         </p>

<p>-T 		 Return the receiver&#39;s datetime in the format &#39;MMDDhhmmCCYY.ss&#39;.  You can sync your PC&#39;s clock with your receiver with the following command (as root):   </p>

<p>date dtvcmd.py -d /dev/ttyS0 -T -p [on|off] </p>

<p>Turns the receiver&#39;s power on or off.  Unlike the power button on a remote, this is NOT a toggle so sending two power ON request wont turn the receiver off again.  If you are capturing TV shows via a cron script, adding &#39;-p on&#39; is probably a good idea.  The following example turns the receiver on and switches the channel to Cartoon Network: </p>

<p>dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -p on -c 296 </p>

<p>-i [enable|disable] </p>

<p>Enable or disable whether the receiver should process input from from a real infrared remote control.  NOTE: Check if this resets after a power off? </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -i disable </p>

<p>-b {arg} </p>

<p>Mimic pressing the corresponding button.  If you want to do multiple button presses, prefix each with a &#39;-b&#39;.  Valid buttons are: </p>

<p>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, alt_audio, info, dss, menu_select, guide, up, down, left, right, channel_up, channel_down, &amp; prev_channel </p>

<p>The following example advances the channel twice (and like a remote, it will use your selected favorite list for the channel order): </p>

<p>dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -b channel_up -b channel_up  </p>

<p>-v </p>

<p>Verbose mode.  Under normal operation, DTVcmd.py operates in ninja-like silence, only responding to get channel, get signal strength, or get datetime commands.  To break the omerta, use -v and it will be all kinds of chatty.  Each line begins with “DTVcmd.py ...” so you can tell who is complaining in your scripts.  Example: </p>

<p>$ dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -v -m 2 -i disable </p>

<p>Reponds with: </p>

<p>dtvcmd verbose on dtvcmd Communicating on device /dev/ttyS0 dtvcmd Using new command set dtvcmd IR remote disabled </p>

<p>-t &#39;message&#39; </p>

<p>Shows text on the screen.  On my DRD303A, it ignores any message longer than 15 characters and the message to stay for 5 mins or until I press a button on the remote that changes the display in some fashion.  See the &#39;-h&#39; option for removing the text. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short script that displays a message for X seconds.  Let&#39;s say you had a  program to return caller ID data, then you could use something like this to display who&#39;s calling on the TV.   </p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env bash # usage:  dtv_showtext.sh “{message}” {duration in seconds} MSG=$1 DELAY=$2 dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -t “$MSG” sleep $DELAY dtvcmd -d /dev/ttyS0 -h </p>

<p>$ dtv_showtext.sh “555-1212” 5 </p>

 summary : <p>ShortCircuitA puzzle game involving the creation of circuits from falling blocks. </p>

<p>Updates5/02/08 - Beta Release (Build 84) is now available.  Some major bugs have been fixed, but sound has not yet been implemented, but you can expect to see that in the next release! 4/29/08 - ShortCircuit Alpha Release is now available for download!  Click on the Featured Downloads link on the right of this page to download.  You must unzip the folder and run Alpha Release.exe. 4/27/08 - Looking for ShortCircuit alpha testers!  E-mail me at lewi.kevin.k@gmail.com if you are interested, please. How To PlayNote: (Interactive Instructions can be found within the How To Play section of the game) </p>

<p>ShortCircuit is played by switching blocks or moving blocks to the top of any column.  To select a block, simply click on it.  Clicking again will cause the block to be deselected, while clicking on another area will cause the block to move. </p>

<p>Blocks differ by their engraved patterns.  These patterns can form part of a path, allowing the paths of adjacent blocks to connect, forming a larger path.  A group of blocks is cleared when their path connects the left wall to the right wall. </p>

<p>After a group of blocks is cleared, the blocks above them will fall.  This allows for multiple sets of blocks to be cleared in only one move.  Doing this is sometimes necessary in Puzzle Mode and will earn bonus points in Endless Mode.  Powerups can be collected throughout the game.  When a Powerup is obtained, the user can select it by clicking on the icon and then activate it by clicking anywhere on the game screen. </p>

<p>ShortCircuit can be played in three modes.  In Puzzle Mode, the user has a certain number of moves to clear a certain number of blocks.  In Endless Mode, blocks randomly fall and the game ends when a column of blocks reaches the top.  In Multiplayer Mode, two players can play against each other over a network.  More Powerups are available in this mode. </p>

 title : The sirbot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Programming a bot is done writing a Python class, thanks to the SirBot API. A protocol declaration syntax is used to define what can be done (primitive/complex actions). Using a Python CLI, the robot can be interactively controlled and dynamically programmed. While the bot is performing several actions, every piece of information is able to produce events, thanks to the event declaration syntax. Events can also be created from other events (cascading events), conditionnaly triggered under specific conditions (pre-condition), and activate user-defined actions (post-conditions) according to a particular event state. The SirBot Module library provides detailed instructions to build electronic boards (PIC-based) and connect them to build a robot.</p>

<p>General Thoughts: Currently I&#39;m thinking about building a Java-based filesharing-tool. Features it should have are: </p>

<p>Client to server data transfers (FTP like) Client to client data transfers (like &quot;send file&quot;-function in many common chat programs) Multiple clients to client data transfer (P2P like) Fully (ssl?) encrypted data transfers maybe inside a tunnel-like structure Closed community support. Some authentification method (password/keyfile) required for even seeing what is beeing shared. Communication between Peers or many Peers (Direct Chat, Multi User Chat)</p>

 title : The usdis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>(New! Sep. 27, 2008) Some materials illustrating the work have be uploaded and labled as 4.1 through 4.5. They include:  </p>

<p>2 conference papers,  a presentation ppt accompanying the papers, and  2 video clips that demonstrate the usage of the two clients. </p>

<p>USDIS(Uniform Semantic Data Integration System) is a Java project origigating from our research work in Semantic Web &amp; Web Serivces. It&#39;s a dynamic data integration system, which integrates both RDF data sources and information-providing Web Services.  At runtime the queries posed by the user against the domain ontology result in dynamic invocations of the matched Web Services as well as evaluation of SPARQL queries on RDF datasets. A successful experiment on the public Amazon E-Commerce Service has shown the great usability and generality of the system. </p>

<p>The arctecture of the system is :  </p>

<p>There are 2 runnable classes at present:  </p>

<p>cn.edu.bupt.usdis.ui.DataQueryClient  cn.edu.bupt.usdis.ui.DataSourceMgmtClient  The former is to perform data query. And the latter is to create semantic description (i.e. Uniform Query) of a Data Source and bind it with underlying Web Services or SPARQL endpoint(at present only single local RDF file is supported). They both have a GUI. </p>

<p>As a demo facility, there is a naive travel&amp;book ontology and 2 data sources contained in the distribute package. The data source No.4 is the Amazon book search &quot;data source&quot; which can result in a real time Amazon Web Service call to search books by topic. Try it from DataQueryClient and enjoy it! </p>

<p>A snapshot of the data query formulation GUI:  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A snapshot of the Web Service annotation GUI - on the ItemSearch operation of Amazon E-Commerce Service (ECS): </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note the array index in the expression for element path used here can take 2 special values:  </p>

<p>&#39;*&#39; is used to allow the Web Service to return multiple records which is a common case in data query. Certainly there are at most one &#39;*&#39; appeared in an element and its position - notated as &quot;fork point&quot; - must be same in all elements which have a fork point. &quot;..&quot; is allowed to be appeared in an array that is at the right-most node of an element path, which is to indicate the concatenation  of all members of that array (separated by &quot;, &quot;). In all other cases, only &#39;0&#39; is permitted for simplicity.  </p>

<p>A snapshot of result to the query - “list books about ‘Semantic Web’ and published since 2006”.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note the results come from both the Amazon Web Service and a local RDF dataset. You see the data is really Integrated! </p>

<p>In backend and background, the data flow inside USDIS, especially the procedure of registering a Web Service and the mechanism of dynamic invocation of Web Services, is shown below: </p>

 summary : <p>This is a simple to extend wxWidgets based multiple state control. A good example of what a &#39;multi-state&#39; control is a led. With this control you can set your states and then toggle them as you see fit. Included it the package is wxLed, wxMultiState, and wxPassFail.</p>

<p>wxLed is a good looking, highly configurable led control. It has many uses such as:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- showing transmit/receive communications.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- easy way to toggle state with a clear visual representation.</p>

<p>wxMultiState is an advanced wxStateCtrl. It will allow you to have an infinite amount of states and also select your own image to display in each of the states. This means that the control could react to the users button push as well as change the state pragmatically. This will be a good control if you want ultimate control of how your control reacts to the user of your program.</p>

<p>wxPassFail is a really simple control that just has two/three states, a background color, and text that is displayed. It does just what its name implies, it shows the user if something &#39;Passed&#39; or &#39;Failed&#39;.</p>

Zangerland does NOT aim to be a modern visual game, but rather to take game design and extreme game architecture ideas to the next level. Even todays mud games still use 20 year old code bases with outdated communications mechanism and archaic storage schemes. Zangerland will use modern MySQL databases on fast hardware to create a near infinite game world and great capacity for expansion. The front end will use modern, accessible browser technologies to create real time interfaces into the game world. Several layers of interfaces are planned, including traditional text interfaces and visual, AJAX based interfaces.</p>

 title : The funkscript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Funk is a scripting language that is very simple at it&#39;s core: It has functions (as values), pattern matching and real variables. That&#39;s it - the rest is just nice notation for defining different kinds of functions - every value is a function. Object oriented programming is implemented via pattern matching, and the notation is shorter than most other dynamic (and static) languages. </p>

<p>Implementation statusThe current implementation is written in the OCaml language and translates the language into OCaml. It also requires ExtLib. Please use a Subversion client to check out the source if you want to play around with it. Modules and standard libraries are not implemented at this point, since I&#39;m thinking about moving the language to the Neko platform and use NekoML instead of OCaml. </p>

<p>I am currently working on a new vesion of Funk, which simplifies the existing syntax and adds optional type annotations (with inference). I hope to release a new version late this year (2009). </p>

<p>A short introductionThe details aren&#39;t entirely accurate, see the Reference for specifics. </p>

<p>:fib {
<br/>    |0| 0
<br/>    |1| 1
<br/>    |n| fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
<br/>}This is a naive implementation of the Fibonacci function (returns element n in the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...). It uses a simple form of pattern matching: if the argument matches the pattern 0, that is, if it is zero, the function returns zero. If the argument matches 1, it returns one, and otherwise it calls itself to find the answer. </p>

<p>:point {|x y| { 
<br/>    |X| x
<br/>    |Y| y
<br/>    |Add p| point(x + p.X, y + p.Y)
<br/>    |ToString| &quot;(&quot;..x..&quot;, &quot;..y..&quot;)&quot;
<br/>}}The above is a constructor function that constructs a point (x, y). The first thing to notice is the |x y| pattern. It simply says that the parameter takes two arguments, x and y. The interesting part is what it returns - a new object. This new object has methods X and Y that returns the x and y that the constructor was called with (notice that those arguments are never forgotten in the entirety of the constructed objects lifetime). </p>

<p>The Add method takes an argument p, which is a point, and returns a new point with coordinates that are the sums of the individual coordinates of this point and the p point. The ToString method simply returns a nice string representation of the point. </p>

<p>:p1 point(5, 7)    # let p1 be the point (5, 7)
<br/>:p2 point(2, 3)    # let p2 be the point (2, 3)
<br/>print p1.X         # prints &quot;5&quot;
<br/>print p1.Add(p2)   # prints &quot;(7, 10)&quot;This example shows the basics of how to define variables and how to call methods (oh yeah, and line comments begin with a hash (#) and are ignored). Apart from the colon syntax for defining variables, it should be straightforward if you already know OOP. If not, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll explain it without reference to OOP later on. </p>

<p>There are no keywords in Funk. No if, no while and no print. The if statement has what must seem like a rather peculiar replacement in this language: </p>

<p>(x &gt; 42).Then({print &quot;x is great!&quot;})As you may have guessed, this reads &quot;if x is greater than 42, then print &gt;&gt;x is great!&lt;s an unusual implementation.</p>

 title : The heron-language Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HeronHeron is a new general purpose programming language that aims to make large scale programming easier, faster, and safer, while also being appropriate for small scale programming tasks.  </p>

<p>Heron has a syntax which resembles Java, C#, and ECMAScript (especially ActionScript). Heron is primarily an object-oriented language, but borrows many ideas from functional languages, and even some from array-oriented languages.  </p>

<p>Distinguishing CharacteristicsThe following are some of the more notable features of Heron </p>

<p>Modules can be instantiated more than once    Built-in concurrent list operations  Variant types Signature-based polymorphism (i.e. duck typing) Optional type signatures Advanced compile-time programming support  Interfaces  Heron is also notable in its explicit non-support for certain language features, which are mostly redundant because of the features listed above.  </p>

<p>No predefined visibility specifiers  No run-time reflection  No assignment to null by default  No universal base type (e.g. &#39;Object&#39;)  No virtual functions No downcasts (i.e. casting from a Base type to a Derived type) No virtual functions No static data No global data The Heron InterpreterThis project provides the source code and executable for an interpreter for Heron written in C# using .NET 4.0. As a language, Heron is in no way tied to the common language run-time or the Windows Platform. Heron can be ported to any platform with relative ease.   </p>

 summary : <p>WelcomeThanks for coming to this project. This is an native iPhone application that use the language packs that packaged by glen.tw (see below for the translation credit) which allow user to change the display language on the iPhone. </p>

<p>This will break your 1.1.1 phone DO NOT INSTALLplease read this if you accidentally run iLang on 1.1.1 </p>

<p>Install InstructionFor 1.1.1 User With 1.1.1, you can enable the international setting by doing the following: </p>

<p>enable international keyboard</p>

<p>/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/M68AP.plist
<br/>international</p>

<p>change that to
<br/>international
<br/>There is no need to use iLang software in this case. However 1.1.1 doesn&#39;t have translation for most of the applications. Please check here for an updated language pack for 1.1.1, thanks. </p>

<p>This is NOT tested with 1.1.1 migaja leave a note stated this work with 1.1.1 for Spanish. Please add comment to that issue list, if you have tested it with 1.1.1 (working or not) Thanks. </p>

<p>Goto http://glassicstyle.com/iphone/ from your iPhone Safari. And add the source to your AppTapp Installer. Then goto Installer and install System/LanguagePack. </p>

<p> I got this image from http://www.iconarchive.com/, if anyone find or have a better icon, please let me know. I would like to change it, &#39;cause this is really for dictionary. :) </p>

<p>You can read more about my experience for creating this and other applications on my blog </p>

<p>BTW, given the screenshoot for the new firmware v1.1.1, it&#39;s known they going to have an international section to allow user to switch language. I think this will still be useful at least for the beginning they are not going to have Chinese supported. So this allow user to use Chinese characters. But also, this is simple app for me to learn more about iPhone and create other application in the future. :)  </p>

<p>Update: I&#39;ve check out the iPod Touch today and see the new settings with the change of different language (include chinese). So, most probably after the firmware upgrade, this application will not be needed anymore. But it&#39;s cool to write this for myself as a training session.  </p>

<p>Update(10-1-2007): My friend just update the firmware to 1.1.1, and in the settings there is no international options available, so I guess probably more people going to like this application. There I am going to test the PXL and release it to AppTapp. </p>

<p>LanguagePack 1.2Include the new language pack from glen.tw (0.6.1) http://www.hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3196 Czech from De3mKa Vietnamese from Minh Tran new icon from Wayne Zhou Add /bin/cp to language pack, no longer need to add BSD Sub System. LanguagePack 1.1Updated LanguagePack with the package from glen.tw (0.6.0). This version also fix the &quot;Now Playing&quot; image issue. </p>

<p>LanguagePack 1.0Download the PXL and install it with iBrickr or Breezy. This include the language pack (0.4.1) and the iLang.app </p>

<p>Instructionupload and unzip the languagepackage.zip to your iPhone root (/). If you have use scp, try this : # unzip -d tmp languagepackage.zip
<br/># cd tmp
<br/># scp -r * root@iphone-ip:/then unzip iLang.zip, and scp iLang.app to /Applications restart springboard. The reason I didn&#39;t release it in PXL is because I don&#39;t see the need for this app after firmware version 1.1.1 So, for the mean time just put it out there for those who might need to use it. </p>

<p>Version 0.2.1fix the preference file, use bundle string to store Unicode string for the language name. Version 0.2updated the language selection with the language name rather than code. finish the current language simply using the localized.string fix the locale for chinese to zh_TW and zh_CN. instead of reboot, restart the spring board. Version 0.1By launching LangChooser, you can choose which language you want, and it will restart the iPhone. The list of language is coming from LangChooser.app/preferences/, you can manually remove the file you don&#39;t need to shorten the list.</p>

 summary : <p>SwarmA Cellular Programming Language </p>

<p>  Greg Bramble gmb2106@columbia.edu </p>

<p>Thomas Chau tc2165@columbia.edu </p>

<p>Jason Gluckman jbg2113@columbia.edu </p>

<p>Rajesh Ramakrishnan rr2318@columbia.edu </p>

<p>AbstractSwarm is a functional dataflow language aimed at building simulations. Its programs are represented by directed graphs of cells. Cells, the basic functional unit, perform computation by responding to particular sets of stimuli and propagate reactions to their neighbors. To achieve a more intricate machine, a programmer must compose primitive cells into more complex ones, which in turn may be composed into yet larger units. </p>

<p>MotivationEverything in the world behaves in a cellular manner, participating in vast interactions in which units feel each others‟ influences and emit their own. For example, by universally speaking the language of electromagnetism, atoms compose many interesting molecules. These complexes then compose themselves into larger structures, giving rise to cells. The cells, on the next order of magnitude, act in concert and unite themselves by circulatory networks. Finally, humans, too, interact in a broad social framework and construct organizations to handle mass action. While much reductionist work has been done to probe basic properties of these systems‟ constituents, important applications in biology and social science rely on understanding aggregate behavior in general. Fortunately, the current trends in hardware are beginning to meet the needs of such systems where complexity arises from the synergy of many parallel elements.  </p>

<p>The days of the single processor are becoming history. They were characterized by programs which were essentially lists of instructions to be processed sequentially. Nearly all high-level languages in existence were written for and conceptually constrained by this paradigm. Even object-oriented programming, whose idea was to group instructions as more distinct entities, is firmly implanted in the original paradigm. While objects maintain their own states, they are nonetheless are filled with functions that must execute and return before the &quot;main&quot; function can continue. The OO paradigm more resembles a guideline for how to organize folders than a break from the procedural style that preceded it. As a consequence, we face a software crisis in which traditional languages have failed to capture parallel computation. We ask ourselves: how can we break away and write code to exploit new multiple processor technology? </p>

<p>GoalsThe goal of Swarm is to allow a programmer to explore emergent phenomena conveniently. But even more importantly, Swarm aims to establish a platform on which a programmer can write code that parallelizes naturally. Swarm&#39;s style is declarative, capturing the computation in a manner similar to that of functional languages. Its programs, rather than executing operations imperatively, define the juxtaposition of data and functionality explicitly. Swarm is a metalanguage whose operators perform high-level manipulations of the superstructure of a network of functional units. Swarm operators, when executed, link together these functional units, the cells, which provide conventional functionality.</p>

 title : The vy-language Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CJK Decomposition FileThe CJK Decomposition File is a graphical analysis of the most common 20,934 Chinese/Japanese characters in Unicode (the 20,922 characters in the Unicode CJK common ideograph block, plus the 12 unique characters from the CJK compatibility block). </p>

<p>For each character, I&#39;ve recorded one or two constituent components, and a decomposition type. Only pictorial configurations are used, not semantic ones. Where characters have typeface differences I&#39;ve used the one in the Unicode spec reference listing. When there&#39;s more than one possible configuration, I&#39;ve selected one only. I&#39;ve &quot;created&quot; a few thousand characters to cater for decomposition components not themselves among the collected characters. (Although many are in the CJK extension A and B blocks, I kept those out of scope.) To represent these extra characters in the data, sometimes I&#39;ve used a multi-character sequence, sometimes a user-defined glyph. </p>

<p>DownloadsThe download file is a zip containing 2 files: </p>

<p>(1) The CSV-format data file, with 4 fields: the character, first component, second component (or -), type of decomposition. </p>

<p>(2) The truetype font file to make viewing the data file easier. </p>

<p>LicenceThe CSV-format file is totally my own work, and distributed under both the Apache software licence 2.0 and LGPL licences. Although I used many internet-based listings to help create the data, there&#39;s no trace of them in the data file itself. </p>

<p>The font file is based on some pre-existing proprietary or copyleft font, and inherits that licence. </p>

<p>If you need to use the decomposition data in some BSD-style-licenced work, you can write a quick script to replace the user-defined glyphs with a unique multi-character identifying sequence. </p>

<p>Notes(1) This data has been used in Christoph Burgmer&#39;s CJKLib software. </p>

<p>(2) See my own ongoing progress on creating a CJK-character-based programming language at http://gavingrover.blogspot.com and http://code.google.com/p/groovyscript. </p>

 title : The django-appmedia Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Many times one would like to ship media (images, javascript, css, etc.) with a reusable django app (and many do). This can cause a number of problems for setting up the production and dev servers to serve up this data. Often this includes copying files, and editing templates to point to the new location somewhere under the MEDIA_ROOT. </p>

<p>appmedia solves these problems with: 1. template tags for generating the urls 2. httpd.conf directive generation 3. symlink generation (if you don&#39;t like option #2) 4. media serving under the dev server 5. settings.py overrides on multiple levels </p>

<p>A reusable app should have a &#39;media&#39; directory under it containing the media to be served (just like the django admin contrib app). This media directory can be overridden as described below. Reusable applications need not come with a media directory for appmedia to be used with them. In this way you can write smart templates and manage the media for each app cleanly. </p>

<p>There are two main template tags: </p>

<p>{% app_media_prefix &quot;myapp&quot; %}img/foo.jpg
<br/>{% app_media_url &quot;other.app&quot; &quot;img/bar.jpg&quot; %}Which could render as: </p>

<p>/media/myapp/img/foo.jpg
<br/>/media/other/app/img/bar.jpg?m=47fd0011and be mapped to the file locations </p>

<p>/usr/username/projects/apps/myapp/media/img/foo.jpg
<br/>/usr/username/eggs/other-1.0.egg/other/app/media/img/bar.jpgThe app_media_url tag will append the files modification time in hex form to the url to help with caching behaviors (quite useful for CSS). </p>

<p>appmedia creates an index of on disk media directories and the associated urls. These can then be used in the appmedia template tags. </p>

 summary : <p>The APDecorator class, and helpers, for processing arguments to views. </p>

<p>The APDecorator class is a general abstraction which allows the arguments to view functions to be altered before the view is called. Usually, due to the way Django handles its URLs, arguments parsed out via the URLconfs are passed as-is (as unaltered strings) to the view functions, whose job it then is to manipulate them (i.e. converting object ids to integers so they may be used to look up primary keys). APDecorator instances, and their enclosed APs, may be used to take some of the boilerplate code away from this. &#39;AP&#39; here stands for &#39;Argument Processor&#39;, as the job of these functions is to process the arguments to Django view functions.  </p>

<p>Usage of APDecorator may be summed up in the following three steps:      </p>

<p> Define your argument processors (APs). These are functions which should accept a variable number of positional and keyword arguments, and return a two-tuple of the altered positional and keyword arguments respectively. For example: </p>

<p>           def id_to_int(*args, **kwargs):
<br/>               p_kwargs = kwargs.copy()
<br/>               if &#39;id&#39; in p_kwargs:
<br/>                   p_kwargs[&#39;id&#39;] = int(p_kwargs[&#39;id&#39;])
<br/>               return args, p_kwargs Define your APDecorator instance, using an ordered sequence of APs. For example:            ap_decorator = APDecorator(
<br/>               id_to_int,
<br/>               some_other_ap,
<br/>               ...
<br/>           )Use this instance as a decorator for your Django view function. For example:            @ap_decorator
<br/>           def my_view(request, id=None):
<br/>               # do something here
<br/>               ...This module includes two validation functions which validate both a single AP and a set of APs. validate_processor and validate_processors may be given one and a sequence of APs respectively, and will return None if they are valid, and will raise an error otherwise.  </p>

<p>Also provided is a decorator function, no_request. This should be used on APs, not views, and will replace the APs with a wrapper function (with the same name and docstring) which will carry out the task of stripping the HTTP request from the positional arguments given to the AP, and then prepend it to the returned arguments afterwards. </p>

<p>An example use case for no_request is when you don&#39;t want your AP to alter the request object. Such alterations are preferably kept to Django middleware, and so an AP will want to restrict itself to altering the other positional and keyword arguments only. Say, for example, you wished to convert all positional arguments to integers. If we call int() on the request, an error will be raised. But, this means we need to separate the request out from the other positional arguments, and put it back on afterwards. no_request handles this for you. Without no_request, the function would look somewhat like this (boilerplate code is marked by a comment): </p>

<p>    def args_to_ints(*args, **kwargs):
<br/>        request, x_args = args[0], args[1:] # Boilerplate
<br/>        x_args = map(int, x_args)
<br/>        x_args = tuple([request] + x_args) # Boilerplate
<br/>        return x_args, kwargsWith no_request, it looks like this:: </p>

<p>    @no_request
<br/>    def args_to_ints(*args, **kwargs):
<br/>        return tuple(map(int, args)), kwargsThe function therefore becomes a simple line of code. In addition, when the function is called without a request as its first argument, then all arguments are passed as normal, again removing some of the boilerplate and stress from writing APs. For more information on using no_request, consult its docstring and source code. </p>

<p>Two AP factory functions are provided in this module. pos_filter is an AP factory which accepts a list index and a function as arguments (along with an optional name for the returned AP). An AP is returned which, when passed some positional arguments, tries (if there are enough) to replace the value at the specified index with the result of calling the function on the value at that index. The returned AP is also wrapped with no_request, meaning the request object is not modifiable, and that the 0th index is actually the first positional argument after the request. </p>

<p>An example use case for pos_filter could be coercing a string into an integer. This would be done like this: </p>

<p>    arg_to_int = pos_filter(0, int, name=&#39;arg_to_int&#39;)By using int as the filter function, it will be called on a string (which might be specified in the URLconf as something like r&#39;^([\d]+)/$&#39;) and should try to return an integer. </p>

<p>kw_filter is very similar in operation to pos_filter, only it accepts a keyword instead of a list index, and manipulates the keyword arguments passed through it. Let&#39;s assume that the URLconf looks like this: </p>

<p>    urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,    
<br/>        ...
<br/>        (r&#39;^(?P [\d]+)/$&#39;, my_app.my_view),
<br/>        ...
<br/>        )Here, named groups are used in the URLconf, which means the integer will be passed to my_view as a keyword argument (i.e. my_view(id=...)). In order to achieve the same as the previous pos_filter example, one would create an AP like this: </p>

<p>    arg_to_int = kw_filter(&#39;id&#39;, int, name=&#39;arg_to_int&#39;)As you can see, the index 0 has been replaced by the string &#39;id&#39;, and kw_filter is used instead of pos_filter. </p>

<p>As with all other APs, the functions returned by pos_filter and kw_filter may be grouped sequentially into APDecorator instances, and applied then to view functions. For more information on each of these functions, take a look at their respective docstrings and source code. </p>

<p>Finally, you will see a small example of a URLconf, a view, and an AP set which could be used to display info on an object. </p>

<p>To begin with, the URLconf: </p>

<p>    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
<br/>    
<br/>    urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;myapp&#39;,
<br/>        (r&#39;^/object/([\d]+)/$&#39;, views.details),
<br/>    )The AP definitions:: </p>

<p>    from myapp import models
<br/>    
<br/>    id_to_int = pos_filter(0, int)
<br/>    
<br/>    @no_request
<br/>    def id_to_object(*args, **kwargs):
<br/>        return (models.Object.objects.get(pk=args[0]),), kwargs
<br/>    
<br/>    detail_deco = APDecorator(
<br/>        id_to_int,
<br/>        id_to_object
<br/>    )The view:: </p>

<p>    from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
<br/>    
<br/>    @detail_deco
<br/>    def details(request, object):
<br/>        return render_to_response(&#39;object_details.html&#39;, {&#39;object&#39;: object})And there you have it: from URL to HTML in only a few lines of code, using APs. Whilst Django&#39;s generic object_detail view could also do this in just the URLconf, this is a striking example of how APs could save some of the boilerplate that would otherwise go into the view: turning the id into an integer, looking up the object, and then rendering. Also, this would have to be replicated for several different views: APs may be reused, and so are a more efficient (and DRY) way of factoring out some of the patterns in development.</p>

 title : The django-axes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-axes is a very simple way for you to keep track of failed login attempts, both for the Django admin and for the rest of your site.  The name is sort of a geeky pun, since axes can be read interpretted as: </p>

<p>&quot;access&quot;, as in monitoring access attempts &quot;axes&quot;, as in tools you can use hack (generally on wood).  In this case, however, the &quot;hacking&quot; part of it can be taken a bit further: django-axes is intended to help you stop people from hacking (popular media definition) your website.  Hilarious, right?  That&#39;s what I thought too! Requirementsdjango-axes requires Django 1.0 or later.  The application is intended to work around the Django admin and the regular django.contrib.auth login-powered pages. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-axes using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>easy_installYou can download the package from the CheeseShop or use </p>

<p>easy_install django-axesto download and install django-axes. </p>

<p>Package DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember.  Use python setup.py install to install it. </p>

<p>Checkout from MercurialExecute the following command (or use the equivalent function in a GUI such as TortoiseHg), and make sure you&#39;re checking django-axes out somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>hg clone http://django-axes.googlecode.com/hg django-axes
<br/>hg clone http://bitbucket.org/codekoala/django-axesCheckout from GitHubExecute the following command, and make sure you&#39;re checking django-axes out somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/codekoala/django-axes.gitVerifying InstallationThe easiest way to ensure that you have successfully installed django-axes is to execute a command such as: </p>

<p>python -c &quot;import axes; print axes.get_version()&quot;If that command completes with some sort of version number, you&#39;re probably good to go.  If you see error outout, you need to check your installation (I&#39;d start with your PYTHONPATH). </p>

<p>ConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;axes&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Next, install the FailedLoginMiddleware middleware: </p>

<p>MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
<br/>    &#39;django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;axes.middleware.FailedLoginMiddleware&#39;
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates the appropriate tables in your database that are necessary for operation. </p>

<p>Customizing AxesYou have a couple options available to you to customize django-axes a bit.  These should be defined in your settings.py file. </p>

<p>AXES_LOGIN_FAILURE_LIMIT: The number of login attempts allowed before a record is created for the failed logins.  Default: 3 AXES_LOCK_OUT_AT_FAILURE: After the number of allowed login attempts are exceeded, should we lock out this IP (and optional user agent)?  Default: True AXES_USE_USER_AGENT: If True, lock out / log based on an IP address AND a user agent.  This means requests from different user agents but from the same IP are treated differently.  Default: False UsageUsing django-axes is extremely simple.  Once you install the application and the middleware, all you need to do is periodically check the Access Attempts section of the admin.  A log file is also created for you to keep track of the events surrounding failed login attempts.  This log file can be found in your Django project directory, by the name of axes.log.  In the future I plan on offering a way to customize options for logging a bit more. </p>

<p>By default, django-axes will lock out repeated attempts from the same IP address.  You can allow this IP to attempt again by deleting the relevant AccessAttempt records in the admin.</p>

<p>Problem:  </p>

<p>I wanted an easy way to populate a site with content (and a navigation menu).  Also, I didn&#39;t want to force the old lady in the front office to use the admin interface. I wanted to be able to test other modules with actual site content, but hated re-plugging it in every time I killed the database. </p>

<p>My solution is this module (or at least this iteration of it). </p>

<p>Note: All editing features are only by users marked as &#39;staff&#39;. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>&quot;Edit me&quot;: Content is editable straight from the page on which it&#39;s displayed.  Works &amp; plays well with others: Content is accessed by URL.  If no content (or other app) is found by URL, a message is displayed in the page, &quot;No content for... exists. Click to create it&quot; Easy navigation menu: Top-level menu items managed by click. 2nd-level menu items pulled from content Easy template-tags: Menu and Content blocks also available as template-tags (Mucho easy!) Load content on syncdb: On initial &#39;syncdb&#39;, it checks to see if content exists.  If not, it&#39;ll ask if you want to load it from a file (included).  How sweet is that!? </p>

<p>Setup: </p>

<p>Download the module and copy the &#39;content&#39; folder into your project Add &#39;content&#39; to your &#39;settings.py&#39; file. Add this as the last entry in your &#39;urls.py&#39;: (r&#39;&#39;, include(&#39;content.urls&#39;)), 
<br/>Change the &#39;default.html&#39; in the Content templates to extend whichever of your templates you prefer. (I have mine extending &#39;base_2col.html&#39;) Put in any content you wish into the &#39;pre-populate-data.py&#39; file. </p>

<p>Note: In the &#39;management.py&#39; and &#39;pre-populate-data.py&#39; files, there are references to &#39;stockphoto&#39;.  I wanted to show how to use a photo app with this module. Feel free to change/omit as desired.</p>

 title : The django-crud-enhancement Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionIt is an enhancement of django-crudapi project at first, but by now it has become an independent app. </p>

<p>介绍一个 django 通用 crud 操作的实现，开始设计时参考了 django-crudapi </p>

<p>实现的特性: </p>

<p>通过简洁的 url 模式对所有的 django model 进行增删改查操作。如：  GET /api/app/model/ 返回列表   POST /api/app/model/?field1=value1&amp;field2=value2... 创建一条记录   GET /api/app/model/3 返回第三条数据的信息   POST /api/app/model/3/?_method=put&amp;field1=value1&amp;field2=value2... 修改第三条记录   POST /api/app/model/3/?_medhod=delete 删除第三条数据  对应的 url 设置如下： 
<br/> (r&#39;^(?Papi)/&#39;, include(&#39;apps.resource.urls&#39;)),  
<br/>url 中设置参数，现在支持三个固定参数：  _method: put or delete, 用于 POST 时代替 http 中的 PUT 和 DELETE 方法。   _format: json or xml or html, 用于控制生成格式，默认为 json。   _fields(0.96只支持xml格式，trunk 中都可用，django 序列化方法的 bug 已经修复): 限制一个 model class 中的返回 fields, 当作列表来处理，url 中可以这样 &amp;_format=xml&amp;_fields=name&amp;_fields=code&amp;...。  支持不固定的参数，可以在 GET 时添加搜索条件，如： 
<br/> GET /api/app/model/?name=some_name&amp;id__lt=3 会返回 name 为 some_name 且 id &lt; 3 的记录。  两种访问权限方式，api key 和 session (现有的代码暂时去掉了 api key 的方法，因为这样不用生成数据库表，如果想用的话可以参考models.py，同时将Resource.py中的get_user部分反注释即可) 支持多种返回格式，xml, json, html 片段，默认返回json格式，其中 html 片段使用 django 的 generic view，只需按命名规则创建模板即可。 可配置行为，可以通过继承 Resource 类来覆盖默认行为，比如我在 Resource 中添加的 before_update 钩子： </p>

<p>    def before_update(self, request, obj):
<br/>        # 同步设置当前修改时间和用户
<br/>        if hasattr(obj, &#39;update_time&#39;):
<br/>            obj.update_time = datetime.today()
<br/>        if hasattr(obj, &#39;update_user&#39;):
<br/>            obj.update_user = get_user(request)可以在 update 之前做一些额外的事情，将 update_user 设置为当前用户，将修改时间设置为当前时间等。类似的钩子还有 before_create, before_get_list 和 before_read。 
<br/>支持一个 model 对应多个 api，见下面的用法说明 用法resource 是一个django app，可以直接放入你的 app 目录下，并在 settings 中添加对应 INSTALLED_APPS 配置。最后在你的 urls.py 中 include resource 目录下的 urls.py 即可(推荐)，例如：urls.py： </p>

<p># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
<br/>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
<br/>from django.db import models
<br/>from apps.resource import register
<br/>from apps.resource.Resource import Resource</p>

<p># 可以通过继承来覆盖默认方法
<br/>class MyResource(Resource):
<br/>    cannot_see_fields = [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;passwd&#39;]</p>

<p># 这里注册了所有 model, 正式项目中应该有选择的进行注册
<br/>for model in models.get_models():
<br/>    register(&#39;api&#39;, model, Resource)
<br/>    # 支持一个 model 多个 api
<br/>    register(&#39;another_api&#39;, model, MyResource)</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    (r&#39;^$&#39;, &#39;django.views.generic.simple.direct_to_template&#39;,
<br/>            {&#39;template&#39;: &#39;index.html&#39;}),
<br/>    (r&#39;^admin/&#39;, include(&#39;django.contrib.admin.urls&#39;)),
<br/>    (r&#39;^(?Papi)/&#39;, include(&#39;apps.resource.urls&#39;)),
<br/>    (r&#39;^(?Panother_api)/&#39;, include(&#39;apps.resource.urls&#39;)),
<br/>)url中应该有个名为 key 参数。 </p>

<p>Primary repository: http://github.com/bartTC/django-frontendadmin/ </p>

<p>Quick installation instruction
<br/>==============================</p>

<p>1. Put ``frontendadmin`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in the settings.py of your
<br/>   django project.</p>

<p>2. Add ``django.core.context_processors.request`` to your ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``
<br/>   in the settings.py of your django project. If this is not available (default since
<br/>   some days) put this snippet into your settings::</p>

<p>    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
<br/>        &#39;django.core.context_processors.request&#39;,
<br/>        &#39;django.core.context_processors.auth&#39;,
<br/>        &#39;django.core.context_processors.debug&#39;,
<br/>        &#39;django.core.context_processors.i18n&#39;,
<br/>        &#39;django.core.context_processors.media&#39;,
<br/>    )</p>

<p>3. Include frontendadmin urls in your urlsconf::</p>

<p>    (r&#39;^frontendadmin/&#39;, include(&#39;frontendadmin.urls&#39;)),</p>

<p>4. Load the ``frontendadmin_tags`` library in every template you want to use
<br/>   the frontendamin links. (see below)::</p>

<p>    {% load frontendadmin_tags %}</p>

<p>5. There are three templatetags to either create, change or delete objects::</p>

<p>    {% frontendadmin_add queryset_of_objects %}
<br/>    {% frontendadmin_change object_to_change %}
<br/>    {% frontendadmin_delete object_to_delete %}</p>

<p>   Assumed that you have a weblog application and using generic-views, your
<br/>   template might look so::</p>

<p>    {% for entry in object_list %}
<br/>    
<br/>      {{ entry.title }}
<br/>      {{ entry.body }}
<br/>    
<br/>    {% endfor %}</p>

<p>   A proper implementation of frontendadmin would be::</p>

<p>    {% frontendadmin_add object_list %}
<br/>    {% for entry in object_list %}
<br/>    
<br/>      {{ entry.title }}
<br/>      {{ entry.body }}
<br/>      {% frontendadmin_change entry %}
<br/>      {% frontendadmin_delete entry %}
<br/>    
<br/>    {% endfor %}</p>

<p>6. Thats all. Frontendadmin will automatically check whether the current user has
<br/>   add/change/delete permissions for the given model.</p>

<p>   Frontendadmin has build-in ajax support using the jquery library. See the
<br/>   template-sources for details.</p>

 summary : <p>July 12, 2009: In the next few days I will be checking in a backwards-incompatible change that will convert django-locationtracking into a GeoDjango app. The benefits it will be bringing include things like location awareness (it can find which (defined) position you&#39;re nearest - i.e. if you create an &quot;Office&quot; item with a lat/lon it can show only a named position if you like/prefer.) and just being cool. Please use a svn rev. of 19 or before if you will not be using a spatial database and have a working GeoDjango environment set up. </p>

<p>This app is built for those who desire (and understand the privacy implications) to add location tracking to their tumblelogs/sites.  It is being extracted from a private site, and is capable of talking to instamapper.com (who have a decent iPhone app and Java apps for many other phones), APRS over amateur radio, the SPOT satellite tracking service, and (non-live) output files from hardware GPS loggers. </p>

 summary : <p>Django-MarkupsNotice: Project is in alpha stage! This currently doesn&#39;t include actual markdowns at all, only framework where adding markup functions is easy. I&#39;m just starting to include them. </p>

<p>Warning: I might refactor the code significantly at this point of development. </p>

<p>Allows easier way to do models that uses markup, using custom field called MarkupField. </p>

<p>This field is actually ForeignKey but using custom widgets and fields it provides more user friendly interface. Behind the scenes all markups are saved to Markup model, which contains markup, content, content_render fields behind the scenes. </p>

<p>UI allows users to choose the markup they wish to use, and write using it directly to textarea. I&#39;m planning to add the customizations using JS and CSS to the specific markup choices and textareas. </p>

<p>Usageclass MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>    description = MarkupField()
<br/>    ...More detailed use case can be seen in svn at trunk/examples/dmarkupsexample/ which contains django project. </p>

<p>DependenciesCurrently there are no actual dependencies, besides that this requires django to be in python path. Django must include the newforms merge, for instance I have tried with Django 1.0. </p>

<p>DevelopmentSVN trunk/ is the development root and same time Eclipse PyDev project called django-markups, and thus should be checked out named as django-markups. If you wish to use PyDev project, the files has dependency to project called django which is the Django itself. So you need to checkout django to your Eclipse workspace too, this in fact is very handy since it provides full auto completion of django libraries too.</p>

 summary : <p>MinLis, or Minute Listener, runs saved events at a scheduled time. It works as a background thread that wakes up every 60 seconds. It checks the database for any events scheduled to run, fires those events, and goes back to sleep. The events are django models saved to the database. They store the scheduled time to run and how often to repeat (if at all). So far there are two type of events, events that can run a method on a model (using generics) and events that run a string through python&#39;s eval(). This way, to schedule something to run, all you have to do is save an Event to the database. </p>

<p>Scheduling a background task is as easy as saving a model! </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently doing some more bug testing and polishing things, but when I&#39;m done I will put up the code for all to work on. </p>

 summary : <p>This application will allow users of Django-powered websites keep track of the time they spend on different projects.  It&#39;s a work in process. </p>

<p>FeaturesConfigurable: Pendulum can be configured to operate on several Django-powered sites.  The period lengths can be configured as monthly or as a fixed-length period. Projects: You can have an unlimited number of projects to be able to categorize hours spent working on certain tasks.  Each project can be activated/deactivated as necessary via the Django admin. Activities: Activities allow you to further categorize work done on particular tasks for each project. ScreenshotsIf you&#39;re interested in seeing some screenshots of Pendulum, head on over to PendulumScreenshots. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Requirementsdjango-pendulum requires a modern version of the Django framework.  By modern I simply mean a version with the newforms-admin functionality.  If you&#39;re running on Django 1.0 or later, you&#39;re good. </p>

<p>django-pendulum also relies upon the django.contrib.admin, django.contrib.auth, django.contrib.contenttypes, and django.contrib.sites frameworks. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-pendulum using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>easy_installYou can download the package from the CheeseShop or use  </p>

<p>easy_install django-pendulumto download and install django-pendulum. </p>

<p>Package DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember.  Use python setup.py install to install it. </p>

<p>Checkout from SubversionExecute the following command (or use the equivalent function in a GUI such as TortoiseSVN), and make sure you&#39;re checking Pendulum out somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>svn co http://django-pendulum.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pendulum pendulumVerifying InstallationThe easiest way to ensure that you have successfully installed Pendulum is to execute a command such as: </p>

<p>python -c &quot;import pendulum; pendulum.get_version()&quot;If that displays the version of Pendulum that you tried to install, you&#39;re good to roll.  If you see something other than that, you probably need to check your PYTHONPATH environment variable. </p>

<p>ConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;pendulum&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates a few tables in your database that are necessary for operation. </p>

<p>Next, you should add an entry to your main urls.py file.  For example: </p>

<p>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *</p>

<p>from django.contrib import admin
<br/>admin.autodiscover()</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    (r&#39;^admin/(.*)&#39;, admin.site.root),
<br/>    (r&#39;^pendulum/&#39;, include(&#39;pendulum.urls&#39;)),
<br/>)The next thing you will want to do is configure Pendulum for the active Django sites.  Do this by going into the Django admin and clicking the &quot;add&quot; link next to Pendulum Configurations. </p>

<p>The first step in the configuration is to choose which site this particular configuration will apply to.  The decision is easy if you only have one site :) </p>

<p>Next, you must choose what kind of &quot;accounting period&quot; you wish to use.  If you want month-long periods, ensure the &quot;Is monthly&quot; check box is selected.  Then enter the day of the month that the periods begin.  Periods that begin on the first of the month will always range from midnight on the first of each month to 11:59:59 PM on the last day of each month.  Periods that begin on the 16th of the month will range from midnight on the 16th of each month to 11:59:59 PM on the 15th of the following month.  Be wise about choosing start days such as the 31st of the month--it&#39;s not a wise choice no matter what situation you&#39;re in. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you may choose fixed-length accounting periods.  The installation date does not necessarily have to be the actual installation date.  This field is used as a reference point for creating periods.  For example, if you have 2-week long accounting periods that begin on Sundays and end two Saturdays later, you would select any Sunday from any month from any year.  Then you would enter 14 for the period length.  Periods will automatically be constructed that will begin at midnight each Sunday and end at 11:59:59 PM two Saturdays in the future. </p>

<p>If you fail to configure Pendulum for a given site, you will likely receive HTTP 500 errors if you try to access Pendulum via the front-end. </p>

<p>Add ProjectsNext, you should add at least one project to Pendulum.  This can easily be accomplished via the Django admin.  The same goes for activities, but these are not required. </p>

<p>PermissionsFinally, be sure set people up with the appropriate permissions using Django&#39;s Auth framework.  The front end side of Pendulum respects these permissions.  That means that if a user doesn&#39;t have the permission to clock in, the will be presented with a login screen (even if they&#39;re logged in already) when they try to clock in on the front end site.  The same goes for other operations such as pausing/unpausing entries, updating entries, deleting entries, etc. </p>

<p>An easy way to assign the same Pendulum permissions to several users is to create a Group using the Auth framework.  There is a custom command for creating a group with all of the permissions necessary for the front end, including the ability to: </p>

<p>add entries update entries delete entries clock in clock out pause/unpause entries To use this command, simply run ./manage.py create_pendulum_group.  You may run ./manage.py help create_pendulum_group to learn about options for this command. </p>

<p>The Date FieldI&#39;ve been hesitant to do anything to make the date/time fields more user-friendly when adding or updating entries.  I don&#39;t want to tie anyone down to my particular way of doing things.  I personally prefer jQuery for this sort of thing, but I do realize that jQuery disgusts many other people out there.  Therefore, the first versions of the application didn&#39;t come with anything to make those fields easier to use and understand. </p>

<p>However, that seems to be the most common complaint amongst those who have played with the application--the lack of user-friendly date pickers.  As such, I have added some jQuery-based utilities to make choosing a date easier and more intuitive. </p>

<p>By default, the application will expect to find the appropriate files in a directory called pendulum within your media directory.  All you should need to do is copy or symlink the media folder from the Pendulum application directory.  If you copy the media folder, rename it to pendulum.  If you create a symlink to Pendulum&#39;s media folder, make sure the symlink is called pendulum.  This directory should hold all of the necessary files to make the date picker work. </p>

<p>In your add_update_entry.html template (if you override the default ones), make sure you have a code block such as: </p>

<p>{% block extra-head %}
<br/>{{ form.media }}</p>

<p>$(document).ready(function () {
<br/>    $(&#39;input.vDateField&#39;).datepicker({
<br/>            dateFormat: $.datepicker.W3C,
<br/>            showOn: &#39;both&#39;,
<br/>            buttonImage: &#39;{{ MEDIA_URL }}pendulum/img/calendar.png&#39;,
<br/>            buttonImageOnly: true
<br/>        });
<br/>});</p>

<p>{% endblock %}This is just jQuery&#39;s way of attaching the date picker to the appropriate fields. </p>

<p>Customizing The Date PickerI tried to put some utilities in the application to allow you to change the date picker that is used with ease.  There is a variable that you can define in your settings.py file to override the default date picker: PENDULUM_DATE_MEDIA.  If you simply want to change the styling CSS,, for example, you could use this variable.  The default value is: </p>

<p>PENDULUM_DATE_MEDIA = {
<br/>    &#39;js&#39;: (settings.MEDIA_URL + &#39;pendulum/js/jquery.js&#39;,
<br/>            settings.MEDIA_URL + &#39;pendulum/js/jquery.ui.js&#39;),
<br/>    &#39;css&#39;: {
<br/>        &#39;all&#39;: (settings.MEDIA_URL + &#39;pendulum/css/jquery-ui.css&#39;,)
<br/>    }
<br/>}You can see that it is a dictionary with two keys: js and css.  The values of these two items conform to the concepts outlined in Django&#39;s documentation.  Changing the values within PENDULUM_DATE_MEDIA should permit you to completely remove or replace the date picker as you desire.</p>

The working copy of the combination can be found on the project&#39;s Bitbucket page.  The django-picasso project will likely be deleted from Google Code in the near future. </p>

<p>IntroductionI love Google&#39;s Picasa desktop application, and the ability to upload photos to the Picasa Web Albums site using the app is extremely useful.  When I built my personal website using Django, I wanted a way to use Picasa Web Albums as a backend for my photos section so that I could take advantage of the easy uploads.  I couldn&#39;t find a Django pluggable app that fit what I was looking for, so I decided to go ahead and make one using the Picasa Web Albums API and the GData Python client. </p>

<p>AboutDjango-Picasso is a relatively simply way to synchronize data from the Picasa Web Albums API into your local database and use it in your web application.  It does this using a script that integrates the GData Python client and a set of Django models.  This script can be called from the custom management command that I built and run from a cron job, or for more flexibility it can be imported and run directly from picasso.utils.  The script does not import the actual picture files - it saves links to the pictures hosted on the Picasa Web Albums site. </p>

<p>If you find this project useful and modify it to add features, please consider sharing those enhancements by adding a patch to an issue ticket.  I&#39;ll review and apply the enhancement to the trunk so that it can be shared with the community.  Thanks! </p>

<p>PrerequisitesDjango-Picasso requires the GData Python Client, which can be downloaded here. </p>

<p>Debian/Ubuntu users: I tried to install the python-gdata package from apt-get, but it did not provide the same functionality.  I wasn&#39;t able to import gdata.photos.service.PhotoService(), which is what I use in the utility script.  I had to install the python client using the link above and the included setup.py script. </p>

 title : The django-podcast Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-podcast is a Django application that allows you to easily publish podcasts that conform to the RSS 2.0 and iTunes RSS podcast specifications. </p>

<p>Update 2009/03/05: This project has, like all of the cool Django apps, moved to GitHub. The code here will be available for archival purposes, but for the latest, get on over to GitHub, fork, contribute, and all that good stuff. </p>

<p>Django and Python versiondjango-podcast requires at least Django 0.97 revision 7967. This revision incorporated the newforms-admin branch into trunk and makes the most notable use of it in the categories class of the application&#39;s models. However, I heavily encourage you to develop with the Django development version (known as &quot;trunk&quot;), which is Django 1.0.x at the time of this writing. At the least, please use Django 1.0. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re developing on a web host, Python is probably already installed. To check, type python from the command line after logging in via SSH. If Python isn&#39;t installed, download and install Python. At least Python version 2.3 is recommended. </p>

<p>ssh user@domain.com 
<br/>     </p>

<p>python </p>

<p>InstallationAfter connecting to your server via SSH, typically you download Django and other packages into a source directory. You would then symlink the django directory to a location that resides on your Python path. Likewise, download django-podcast from the Google Code Subversion repository and symlink the podcast directory. </p>

<p>If you work with WebFaction (like I do), and assuming one location on your Python path is $HOME/webapps/django/lib/python2.5, it might go like: </p>

<p>mkdir ~/source 
<br/>svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ $HOME/source/django-trunk/ 
<br/>ln -s $HOME/source/django-trunk/django/ $HOME/webapps/django/lib/python2.5/django 
<br/>svn co http://django-podcast.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $HOME/source/django-podcast-read-only/ 
<br/>ln -s $HOME/source/django-podcast-read-only/podcast/ $HOME/webapps/django/lib/python2.5/podcast 
<br/>Add podcast as a tuple item to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>    INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>      ...
<br/>      &#39;podcast&#39;,
<br/>      ...
<br/>    )Add these lines to your URL configuration, urls.py: </p>

<p>    urlpatterns += patterns(&#39;&#39;, 
<br/>        (r&#39;^podcasts/&#39;, include(&#39;podcast.urls&#39;)),
<br/>    )Run the syncdb command from the directory in which your settings.py resides, most probably your applications&#39; project directory. Again, if you&#39;re on WebFaction like I am, where example-project is your project name: </p>

<p>cd ~/webapps/django/example-project/ 
<br/>     </p>

<p>python manage.py syncdb </p>

<p>Alternatively if the Django binary directory is on your Python path, run the syncdb command from any directory to install the database tables. </p>

<p>django-admin.py syncdb 
<br/>If you installed the Django admin application, you should be able to see the podcast application&#39;s show and episode areas: </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/admin/podcast/ 
<br/>You might need to restart the server for changes to take effect, especially if you are running Django on mod_python. </p>

<p>DependenciesNone. However, consider a thumbnail creation utility, such as sorl-thumbnail, if you are not in control of creating your podcast show artwork. iTunes suggests show artwork should be a width and height of 600 pixels, but you might want to reduce the size of artwork on your website. </p>

<p>Web site URLsThe default, out-of-the-box Web site URLs should look something like: </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/podcasts/ 
<br/>     </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/ 
<br/>     http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/title-of-episode/ </p>

<p>The /podcasts/ portion of the URL is hard coded into the URL configuration. Beautifully designed default templates are included, so feel free to show off your URLs after saving a show and an episode! Note that the templates were not stress tested in Internet Explorer 6 or 7, but work on Web standards browsers. </p>

<p>FeedBurner and iTunes URLsAfter saving at least one show and one episode, consider submitting your feed URL to FeedBurner for keeping track of podcast subscriber statistics. Your feed URL should be something like, where title-of-show is the slug of your show: </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/feed/ 
<br/>Remember to check the checkbox for &quot;I&#39;m a podcaster!&quot; Your new FeedBurner URL should be something like: </p>

<p>http://feeds.feedburner.com/TitleOfShow 
<br/>You can now return to your website&#39;s admin and paste this URL into your Show&#39;s FeedBurner textbox. For bonus points, submit your FeedBurner URL to the iTunes Store. Your iTunes podcast URL should then be something like: </p>

<p>http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=000000000 
<br/>The advantage of submitting your FeedBurner URL to the iTunes Store allows you to track show statistics while also giving users the advantage of using the friendly iTunes interface. Return to the admin again and paste the iTunes show URL into the Show&#39;s iTunes URL textbox. Promote either the FeedBurner URL or the iTunes URL using each respective template tag on your website (in the simplest example): </p>

<p>{{ show.feedburner }} 
<br/>     </p>

<p>{{ show.itunes }} </p>

<p>Ping iTunes for new contentThe iTunes Store checks new content daily but you might want to make a new episode available immediately in the iTunes Store. Visit your show&#39;s ping URL to make that episode available, which would be something like: </p>

<p>https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/pingPodcast?id=000000000 
<br/>Alternatively, if you&#39;re a savvy developer, you could set up a cron job to handle this, but note that pinging too often could result in a removal from the iTunes Store. </p>

<p>Yahoo! Media RSS feed submissionLikewise, considering submitting your podcast to Yahoo! Search, which specifically accepts any kind of regularly published media-based (audio, video, image, document, etc.) RSS 2.0 feed or Media RSS feed. </p>

<p>Your Media RSS feed should be something like: </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/media/ 
<br/>Google video sitemapsIf you&#39;re creating a video podcast, you can submit a video sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools. The video sitemap will help Google index videos in Google Video. </p>

<p>After a successful installation, the video sitemap URL should be something like: </p>

<p>http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/sitemap.xml 
<br/>Additionally, you can add the video sitemap URL to your robots.txt file. </p>

<p>Sitemap: http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/sitemap.xml 
<br/>Google allows the submission of a media RSS feed instead of the sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools if you prefer. </p>

 title : The django-poormanscron Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Django Poor Man&#39;s Cron is Django app which makes use of spambots, search engine indexing robots and alike to run scheduled tasks in approximately regular intervals. </p>

<p>This app isn&#39;t meant to be a fully-featured project, but rather a modifiable experimental concept. </p>

<p>To install the app, do the following: </p>

<p>Check it out and put it somewhere under python path. Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS and its PoorMansCronMiddleware class to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in your project settings. Run python manage.py syncdb to update the DB schema. Create management commands for scheduled tasks (probably you can also use Django Command Extensions). Create ScheduledTask objects in Django administration. </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (

<p>The source code is available on GitHub.</p>
 summary : <p>Personalized URLs (PURLs) have been an upcoming marketing tactic for a few years now. This technology combines the use of variable printing on direct mail pieces which incorporates a PURL. Recipients of the piece then visit their very own personalized website. </p>

<p>There are many projects out there that use PURLs and they are all rather expensive. This project hopes to make it easier for Django developers to make their own PURLs.</p>

 summary : <p>A Django country and regions application. Contains views to dynamically grab region listings for countries and javascript helper functions.</p>
 title : The django-reploc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-reploc is a project that allows you to install a Google Map on your site to display and filter &quot;representatives&quot; for your site. These representatives may be dealers/vendors for your products, your friends or business associates, or just places you&#39;ve been and want to advertise. I built the application to be a dealer locator, but I realize the value in an application like this and tried to make it as generic as possible. </p>

<p>FeaturesUnlimited number of representatives. Unlimited number of locations per representative. Automatic latitude/longitude determination for locations.  If there&#39;s a problem determining the coordinates to the address, you can enter them manually. Locations can have &quot;attributes.&quot;  This is a way of specifying, for example, which locations carry which lines of your products. You can decide whether you want to use JavaScript or Python to do the heavy lifting. Users can search for locations within a radius of an address they specify. Offer your users driving directions to various representative locations. Requirementsdjango-reploc requires at least Django 1.0.  For automatic coordinate determination, django-reploc requires the geopy library.  This can be installed using easy_install geopy.  The application also requires that you have a Google Maps API key.  To get one of those, simply go to the Google Maps API page and fill out the necessary information.  Finally, django-reploc relies heavily upon jQuery in order to operate.  I used the latest version of jQuery, which is currently 1.2.6. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-reploc using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>easy_installYou can download the package from the CheeseShop or use </p>

<p>easy_install django-replocto download and install django-reploc. </p>

<p>Package DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember.  Use python setup.py install to install it. </p>

<p>Checkout from SubversionExecute the following command (or use the equivalent function in a GUI such as TortoiseSVN), and make sure you&#39;re checking Pendulum out somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>svn co http://django-reploc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/reploc replocVerifying InstallationThe easiest way to ensure that you have successfully installed Pendulum is to execute a command such as: </p>

<p>python -c &quot;import reploc; print reploc.get_version()&quot;If that displays the version of django-reploc that you tried to install, you&#39;re good to roll.  If you see something other than that, you probably need to check your PYTHONPATH environment variable. </p>

<p>ConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;reploc&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Next you should add the context processor to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting so the templates have access to the Google Maps API key.  You don&#39;t really need this step if you&#39;re going to put the API key straight into your template. </p>

<p>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.core.context_processors.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.core.context_processors.i18n&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.core.context_processors.media&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;reploc.context_processors.representatives&#39;,
<br/>)Define your Google Maps API key in your settings.py file </p>

<p>GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY = &#39;sdfsafasfdasfdasdf&#39;Additionally, you may specify whether you would like the grunt work (distance calculations and whatnot) handled by JavaScript or Python: </p>

<p>REPLOC_USE_JS = FalseThis will probably never be used much, but it&#39;s there just in case.  The application defaults to using JavaScript. </p>

<p>Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates a few tables in your database that are necessary for operation. </p>

<p>Next, you should add an entry to your main urls.py file.  For example: </p>

<p>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *</p>

<p>from django.contrib import admin
<br/>admin.autodiscover()</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    (r&#39;^admin/(.*)&#39;, admin.site.root),
<br/>    (r&#39;^locator/&#39;, include(&#39;reploc.urls&#39;)),
<br/>)Finally, you&#39;ll probably want to copy the media files that I use in django-reploc, unless you have some of your own.  Those files can be found in the /media/ directory of the project.  There are really only two files that you should need to copy to your media directory: reploc/media/js/jquery-1.3.1.min.js and reploc/media/img/ajax.gif (see http://code.google.com/p/django-reploc/source/browse/#svn/trunk/reploc/media for the specific files).  Alternatively, you may just override the templates to use whatever you want.  I make no guarantees that the application will still work if you do that though ;) </p>

<p>UsageAs soon as you have all of the configuration taken care of, simply fire up your site (or restart it) and jump into the Django administration interface.  You can add locations straight from the &quot;Add Representative&quot; page if you&#39;d like.  When you&#39;re done, head on over to http://www.yourwebsite.com/locator/ (or whatever it happens to be in your case) to see the application in action. </p>

<p>Updating Location CoordinatesI&#39;ve created a utility to help you update the location coordinates if you feel the need.  They should be updated each time you save a location, but if you want to update all of the locations in one swing, you can use the command ./manage.py reploc_update_coords.</p>
 title : The django-richtext Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-richtextRich Text Editors can be painful to install and configure, even with the powerful Django Framework.  </p>

<p>django-richtext lets you easily have a rich text editor for any of your django model fields or form fields. It&#39;s basically a set of custom form fields that make it a piece of cake to have rich text, anywhere, in django. </p>

<p>How it&#39;s usedExample Django Model: </p>

<p>class Blog(models.Model):
<br/>    content = AdminRichTextField()Example Django Form: </p>

<p>class ContactForm(forms.Form):
<br/>    message = RichTextField()Photologue users:django-richtext also optionally integrates with the popular photo management solution photologue. So if you use photologue then you&#39;ll like this even more. When you click to insert an image, a window pops up asking you to choose a Photo Size and a Photo. You make your selection and it automatically sticks the correct sized photo into your text editor.</p>
 title : The django-roulade Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Roulade allows you to create &quot;tumblelogs&quot; that can aggregate any of your models into one simple list. It was written when I wanted to use jellyroll, but didn&#39;t like the idea of defining models for storing roll items, much less the concept of providers - which, for my purposes, was stepping on the toes of the apps that are already in my project anyway. I also wasn&#39;t especially thrilled about changing my models to have specific fields just to be jellyroll compatible either. Roulade requires no models of its own, and is flexible enough to follow a non-model based data source if you&#39;re into the &quot;provider&quot; thing anyway. However, borrowing a phrase from the jellyroll wiki, &quot;It&#39;s also extremely not done yet.&quot;</p>
 summary : <p>django-rstify - A restructured text filter for django templatesdjango-rstify is a set of template filters to provide easy conversion from restructured text to HTML. Besides this basic functionality this application allows you to highlight sourcecode snippets inside your text using the pygments library. </p>

<p>Note: Django already provides a simple restructured text filter. If you don&#39;t need the extras in this application, I recommend to use the core version. </p>

<p>DownloadThe main repository of this app is located on Github. You can easily checkout the latest version using git: </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/bartTC/django-rstify.git  or download this app as a .tar.gz file. See Links on the right side for download links. </p>

<p>How to use it in templatesTo convert a restructured text from an object to HTML simply apply the rstify filter on it: </p>

<p>{% load rstify_tags %}</p>

<p>{{ entry.content|rstify }}If you want to convert inline content, use the filter templatetag around: </p>

<p>{% load rstify_tags %}</p>

<p>{% filter rstify %}
<br/>This is some *restructured text*.
<br/>{% endfilter %}How to use it in sourcecodeApplying this filter inside your code is easy: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from rstify import rstify
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print rstify(&#39;This is *restructured text*.&#39;)
<br/>This is restructured text.</p>

<p>Initial Header LevelBy default the initial heading in your restructured text becomes a </p>

<p> in HTML: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; header = &#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>... ================
<br/>... This is a Header
<br/>... ================
<br/>... &#39;&#39;&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print rstify(header)</p>

<p>This is a Header
<br/>You can override this by setting the initial_header_level to an integer from 1 to 6: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; print rstify(header, initial_header_level=3)</p>

<p>This is a Header
<br/>In your template just set this as the first option of the rstify filter: </p>

<p>{{ entry.content|rstify:&quot;3&quot; }}Syntax Highlightingdjango-rstify provides syntax highlighting using the pygments library. To highlight parts of your restructured text, simply put it in a sourcecode directive: </p>

<p>Here is some text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
<br/>Integer porttitor nulla sed dui. Aenean lorem mi, tincidunt et, porttitor
<br/>nec, condimentum venenatis, felis. Maecenas ornare blandit leo.</p>

<p>.. sourcecode:: python</p>

<p>    def foo(bar):
<br/>        return bar*2</p>

<p>Continue with text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
<br/>Integer porttitor nulla sed dui. Aenean lorem mi, tincidunt et, porttitor nec,
<br/>condimentum venenatis, felis. Maecenas ornare blandit leo.Pygments provides a bunch of highlighters (also called lexer), just replace python with a lexer of your choice. Here is a complete set of available lexers. Read pygments styles how to colorize the output using css.</p>

<p>This project will create simple (mean easy to use and not disturbing) but effective Scrum management tool for distributed Scrum teams made using Django (with newforms-admin) and Ajax with jQuery. It will have: </p>

<p>multiple projects and teams stories for project with file attachments sprints with tasks and their descriptions burndown chart stories and tasks with history of changes per project impediments tags for stories There will be admin interface for all this (basic version already done) but the standard Django admin is not the best way to do fast and simple Scrum management, so there will be a dashboard for stories and tasks management powered by Ajax to simplify day by day work with the tool. Creation of sprints, projects, impediments and user management will stay on admin level, because it is not done every day! </p>

 summary : <p>A couple of days ago, we discussed ideas of realizing a completely pluggable search app, which requires no modification of the existing apps, models and DB. This is in fact a question for Wheel 2.0, but in times of Mythbusters and DIY, reinventing the wheel seems to be fun, and sometimes required for understanding the basic mechanics of a matter. </p>

<p>For further information, read on in the wiki starting here: http://code.google.com/p/django-search-app/wiki/WikiHome </p>

<p>We&#39;re totally looking forward to any comments, thoughts, contributions, suggestions and links (especially like: “This is done already! Look here: …”).  </p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>

<p>We created a first Prototype, that full-fills most of our wishes.  </p>

<p>It is totally pluggable Works without any modification of existing code provides mechanisms to define ranking-rules based on models transform any third-party model to be useful in your search view without touching them define appearance of the results per model We won&#39;t publish this version, as is it just meant to evaluate our ideas.

 title : The django-session-messages Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project was intended to fill the gap until Django had anonymous session-based transient messages. With the release of 1.2 it will, therefore this project becomes deprecated. </p>

<p>The code here borrows quite a bit from the patch on Django ticket 4604, but is somewhat lighter because it doesn&#39;t attempt to transparently integrate Django&#39;s current user-based message system with anonymous messages.  The session-based messages are handled separately. </p>

 title : The django-simple-comments Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Why another comment app?Quite simply, I find django.contrib.comments bloated, clunky and lacking some major features.  One feature of django-simple-comments that&#39;s inspired by django.contrib.comments is the ability to attach a comment to absolutely any object of any type, thanks to the fantastic Content Types Framework.  Most everything else has been coded from the ground up. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I think django.contrib.comments is missing key features like Akismet and email notifications.  I realize comment_utils will do this, but I don&#39;t particularly like the idea of having to depend on another app just to get full functionality of the first app.  I&#39;d rather have a simple comments app that does what I need all by itself. </p>

<p>Update: New django.contrib.commentsA new version of django.contrib.comments has been merged into Django trunk.  It&#39;s significantly better than the old version, and there are a number of similarities between the new version and django-simple-comments.  However, I plan to continue development of django-simple-comments for a few reasons: </p>

<p>django.contrib.comments doesn&#39;t have built-in supprt for Akismet.  I realize it&#39;s possible to do this with Signals, but I want Akismet to be built-in to the app itself so that anytime I need to use it I simply add the API key to settings.py instead of having a separate signals.py to include with every project. I like having Approved / Moderate / Spam statues as opposed to &#39;is_public&#39; and &#39;is_removed&#39; boolean flags. This app has more robust feed generation (something I&#39;m planning to contribute back to contrib.comments) This will have built in support for &quot;Remember my info&quot; and &quot;Email me follow up comments&quot; checkboxes. I realize it&#39;s possible to extend contrib.comments to have these abilities, but again I want one app that does all this.  I don&#39;t want to manage multiple apps or files just to have fully functioning comments. </p>

<p>Current featuresFlag comments as approved, moderated or spam. Automatic feeds for all comments, comments for a specific content type, and comments for a specific object, like so: /feeds/comments/ =&gt; Feed of all latest comments /feeds/comments/blog.Post/ =&gt; Feed for latest comments on all blog Posts /feeds/comments/blog.Post/1/ =&gt; Feed for all comments on blog Post with ID = 1 &quot;Remember me&quot; ability to pre-populate form based on User info or sessions (for anonymous users) Automatic spam detection with Akismet Future featuresMost of these already exist in other projects I&#39;ve done and are in the process of being ported into this app. </p>

<p>&quot;Email me follow-up comments&quot; ability Email object author when comments are placed on an object. Addition of options (auto-approve, blacklist, spamlist), possibly using dbsettings Basic useNote: django-simple-comments is being developed with future compatibility in mind, so you&#39;ll need a recent 1.0 Beta version of Django. </p>

<p>Add &quot;comments&quot;, to INSTALLED_APPS Add `&quot;comments.context_processors.user_info&#39;,&quot; to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS Add (r&#39;^comments/&#39;, include(&#39;comments.urls&#39;)), to your URLCONF Add {% comment_form  %} into a template to display the comment form. That&#39;s it!  Examples of other features will be added in the near future. </p>

 title : The django-smileys Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-smileys is an application that allows your Django-powered site to display those annoying and useless smileys whenever the smileys filter a pattern that you specify.  This application serves a very simple purpose, but its uses can go beyond that of merely inserting smileys whenever a particular pattern (like &quot;:)&quot; or &quot;;)&quot;).  It can replace whatever pattern you want with an image of your choosing.  There&#39;s gotta be something useful in that, right? </p>

<p>This application can make your blog, forums, photo galleries, user comments, etc a little more interesting, and it&#39;s very simple to install.  Free icon sets plague the Internet, and you can choose whatever icons you&#39;d like to use! </p>

<p>FeaturesStrict pattern matching: you can specify very strict patterns for your smileys Regular expression pattern matching: if you need a little more power in your pattern matching capabilities, you can specify that your patterns are regular expressions (on a per-smiley basis) and the filter should know what to do. RequirementsThis application was built on Django 1.0.2, and it should work with any version of Django that uses the admin.site.register method for telling the Django admin that a model should appear in the admin (as opposed to the class Admin: method). </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-smileys using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>Checkout from Subversionsvn co http://django-smileys.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/smileys smileysPackage DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember. </p>

<p>ConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;smileys&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates a the table in your database that is necessary for operation. </p>

<p>UsageOpen the template file that you want to have your smileys appear in and make sure it has something like this in it: </p>

<p>{% load smiley_tags %}</p>

<p>{% block content %}
<br/>{{ some_content_var|smileys }}
<br/>{% endblock %}The smiley_tags library provides you with a smileys filter, which will examine your database for all active smileys.  It then runs though some_content_var (in this example) and replaces the patterns it finds with the respective smileys.  Pretty simple huh! </p>

 title : The django-sprites Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CSS sprite maps are a Good Thing(tm). The advantages of using a CSS sprite map versus image slicing are well defined by Yahoo&#39;s Exceptional Performance team.  </p>

<p>The problem? CSS sprites maps are very brittle. Creating and maintaining the CSS and images by hand is tedious and error prone. </p>

<p>Django Sprites changes that. Django Sprites hooks into django&#39;s template engine to give designers an easy way of managing sprite maps inside of existing stylesheets. Django Sprites also uses the Python Imaging Library to generate the actual sprite image map itself. By generating both the stylesheet and the image map, updating the sprite map is quick and easy. </p>

<p>We aim to have our first release sometime in Summer 2009 </p>

<p>Note: The project is not dead. Please see this issue for a discussion of development in the short term.</p>
 title : The django-stateful Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?A revolutionary approach to web applications using django. Code your views using linear flow logic, maintaining the state across requests. Similar to UnCommon web, Seaside and Borges </p>

<p>Since its just another django app, you can still write some views in the traditional style, and use all the features of django web framework. </p>

<p>the other home of this project is http://woobiz.com.ar/en/articles/stateful-django </p>

<p>The kind of code you end up writing:A counter: </p>

<p>class Counter(StatefulView):
<br/>    def main(self):
<br/>        for c in count():
<br/>            yield Page(&quot;you&#39;ve been here %s times before&quot; % c)A wizard (kind of): </p>

<p>class NameForm(forms.Form):
<br/>    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
<br/>    
<br/>class LanguageForm(forms.Form):
<br/>    langs = [(x,x) for x in [&#39;python&#39;,&#39;perl&#39;,&#39;ruby&#39;,&#39;php&#39;,&#39;prolog&#39;]]
<br/>    lang = forms.ChoiceField(choices=langs, initial=&#39;python&#39;, widget=forms.RadioSelect)
<br/>    
<br/>class Wizard(StatefulView):
<br/>    def main(self):
<br/>        started = datetime.now()
<br/>        
<br/>        form = NameForm()
<br/>        name = None
<br/>        while not name:
<br/>            input, a, kw = yield show_page(&#39;ask_name.html&#39;, {&#39;form&#39;: form,})
<br/>            form = NameForm(input.GET)
<br/>            if form.is_valid():
<br/>                name = form.cleaned_data[&#39;name&#39;]
<br/>                
<br/>        form = LanguageForm()
<br/>        input, a, kw = yield show_page(&#39;ask_language.html&#39;, {&#39;form&#39;: form, &#39;name&#39;:name})
<br/>        form = LanguageForm(input.GET)
<br/>        
<br/>        if form.is_valid():
<br/>            lang = form.cleaned_data[&#39;lang&#39;]
<br/>            if lang == &#39;python&#39;:
<br/>                yield Page(&quot;Cool, now refresh and see how much time you spent in this wizard&quot;)
<br/>            else:
<br/>                yield FinalPage(&quot;well %s, i guess you should look for a %s framework then...&quot; % (name,lang))
<br/>        else:
<br/>            yield FinalPage(&quot;hey, you are not going with the flow you know, goodbye %s.&quot; % name)
<br/>        
<br/>        delta = datetime.now() - started
<br/>        yield FinalPage(&quot;You spent %s seconds, bye %s !!&quot; % (delta.seconds, name))
<br/>Implementation facts:Stores generators in memory to achieve statefulness. Uses request.session.session_key to tell visitors apart. A different thread takes care of cleaning up &#39;old&#39; generators. Requires the server to run in a single process. (a better implementation could use a separate storage for &#39;living&#39; generators, or serializable tasklets like twisted&#39;s) Mostly experimental, yet small intranet applications could use it right away. Installation, requirements and usageQuick and dirtyJust checkout trunk, edit reelevant paths in settings.py and run: </p>

<p>python manage.py runserver :then play around with example_app/views.py </p>

<p>Long versionCheckout django_stateful Add the following to your settings.py (or use the one from the repository): SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = True #this forces session_keys even for anonymous users CLEAN_STATES_SECONDS = 60 #this checks every 60 seconds if any stored state is over 60 seconds old, thus the oldest a state can be is around 60*2 seconds import the following things:  from django_stateful.views import StatefulView, Page, FinalPage, show_page  
<br/>Define a class that would be your view, inheriting from StatefulView and redefine its &#39;main&#39; method Inside the &#39;main&#39; method: If you want to show a page to the user, you can yield a Page (which is no more than a clean subclass of HttpResponse), like this:  yield Page(&quot;here&#39;s something the server wants to say&quot;)  
<br/>If you want to render a template to the user, use &#39;show page&#39;, its just an alias for render_to_response, like this:  yield show_page(&#39;template.html&#39;, {&#39;foo&#39;: foo, &#39;bar&#39;:bar})  
<br/>Apart from yielding an HttpResponse, every yield statement recieves the request, args and kwargs from the url dispatching mechanism, so in cases where you want to use those (for instance, when showing a form and waiting for the user to submit it), you can use the following idiom:  input, args, kwargs = yield show_page(&#39;ask_for_input.html&#39;, {&#39;form&#39;: form})  
<br/>When you&#39;re done with coding your view, you import it from your urls.py file then set your class &#39;handle&#39; classmethod as the target for the dispatching mechanism, like this: from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
<br/>from my_project.views import MyCustomView</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    url(r&#39;^my_custom_view/$&#39;, MyCustomView.handle),

 title : The django-watermark Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project provides a simple way for you to apply custom watermarks to images on your Django-powered website. </p>

<p>FeaturesOpacity: the filter allows you to specify the transparency level for your watermark image Watermark positioning: you have several options for positioning watermarks on your images Absolute: you can specify exact pixel locations for your watermark Relative: you can use percentages to place your watermark Corners: you can position your watermark in the corners of your images Random: you can tell the filter to randomly generate a position for your watermark Center: you can place watermarks in the center of the target image Scaling: the watermark can be scaled to cover your images or specify a scaling factor to use Tiling: the watermark can be tiled across your images Greyscale: you can convert the watermark to be greyscale before having it applied to the target image. Rotation: you can rotate your watermark a certain number of degrees or have the rotation be random. CreditsI snagged the original watermarking code from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/362879/ and turned it into a Django pluggable application.  Props to Shane Hathaway. </p>

<p>Requirementsdjango-watermark requires a modern version of the Django framework.  By modern I simply mean a version with the newforms-admin functionality.  If you&#39;re running on Django 1.0 or later, you&#39;re good. </p>

<p>django-watermark also relies upon the built-in django.contrib.admin and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).  I built it using PIL 1.1.6, but it may work with previous versions. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-watermark using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>easy_installYou can download the package from the CheeseShop or use </p>

<p>easy_install django-watermarkto download and install django-watermark. </p>

<p>Package DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .zip file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember.  Use python setup.py install to install it. </p>

<p>Checkout from SubversionExecute the following command (or use the equivalent function in a GUI such as TortoiseSVN), and make sure you&#39;re checking Pendulum out somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>svn co http://django-watermark.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/watermarker watermarkerVerifying InstallationThe easiest way to ensure that you have successfully installed Pendulum is to execute a command such as: </p>

<p>python -c &quot;import watermarker; print watermarker.get_version()&quot;If that displays the version of django-watermark that you tried to install, you&#39;re good to roll.  If you see something other than that, you probably need to check your PYTHONPATH environment variable. </p>

<p>ConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;watermarker&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates the tables in your database that are necessary for operation. </p>

<p>While we&#39;re in this section, I might as well mention a settings variable that you can override: WATERMARKING_QUALITY.  This should be an integer between 0 and 100.  The default is 85. </p>

<p>UsageAs mentioned above, you have several options when using django-watermark.  The first thing you must do is load the filter for the template in which you wish to apply watermarks to your images. </p>

<p>{% load watermark %}From the Django admin, go ahead and populate your database with some watermarks that you want to apply to your regular images.  Simply specify a name for the watermark and upload the watermark image itself.  It&#39;s probably not a good idea to put commas in your watermark names.  Watermarks should be transparent PNG files for best results.  I can&#39;t make any guarantees that other formats will work nicely. </p>

<p>The first parameter to the watermark filter must be the name you specified for the watermark in the Django admin.  You can then choose from a few other parameters to customize the application of the watermark.  Here they are: </p>

<p>positionThis one is quite customizable.  First, you can plug your watermark into one corner of your images by using one of BR, BL, TR, and TL.  These represent &#39;bottom-right&#39;, &#39;bottom-left&#39;, &#39;top-right&#39;, and &#39;top-left&#39; respectively. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use relative or absolute positioning for the watermark.  Relative positioning uses percentages; absolute positioning uses exact pixels.  You can mix and match these two modes of positioning, but you cannot mix and match relative/absolute with the corner positioning.  When using relative/absolute positioning, the value for the position parameter is XxY, where X is the left value and Y is the top value.  The left and top values must be separated with a lowercase x. </p>

<p>If you wanted your watermark image to show up in the center of any image you want to watermark, you would use a position parameter such as position=50%x50% or even position=C.  If you wanted the watermark to show up half-way between the left and right edges of the image and 100 pixels from the top, you would use a position parameter such as position=50%x100. </p>

<p>Finally, you may tell the filter to generate a position for your watermark dynamically.  To do this, use position=R. </p>

<p>opacityThis parameter allows you to specify the transparency of the applied watermark.  The value must be an integer between 0 and 100, where 0 is fully transparent and 100 is fully opaque.  By default, the opacity is set at 50%. </p>

<p>tileIf you want your watermark to tile across the entire image, you simply specify a parameter such as tile=1. </p>

<p>scaleIf you&#39;d like to have the watermark as big as possible on the target image and fully visible, you might want to use scale=F.  If you want to specify a particular scaling factor, just use something like scale=1.43. </p>

<p>greyscaleIf you want your watermark to be greyscale, you can specify the parameter greyscale=1 and all color saturation will go away. </p>

<p>rotationSet this parameter to any integer between 0 and 359 (really any integer should work, but for your own sanity I recommend keeping the value between 0 and 359).  If you want the rotation to be random, use rotation=R instead of an integer. </p>

<p>Examples{{ image_url|watermark:&quot;My Watermark,position=br,opacity=35&quot; }}Looks for a watermark named &quot;My Watermark&quot;, place it in the bottom-right corner of the target image, using a 35% transparency level. </p>

<p>{{ image_url|watermark:&quot;Your Watermark,position=tl,opacity=75&quot; }}Looks for a watermark named &quot;Your Watermark&quot;, place it in the top-left corner of the target image, using a 75% transparency level. </p>

<p>{{ image_url|watermark:&quot;The Watermark,position=43%x80%,opacity=40&quot; }}Looks for a watermark named &quot;The Watermark&quot;, places it at 43% on the x-axis and 80% of the y-axis of the target image, at a transparency level of 40%. </p>

<p>{{ image_url|watermark:&quot;The Watermark,position=R,opacity=10,rotation=45&quot; }}Looks for a watermark named &quot;The Watermark&quot;, randomly generates a position for it, at a transparency level of 10%, rotated 45 degrees. </p>

<p>{{ image_url|watermark:&quot;w00t,opacity=40,tile=1&quot; }}Looks for a watermark called &quot;w00t&quot;, tiles it across the entire target image, at a transparency level of 40%.</p>

 title : The agent-sherpa Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Abstract. The year is 2010. It is another boiling hot day somewhere in the outskirts of Tikrit. A modified UN Personnel carrier pulls up at a dusty crossroads. The rear gate drops to form an exit ramp, but no soldiers emerge. Instead a swarm of dozens of miniature drone vehicles roll from the truck and set about their work. Using GPS they negotiate the local road network, their job to scan and and clear the roadside of IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). They reason whether or not a device is an IED using data from different perceptors and use actuators to handle the device in various ways. A centralised Command &amp; Control unit monitors the drones and predicts locations of other IED&#39;s or &quot;hotspots&quot; of enemy activity. The road is rendered safe for the UN convoy delivering emergency aid to the beleaguered city ahead.</p>

 summary : <p>Air War is a turn-based strategy game of modern air warfare.  It features two sides, Red and Blue.  The red side has targets and air defense units with which to protect those targets.  The blue side has air units that seek to destroy the targets.  Red wins the game by exhausting all of blue&#39;s resources before all targets are destroyed.  Blue wins the game by destroying all red targets.  The game is turn-based in that red and blue set up the conditions for each mission before each turn is fought in a mission simulator.  The mission simulator determines the outcome of each mission in terms of targets and resources destroyed.  This repeats until the game is won.</p>

<p>Blogs. Although its quite possible for someone to contribute a module for blogging, there&#39;s already so many blog solutions out there, we haven&#39;t bothered to reinvent the wheel for this CMS. We&#39;ve stuck to the concept of &quot;pages&quot;.  You may &quot;aggregate&quot; your external blog entries into a page on your site via the RSS aggregation module. Technical Details: </p>

 title : The axedarea Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AxedArea is an editor widget written with the Google Web Toolkit, which isn&#39;t just a TextArea but also does not depend on browser specifc propertery builtin edit-extentions.  </p>

<p>In AxedArea everything is coded in GWT as far as the caret actually is a html div element. This allows an axedarea to be a lot more customized than an any editor using browser internal editor extentions. AxedArea is thus also W3C compatible!  </p>

<p>Release 1.2 is available! </p>

<p>View it: </p>

<p>You can view an Online Demo as used in an example gwt-project You can also view an Online JSNI-Demo or vimish Demo for use from plain javascript (look at the sourcecode of the html pages) </p>

<p>ChangeLog 1-2: </p>

<p>The core has been greatly changed. Many, many stones are now on different places.  Most notably changed the internals from int-arrays and offset pointing to an object-lists model. HtmlString handling is now thus quite simplified. This is in preparation to add new &quot;enriching&quot; elements like ranges targeted for version 1.3. There hardly should be any noticeable changes on the user-interface to 1.1. The editing performance should be vastly improved.  (Note: pasting huge blocks might however be worse right now, since there isn&#39;t just  yet a &quot;paste lazy calculation accelerator&quot; available for the new core.) </p>

<p>Also See:  </p>

<p>Documentation </p>

<p>License: </p>

<p>Axedarea is alternatively available with Apache License 2.0 or GPLv2 or any later GPL version. So licensing should hardly be an issue for anyone. </p>

 title : The bbclassic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BBClassicIs a simple clone of the classic BB board game. The main goals of this project are the game logic and design.  </p>

<p>Changelog04/08/08 - Used the Gui code from a prev project for this one. Starting to work on the team setup and possibly a full tournament system. Added ResourceManager to load all the graphics needed and keep them in on place. A lot of the code in the Gui module was reusable, but I need Entry, TextBox, and Listbox to get going on the initial menu states. </p>

<p>04/01/08 - Most recent svn has the movement mode, tackle mode, menu system with callbacks, and a new field graphic to name a few of the improvements. See all the changes here.  *new* field graphic </p>

<p>StatusThe current status of the game is not playable. Much of the core functionality is there, but the turn sequence and score keeping are not. There are a few reasons for this: </p>

<p>Makes testing individual functions easier Game flow and continuity are very easy to add when the api is already there </p>

<p>LicenseI&#39;m not a crazy Zealot about these things like most of you OSS peoples. Google Code has no Public Domain License or I would use it. I chose the BSD License because I think RMS is funny(looking) and I assume it will give you the freedom to do as you wish. </p>

<p>The intended future of BioView is to provide further easy to use components such as exon and chromosome mapping and visualisation tools. </p>

<p>All original code was made available under the BSD license and shall continue to be developed under this agreement.</p>

 title : The cjwizard Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CJWizard is an API for creating wizard dialogs in Java. </p>

<p>This library was spurred by my use of the Java Wizard library at Java.net (https://wizard.dev.java.net/).  That library offers a good framework for simple wizards, but it dictates a great deal of what you can do--justified by the java usability guidelines.  However, I don&#39;t believe all the restrictions actually are justified by those guidelines.  For example, it is particularly difficult to change the type of widget used on the left side of the wizards (it is initially an image with the list of wizard pages displayed over top of it).  Making this area interactive, as a global navigation tool, is non-trivial. </p>

<p>I also found it to be extremely cumbersome to define complex wizards that change their branching behavior at runtime.  Generally, I found the Java Wizard API to be difficult to use and at times contradictory.   </p>

<p>That said, I learned a lot from the Java Wizard API, and some of those ideas have been incorporated into CJWizards (which stands for Ciscavate Java Wizards, or something like that.  I had to call it something.) </p>

<p>Take a look at the FAQ and QuickStartGuide to get going, and send me questions if you have any. </p>

<p>ScreenshotsThis shows CJWizard in action, with a custom PageTemplate (drawing the list of dialog pages on the left) that wraps around a TitledPageTemplate (drawing the underlined title of the WizardPage).  The Windows L&amp;F was used to make it look like a native app.  (The Finish button is enabled because the surrounding app is robust to missing data, and allows for the user to come back to the wizard at a later date, if needed.  Generally, and by default, the Finish button is disabled if it is not explicitly enabled, which often happens in the render() method of the last WizardPage)</p>

 title : The descent-deep-assault Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Descent: Deep AssaultDescent: Deep Assault (possibly to be called Full Metal Drive) is an original game being developed alongside the Mocha Game Library, which is now hosted on Launchpad. It is partly inspired by the original Descent series of games (hence the name), but is original. The namesake is really an homage. </p>

<p>Descent is a top-down shooter wherein the player takes control of a hovercraft-like fighter. One of the story concepts includes the use of a full metal drive, the primary power source of the futuristic setting. The player maneuvers the fighter through deep space mines collecting fuel (so-called full metal) while destroying killer robots and carefully avoiding collisions and loss of control. </p>

<p>Planning and MigratingThe project is in a very preliminary state, especially while the Mocha Game Library transitions to Launchpad where it will (hopefully) mature. It will also be migrated to Launchpad once code is ready to be committed. This page will still be maintained, mostly for the wiki pages. Source code and issues will not be tracked here.</p>

 summary : <p>A comprehensive library for supporting various design computation functions </p>

<p>-- </p>

<p>Design computation has been a rapidly evolving field both in terms of engineering as well as architecture or in other words primarily geometrical. It covers a very well connected set of topics including shape representation and generation, parametric and generative algorithms which themselves depend on a parametric framework, digital modeling, simulation and geometrical analysis of form and shape grammar. </p>

<p>In spite of the large amount of literature and academic research on the same, there exists no open source or commercial application framework for performing these computations. In particular even though there is some activity going on in the field of form generation, there is hardly any common platform for implementation of various algorithms (genetic, evolutionary and otherwise) and generative methods of planning, layout etc dealing with the more rigorous parts of form generation. Also it is surprising that there exists no good system for major theories/ techniques such as Shape grammar or Pattern Language. Even critical necessities such as parametric geometry, pattern generation, are supported by no open source CAD application. The aim of the project is the implementation of a design computation library (DCL) which would enable researchers to deal with mathematical and computational aspects of design more easily, significantly reducing the reinvention of the wheel. The range of implementation is mostly in the realm of rigorous space planning, parametric and generative geometry, and shape grammar.</p>

 title : The design-scripting-library Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionDesign Scripting is a &quot;Visual Basic Scripting&quot; library suited for design purposes, namely CAD systems and 3D geometry. It contains a variety of vertex/vector functions but extends to more generic functionality such as file reading/writing etc. DSLib is a prototyping package for rapidly hacking and testing ideas before potentially hard coding design processes in more advanced languages. You can hack up from simple straight forward automation scripts to abstract generative processes without getting into the compile/debug world of computing or the painful world of pure macro command sequencing. </p>

<p>HistoryI begun writing DSLib while I was studying in MIT back in 2003. It was developed for general purpose scripting with a special focus on geometry. I have been using dslib mainly from within the Rhinoceros CAD environment, yet I tried to keep it free from a specific hosting application. Notice: as of version 2.0 some functionality that is Rhino specific has been added yet without creating dependencies. </p>

<p>PhilosophyScripting is an easy access point to computation that avoids the over-generalization syndrome of its underlying science but yet provides the facilities for expressive design experimentations. The Design Scripting Library was build in this gradual ad-hoc-ish mode in a necessity basis a.k.a. patchwork. It follows a multi paradigm approach borrowing concepts and functionality from both low level computer languages (see the c-flavored polymorphic sort for instance) and high level languages (see php-like echo function for another). </p>

<p>ParticipationI can no longer maintain DSLib by myself. If you are interested in writing new methods, correcting bugs, bettering the documentation send me a note. Contributions will be properly acknowledged.  </p>

<p>StructureThe library comes in two components: a pure set of scripting functions and an extension dynamic link library that overcomes the limitations of the programming language. The library is structured in contextual blocks (pseudo-namespaces) and I tried to enforce an object-oriented feel into the procedural nature of Basic. Most of the code is self-explanatory.  </p>

<p>Scripting is by nature slower than proper programming, therefore I decided to keep the code thin without any error checks etc. Performance sacrifices were made but only in terms of modularization and encapsulation.  </p>

<p>Loading and UsingDSLib is doing nothing by itself (this is a common question). You need to write some code that uses it. In version 1.0 all you need to do in order to start working with the library is to load it before your code. This can be done in a number of ways:  </p>

<p>Load it through your CAD GUI into the scripting engine  Load it in your application via a Scripting Control Control Load it internally from your script by reading the file in a string and globalexecute it As of version 2.0 the single file monolith was broken down into multiple files. This makes maintenance much easier. The process of loading the library is a bit different! You need to either: </p>

<p>Load all files using one of the previous methods Load only the dslib.vb file and call the load function that takes care of all other files.</p>

<p>Final Report Template PostedI have briefly created a template for our final report.  I&#39;ve attached both the 2007 version and 2003 version.  I have also attached one of the sample reports provided.   IMPORTANT:   In the Software Architecture Portion of the report:   Diagrams must be created - Please use the Attached ExampleReport2.pdf as a reference guide on how our diagrams and flow charts should look like. (Roger - you are the software architect, so the main class/engine flow diagrams should be your responsibility)   Detailed Module Structure Portion:   Please refer to the UML and flow chart diagrams used in the attached ExampleReport2.pdf.  I expect the same from everyone - Ideally, there should be a chart for each class, but some can be integrated into others.   Feature Descriptions Portion:   Each Feature description should follow this template: Rationale -1 Paragraph on the purpose of the feature. -1 Paragraph on why you did what you did in Brackets like this. Implementation -Paragraph(s) briefly describing how you implemented this feature and the process in which you came to the final implementation (describe failed attempts at additional features).   Outcome 1 paragraph to summarize the final Achievements and Failures (To show effort on advanced features). If you guys have any other questions, we can discuss it on Saturday at Lance&#39;s.  Also refer to the attached ExampleReport if you need examples.   BR,   Adrian </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to the Eclipse Scala Maven Integration. We aim to provide better support to both Q for eclipse (soon to be IAM) and the Scala Eclipse plugin, as well as integrating them together. This project is purposefully narrow in scope. This allows us (me) to focus our efforts and be able to maintain this integration. Ideals </p>

<p>The goals/ideals of this project are as follows: </p>

<p>Use existing plugins to the greatest extent possible Use Maven for our build system Use Scala as our core language Meet needs as they arise in the Eclipse/Scala/Maven world Support projects like Lift, which make use of Scala and Maven. Enjoy what we do Become a one-stop-shop for eclipse users who want Scala and Maven tools.  Note that this project houses not only the eclipse-maven-scala integration but also the integration between Scala and Maven.  Information on the Scala and Maven integration can be found at ScalaMavenSupport with a task list available at ScalaMavenSupportTaskList  </p>

<p>StatusThis project is temporarily on hold </p>

<p>For the meantime please follow the CreatingScalaMavenProjectsInEclipse wiki article to start using Scala and Maven together. </p>

<p>Pre ReleaseThere is an pre-pre-pre alpha available at the update site: http://esmi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/update_site_dev/. This requires you to already have the old, unreleased beta version of the Scala Eclipse plugin (at least the scala-library portion).   This should be updated in the coming weeks for scala 2.7.3 </p>

<p>Immediate Goals:Build System (Maven) Update-Site wiring (We should reference Scala and Q update sites from our own) Project Import/Creation integration between Q and Scala  Future Goals:m2e integration use scala:cc task for contious compilation Automated testing of esmi Continuous Integration of esmi Clean Scala SDT-RCP interface sbaz -&gt; maven dependency</p>
 summary : <p>Welcome to DEXEN, a design exploration system that uses evolutionary techniques to evolve and adapt designs to meet a set of design objectives. The key characteristics of DEXEN are as follows: </p>

<p>It is implemented in Python, and is currently Windows only (Macs and Linux to be added soon). It has been tested on XP and Vista. This current version has no graphical user interface. It is a system that requires the user to write a set of Python scripts that define the key evolutionary steps. These scripts will be executed by the system in order to run the evolutionary process. It is very flexible since the scripts can be used to implement a wide variety of evolutionary algorithms. In addition, these scripts can also be used as a way of linking to other software, such as CAD applications and simulation programs. It is reasonably fast since the system can be run on multiple computers in parallel. The architecture allows client computers to be easily added and removed from the evolutionary process.</p>

 title : The gaikokugo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is actually for my own personal use and is in very early stages.  It is an Eclipse RCP application that uses db4o for it&#39;s underlying database in order to aid language students by forcing them to enter their class notes in to an application and then receive automatically generated pop-tests. </p>

<p>While it is an Eclipse application, I have also tried to stick to OSGi fundamentals where possible.  That said, the project is only aimed at Java 5 enviroments. </p>

<p>Since this is a personal work in progress, it is unlikely there will ever be a binary distribution.  Feel free to checkout the code and build it for yourself.  Each folder off the trunk is an Eclipse project.  To run it from the PDE launch it from the product file: uk.org.brindy.gaikokugo.rcp/product/gaikokugo.product </p>

<p>If you find it useful or have some ideas for features just let me know through the usual channels. </p>

<p>Finally, in case you&#39;re wondering, gaikokugo is Japanese for &quot;foreign-language&quot; and it just happens to be Japanese that I am studying.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one reason d&#39;etre, but to those who argue that is insufficient justification for its existence, that Git is already fast enough - it is a first step towards applying decentralizing Peer to Peer concepts to Git.  If you decentralize the download layer, it&#39;s just another small step before you decentralize the push rights and tie it to a web of trust such as PGP, and then you don&#39;t actually need discrete mirror sites.  Every mirror can track the git repositories the owners want it to carry, and those authorized to sign updates can make signed updates to push the cloud forward.  Your local mirror can become a one-stop git push and pull stop depot, and the source code is preserved in many more places, increasing resilience, availability and download performance for all. </p>

<p>These longer-term plans would have been included in the RFC, but for a desire to keep it simple and build the first layer first. </p>

<p>Status and HistoryLast status announcement was at August 2008.  That demonstrated a program which started two gittorrent daemons, which connect to each other over TCP and exchange a repository using the messages in the RFC. </p>

<p>So, initially, Jonas came up with the idea and made a thesis out of it.  Along the way it was I think mentioned on #git, and I (Sam) got involved, reviewed the design and came up with a design that did not require unnecessary extra indexes to be distributed among peers, while still making good use of delta compression.  ie, when pulling over a limited bandwidth connection there should be minimal extra downloaded compared to pulling from one server. </p>

<p>So, we&#39;ve been through 2 rounds of Google Summer of Code participation, and a small amount of time from me (Sam) in getting it this far.  Currently no-one is (to my knowledge) actively developing either this developed version (sorry, I don&#39;t get paid for this, it&#39;s really just when I have the time, inclination etc) or Jonas&#39; C++ implementation. </p>

<p>What&#39;s likely to happen next is that at the GitTogether, this will be explained and a simple path forward laid that will layer this technology over git&#39;s native protocol, and leave the BitTorrent baggage behind.  If there is sufficient interest, then the project may get another breath of life. </p>

<p>Welcome SlashdottersIt has been pointed out that there has been no update on what happened at GitTogether.  Basically, as the final paragraph in the above points out, it needs to work over the git:// protocol to be useful, and as it turns out the design of git makes this much simpler than I originally thought.  A proof of concept could in principle be thrown together as a single script loosely based on the existing Perl implementation, and a trivial patch to the git-daemon to enable it.  I&#39;ve put the sketch of this on this wiki using the name it will probably end up with - &quot;MirrorSync&quot; </p>

<p>Prototypes for the individual messages are still pending, but hopefully you can see that the design is now sufficiently simple that this shouldn&#39;t be an arduous task... take a look and please comment if you&#39;ve something to add!</p>

 title : The gle-mips Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to GLE-MiPS    </p>

<p>This site features a collection of different kind of processors, described in pure vhdl code. All started with a MIPS-like non pipelined cpu from which several branches spawned!  </p>

<p>Right now the following types of processor are available, but many more will be added in the future! </p>

<p>GLE-MiPS - A fully working microprocessor, featuring a complete set of mathematical and logical operations over integer numbers, with the addition of two memory modules, RAM and ROM; it is synthetizable both in 32 and in 64 bits mode. A crosscompiler is available, written in Java, 3k-cc. QUATTRO - A microprocessor for small embedded devices, with strict size and speed requirements! Uses 8 bit instructions for a 4 bit architecture. It&#39;s basically a shrinked down, 4 bit version of GLE-MiPS (spawned from version 1.1). GLX - A written from scratch processor, implementing a non pipelined DLX structure, with Very Long Instruction Word support, allowing parallel execution of two instructions. It doesn&#39;t have the mathematical capabilities of GLE-MiPS but has a revised logicals module and comparison capabilities. News07/08/2008 - QUATTRO 1.1 - Thanks to the knowledge acquired in the GLX development, a newer, faster version of QUATTRO is available! The new structure doesn&#39;t use the big GLE-MiPS macroblocks any more, but relies on small modules, achieving greater performance. </p>

<p>05/08/2008 - GLX 1.0 - Finally available, the DLX processor implementation with Very Long Instruction Word support. It comes with physical design reports, Synopsys scripts and the related cross-compiler. </p>

<p>28/07/2008 - GLX PREVIEW - Here is available for download a preview release of a DLX implementation! It&#39;s still not complete as it&#39;s lacking of the pipeline and several other features, but it&#39;s in a good shape for general testing. </p>

<p>25/07/2008 - 3k-cc BETA 1 - After a long time announcement, it is finally here! The compiler for the GLE-MiPS has just been released! It&#39;s still a beta as it still needs some testing, but it&#39;a bless for GLE-MiPS testers out there. </p>

 title : The golfml Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The purpose of GolfML is to provide a XML-based file format for the exchange of golf-related data. </p>

<p>There are numerous golf scorecard programs and online web sites that allow golfers to browse course information, print scorecards, keep track of scores, and analyze statistics, or view a Google Earth fly-over of each hole. </p>

<p>Most programs or web sites use proprietary data representation and only few of them allow for data exchange of course descriptions such as scorecard, hole par, length and handicap strokes. If available, data import or export is often performed in site- or application-specific proprietary format. </p>

<p>We promote the use of a vendor-neutral, open data format for the exchange of golf-related data like golf course descriptions, or golfer scorecards. </p>

<p>The markup language will focus on: </p>

<p>The description of golf courses The golfer&#39;s logbook, with scorecards and statistics The first part of this project defines a uniform data format to present golf course information such as name, address, number of courses, available facilities, course description, individual hole tee length, par, handicap strokes, etc. This data format also allows definition of geographic areas such as coordinates (of tees, holes, trees and traps...) or surfaces (such as fairways, bunkers, greens, lake...). It also permit references to files like pictures, video, or other media. </p>

<p>The second part of the project defines a data format to allow golfer to record scores, statistics, and golf equipment. Scores can be as simple as stroke counts or as complex as location-based individual stroke record. </p>

<p>This project will not deliver software code. It will deliver a vocabulary, XML specifications and references to allow for data exchange between golf software applications. </p>

 summary : <p>Google users will use their Google account to access this new application.  This application will be available anywhere the user can get internet.  Google Classroom will be a content management system that students can use through their Google account.  The interface would be similar to other content management systems such as Angel, but is not University driven.  As a result, the users will be able to customize the system to fit their needs.   </p>

<p>The system will link with other Google applications, such as Google Docs, and Google Calendar, to increase usability.  Users will be able to add their courses to the system. Within each course, it will be possible to take notes, upload documents, manage due dates, and meeting times, etc.  The overall goal for this project will be to draw more users to the Google Corporation.  Google Classroom will appeal to the younger generation of users.  These users are mostly likely in high school and college.  Google Classroom will target this segment of the market.</p>

 summary : <p>This project provides a user interface to Hackystat data based upon the Simile/Timeline system.  </p>

<p>The goal is to provide a way to create a timeline in which each single time line represents developer activity using a type of tool.  For example, one time line could represent the use of the Eclipse tool over time, with various significant events (compile, etc.) noted along it.  Another time line could represent unit testing, another SVN commits, and so forth.  </p>

<p> 
<br/>The result provides insight into the patterns of development that occur, as well as gaps during development where nothing seems to be happening. Such &#39;Dead Time&#39; could be as interesting and important to the overall productivity and effectiveness of development as the periods of time where development is occuring.</p>

 summary : <p>This project is a rewrite of the ISPMan project. </p>

<p>ISPMan was written in 2000 because at that there was no other project to do what we wanted to do. </p>

<p>Lot of things have changed since then. There are exciting new technologies, new products and installation of complex projects have become easy </p>

<p>This new project will do all that ISPMan does and more. This time we have something to use as example so the project will be much more structured. </p>

<p>DEMO See links on the right panel To login to the demo use the username admin@localhost and password secret </p>

<p>ISPDirector will provide multiple interfaces to multiple roles. </p>

<p>CLI interface to administrators. Web interface to administrators/resellers/customers URL based like interface to developers/tools with output in multiple formats (JSON, Serialized php, xml, etc) </p>

<p>The application design will be done with all the experince gained in the isp industry and with all the mistakes that we have made (so you dont have to) and learned from. </p>

<p>Things will be kept simple.  </p>

<p>For example we will use MySQL as the main storage backend. 
<br/>Where LDAP is needed, the data will be generated as required. </p>

<p>The project is open source and will be available in  </p>

 title : The jaac Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The proposed solution is to create a proxy class (as provided by Java&#39;s reflection package) together with an annotated interface which indicates the appropriate &quot;undo&quot; for each method. This allows a class&#39; code to remain direct and uncluttered; the actions are generated at runtime and stored or undone by external handlers. </p>

<p>The problem is how to both use the command design pattern and retain the cohesion of directly implemented code. The command pattern promotes a method call to an object, improving program flexibility. The cost is source cohesion; either command code is injected into class, or the class&#39; behavior is extracted into command subclasses. </p>

<p>Two sample applications are implemented using the suggested solution: a min-max tic-tac-toe player and a backtracking sudoku solver, which extends the action class to provide transactions.</p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionAspect Oriented is a paradigm of development that grows day by day. Visualize how this aspects affect the whole application is a difficult matter of study. This project helps the software developer and architect to have the vision of how any AOP application is constructed and how each component interacts with each other. </p>

<p>ProblemWe need to identify and show how aspects interfere within the system model. </p>

<p>SolutionAt first we thought of a solution similar to how a compiler parses a portion of code, analyzes it grammatically and then generates a sense of code to be interpreted by a virtual machine or an operating system. In an analog way, in our solution we have to think about a source code program that has to be parsed to build a kind of basic and generic scene and finally this scene be shown in an specific visualizer.  </p>

<p>The sense of divide it in three components makes the solution more flexible, providing pluggable components in the parser or either in the adapter. That is, you can choose any parser if you give to the model builder what it needs and you can choose any visualizer if you build the adapter to show the scene. </p>

<p>ConclusionWe have investigated so far many possibilities to solve the cited problem discovering that in the field of AOP, AspectJ has become the widely-used de-facto standard by emphasizing simplicity and usability for end users. The lack of tools that can clearly show how the aspects crosscut the different model objects makes our approach an amazing challenge to help AOP developers to have a full comprehension of how the system is interacting. </p>

 summary : <p>Background StoryOne day, I went home after work, and wanted to watch TV Play downloaded in my laptop, but...it seemed that something important needed to be done. So I wrote all the things on paper, what I should do first? and what was the last. </p>

<p>Tasks I need to do  Importance  Urgent Level   Call back to my mum for greeting  a little important(2)  a little urgent(2)   Cook for my wife  most important(5)  urgent(3)   Watch TV Play  not important(1)  not urgent(1)   Read one chapter of python  important(3)  urgent(3)   Fix a known bug in my product  very important(4)  very urgent(4)  </p>

<p>Compare all the tasks, what should I do first? Apparently, I have to cook for my wife at first, and then fix the known bug in my product, after that, I should read one chapter of python e-book, and then call back to my mum. At last, if I have enough time I can watch TV play for a season. </p>

<p>After organizing my tasks, the order is totally changed: </p>

<p>What I should do  Importance  Urgent Level   Cook for my wife  most important(5)  urgent(3)   Fix a known bug in my product  very important(4)  very urgent(4)   Read one chapter of python  important(3)  urgent(3)   Call back to my mum for greeting  a little important(2)  a little urgent(2)   Watch TV Play  not important(1)  not urgent(1)  </p>

 summary : <p>A collection of graphing widgets designed to be integrated into KDE 4.This project was started due to the lack of standard graphing components in KDE.  As it is today, any developer wishing to incorporate graphing of date into their application must create the graph widget him/herself.  This leads to many different, poorly performing and unattractive graph widgets throughout KDE applications. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to make graphing widgets which borrow from tricks devised by the computer game industry over the years to create high performance, beautiful graph widgets for a wide variety of uses.  The intent is to create everything from bar graphs to line graphs to cartesian coordinate graphs to speedometer-like analog meters.</p>

 summary : <p>There are plenty of tools that do specific functions, or a range of technical functions (NMAP, Nessus). However, there are not many open source tools to help manage the scope of the testing a system. Lockpick will fill that role. When I start a penetration test, Lockpick will provide my checklists and script resources and update my tools. For intelligence gathering, Lockpick will let me create profiles for target companies and persons. I can shell out to my normal tool suite and organize my log files and other output with the tool. Eventually, I can use Lockpick to pull all of the testing data together and generate an executive summary and detail report with the logs and profiles for addenda.</p>

 summary : <p>Introduction to LonghouseThis project page represents the Longhouse project, begun by Informatics students at the University of California, Irvine, in conjunction with representatives of Google Code.  </p>

<p>Longhouse is an open-source collaborative development environment (CDE) based on Google Code. Longhouse provides software project hosting, issue tracking, and a space for collaborative work on software projects. Unlike Google Code, Longhouse is intended for small- to medium-sized organizations or communities that wish to host their own software projects. Thus, Longhouse may be installed on a modern personal computer or small- to medium-sized server to serve your organization&#39;s project hosting and management needs.  </p>

<p>Longhouse employs a unique means of storing project data and making data accessible, storing information in XML format on your organization&#39;s Subversion repository. This means that you can edit any project artifacts outside the Longhouse Web UI, commit the modified XML files to your Subversion repository, and have Longhouse automatically take into account your changes.  </p>

<p>Longhouse aims to preserve the usability paradigms of Google applications while adding additional usability optimizations designed to maximize understandability, new-user-friendliness and productivity. </p>

<p>We invite you to learn more about Longhouse, and to get Longhouse. </p>

 summary : <p>MACDADI has gone live! Try our prototype MACDADI server. </p>

<p>AEC professionals need to define goals, propose options, analyze these options with respect to the goals, and make decisions. Design is a social and technical process; they need to coordinate these processes and information amongst a wide range of team members and stakeholders. MACDADI (which stand for Multi-Attribute, Collaborative Design, Assessment, and Decision Integration) is designed to help establish teams, collect and hierarchically organize project goals; establish priorities; analyze design options with respect to the goals; and assist in a transparent and formal trade-off and decision making process. </p>

<p>Project Description:Agent is a software entity which has the capability of performing autonomous actions on behalf of its user or owner. A Multiagent System (MAS) is a software system which consists of a number of agents that interact with each other using an Agent Communication Language or Protocol. Autonomous behavior of a software agent makes analysis of the MAS behavior hard and complicated. UML models, such as interaction and collaboration diagrams can examine the internal behavior of the MAS accurately and effectively, because they can depict the communication among agents and possible emergent behavior or deadlocks with appropriate details.   In this project we will design and implement a software application that accepts at its input the specification of an existing multiagent system and produces a suitable behavioral model compliant with UML 2.0 as its output. The reason of using UML 2.0 is its expressive potential and its wide acceptance. </p>

<p>Steps and objectives which are defined for this project:1-Choosing the most suitable MAS development specification methodology. </p>

<p>2-Designing a multiagent system using the development methodology’s constructs and models. </p>

<p>3-Design and implementation of an application that converts the developed multiagent system’s model to a compliant UML 2.0 behavioural model.  </p>

<p>4-Verification and validation of the application. </p>

<p>Required skills/knowledge:1-Being familiar with agent based software engineering and multiagent system. ( Training session will be provided)  </p>

<p>2-Good knowledge of UML diagrams and their usage in software modeling. </p>

<p>3-Good knowledge of programming with one of the programming languages like C++, C# or Java.   </p>

<p>Remark:The development process will be guided and monitored by a MSc. student who has the role of the customer’s representative in the development team to help the developers in clarifying the concepts and help them to gain background knowledge which is necessary for this project. </p>

I am using Visual C# 2005 Express and the XNA Game Studio 2.0 in order to get this finished much quicker than just using DirectX or Windows GDI+ or something else. It was a game that I created in the mid-1990s.  I created it as a result of my learning how to program in C. It was developed through the reading of the book Teach Yourself Game Programming In 21 Days by Andre LaMothe. </p>

 summary : <p>Milk: Make include list kit - Black Math edition </p>

<p>Reusing JSDB (from Shanti Rao), which is basically a host embdedding SpiderMonkey, Milk provide some common build tasks for your ECMAScript projects in a command-line tool. </p>

<p>Wait... </p>

<p>First, JSDB realy is a great tool, and even if you can compile it in such a way that you can obtain an executable for Windows and Linux, you can obtain only a command-line tool, and Milk just crave for a GUI. </p>

<p>Second, Milk in JSDB is already done, but honestly the code just sucks and I&#39;m ashamed of it, and worst the tool smells the unmaintainable big ball of mud coded in 2 days smells. </p>

<p>So, Milk will be based on Apollo and be redone from scratch and hopefully have an improved design. </p>

<p>My goal for Milk is to make a swiss army knife for building any ECMASCript source code. </p>

<p>Another goal (and not a secondary one) is to provide a &#39;GUI in context&#39;, that means depending on the context of your task compiling Flex2 / compacting JavaScript / etc. the visuals and options of Milk change dynamically. </p>

<p>Priority One Features planed: </p>

<p>one executable/host, no dependencies, cross-platform Win/Mac (Linux if possible) a comprehensive GUI but still powerfull command-line arguments combine multi files to one file remove comments from source code compact source code General Features planed: </p>

<p>GUI panel to compile with Flex 2 compiler GUI panel to compile Apollo applications ECMAScript config files save/load config files different profile (dev, release, debug, etc.) zip files/releases upload files/zip to FTP generate a detailled log of the building run unit tests generate unit tests generate ReadMe, etc. from template get info from Subversion This project will start as soon a public alpha/beta for Apollo will appear AND will support exe access.</p>

 summary : <p>minivecA pure python 2D vector class for general use. There are several reasons why a developer would choose this class over other choices. </p>

<p>Flexible ArgumentsAny method or operator requiring a vector should accept as many types of objects as possible. This includes single number values, any object that is a pair of numbers, or any object with a vec2 attribute that is a pair of numbers. </p>

<p>Floating PointAll values and math should be done with floating point values. Any arguments passed as integers will be coerced as necessary. </p>

<p>Immutable methodsAll methods and operators return new vectors, and each one is immutable. </p>

<p>Error resistantThere will be no errors with zero length normals. Some operations may not be defined, but DivideByZero exception will never be raised. </p>

<p>FastVector operations should be as fast as possible. But speed should not interfere with any of the above features. It turns out that this vector class is one of the fastest available. Out performing other pure python implementations that offer a less convenient interface. </p>

 title : The mythos Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mythos is a GUI library written in C++ using modern C++ techniques.  While it is functional, it is for the most part a proof of concept for several ideas I had w/ regard to GUI libraries.  Mythos is divided into four sub-libraries: </p>

<p>khaos - khaos handles platform/window system abstraction.  It provides a simple, generic API to create/manipulate windows, create/use fonts, and define a program&#39;s entry point.  It also contains some font rendering code, though this should really be part of an extension to Boost.GIL (Adobe&#39;s Generic Image Library).  Currently the only working backend to khaos is the x11 backend.  There is also a backend that uses wxWidgets, but it is broken (see wxWidgetsBackend for more info). annex - annex is a small library packaged with khaos that deals with plugins.  It is used by gaia. nyx - nyx is a window layout library.  It contains a DSEL (Domain Specific Embedded Language) that allows users to specify a window&#39;s layout without having to resort to specific values or layout classes (as done in gtk).  The resulting code will also give an idea as to what the layout will look like:     layout(my_window, padx, pady) =
<br/>        rows[ &quot;Hello world!&quot;            ]
<br/>            [ button1 | right[button2]  ]
<br/>        ;iris - iris is the event handling part of Mythos.  It allows users to associate actions (functions or functors) with events through the use of another DSEL, then attach the created event handlers to windows:     // from the custom gaia implementation example
<br/>    namespace on = mythos::iris::on;</p>

<p>    checkbox_state_type state;</p>

<p>    iris::event_handler evts =
<br/>        // state is copied and stored in the event_handler.  it is passed to the following actions, when the event occurs.
<br/>        iris::context(state)
<br/>        [
<br/>            (on::l_button_down | on::l_button_up)   [change_checkbox_state], // change_checkbox_state is a function
<br/>            on::paint                               [checkbox_paint]         // ditto
<br/>        ]
<br/>        ;</p>

<p>    // add evts to my_window&#39;s intrusive list of event_handlers using the connect function, which was shamelessly stolen
<br/>    // from wxWidgets
<br/>    my_window.connect(evts);</p>

<p>    // each nyx::window also contains a event_handler whose lifetime the window manages.  this way a window can hold and
<br/>    // manage state if it needs to, while still keeping the details transparent with regard to the user.
<br/>    my_window.events() = evts;gaia - gaia handles widget toolkit abstraction.  It consists primarily of free functions that take data and create widgets (which are returned as nyx::windows).  Data is passed to these functions mostly by reference.  This way, users can manipulate widgets, without needing small, separate APIs for each widget.  For example, to create a checkbox, then change whether the checkbox is checked, one would need to do the following:     bool value = true;</p>

<p>    // value is held by reference
<br/>    nyx::window cb = gaia::checkbox(value);</p>

<p>    // ... layout/show toplevel window ...</p>

<p>    // uncheck the checkbox
<br/>    value = false;
<br/>    iris::paint(cb);While this does help to simplify things (no special checkbox class, no need to intrusively find and modify data held by the window), it requires the user to manage data.   
<br/>gaia is also pluggable.  This means users can, theoretically, switch between different toolkits at runtime.  To load gaia, an init function must be called (gaia::init(...)).  There are two init functions, one loads a specific gaia implementation, and the other finds and loads a default one.  Unfortunately, the latter has not been implemented. 
<br/>Currently there are no implementations of gaia (save a sample one, and one based on wxWidgets, which cannot be used). 
<br/>To build Mythos with bjam, run bjam with --platform=x11 or whatever the target platform is meant to be.  The environment variable BOOST_ROOT must be set. </p>

<p>Mythos uses the following libraries: </p>

<p>GIL 2.1  Boost (SVN) Boost.Switch fontconfig freetype Xlib </p>

<p>Mythos has been tested on gcc 4.1.2 under Ubuntu.</p>

 summary : <p>Donate via Payal </p>

<p>NIBZ is a compact innovative microprocessor described in VHDL. The innovation is based around how the machine encodes instructions. There are 16 basic instructions and one advanced call instruction. The advanced call instruction gives the density of direct threaded code with the speed of subroutine threaded code. Certain choices of instruction were purposefully left out. A good example being a literal value load. When threaded code is analyzed, it can be seen that this instruction would not be used very often, as the placement of that value onto a stack makes for extra instructions, loosing code density. </p>

<p>There is an (A)ccumulator and 4 main registers </p>

<p>(P)rogram Counter (the code flow) (Q)uality Register (adds some quality and memory indexing ability easy) (R)eturn Stack Pointer (the threading and route to literal fetching and branching) (S)tack Pointer (for ALU and data operation) This processor is dedicated to the Moores and the more&#39;s and the moors. </p>

<p>The 16 basic instructions are encoded in the low nibble of a machine code word. The advanced call instruction is identified by being greater than 15. This has many benefits, including elimination of some branch delay slots in a full pipeline architecture, and effective little-endian load pre-decoding. It must be noted that the memory organization is big endian, even though fetches and stores are done in little endian order. </p>

<p>From NibzX onwards a 3 in 1 opcode compression feature has been added. This uses the lower 16K words to present virtual subroutines of 3 instructions. This is the video area too on the ReferenceSystem and so has no conflict. </p>

<p>The first project phase is complete with a half width data bus for using cheaper memory. This places total instruction fetch and execution time to 5 cycles. The second project phase concentrating on the IO is now in progress. </p>

<p>Phase 1 : Processor Phase 2 : An IO standard (Graphics, Sound, SPI Boot, SD Card, 2*8 Bit Ports) Phase 3 : A Hardware Reference Phase 4 : An Emulator Phase 5 : Multi-processing To Clarify Licence IssuesA one core (single instruction stream execution) per chip (piece of silicon/SOI/GaAs cut to fit a mounting) licence is available for free. This allows use in propritory designs, while still allowing full utility (any number of cores) in open BSD designs. The instruction design is well suited to dataflow multiple dispatch, with the elimination of cycle overheads of stack shuffling.  </p>

<p>Have a look at the InstructionSet for more details. The VHDL is OpenSource BSD and the VHDL was produced with the aid of Altera Quartus II. This project will be given a boost by the development of a Forth language system for it. The this is started on Gforth for nibz . A J2MERef java source of the instuction operation is available, to be used in an emulator, although it is quite old and has not been modified to the new instruction timings. </p>

<p>A hardware ReferenceSystem is in the design process. </p>

<p>This is an n+4 design all extension is via n+5, etc..  For an insight on how generalization to programming of Objects will occur, Think Object Transfer Language, although this is a long way off. </p>

<p>Check VersionList for version details and extras. Try WhatIsVHDL too, to see an old version. </p>

<p>The OldDesign indi proessor is now not developed, but the design can be downloaded. The reason for the change is obvious when threaded code is considered. </p>

 title : The nuclear-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project NuclearProject Nuclear seeks to create a set of high quality samplers, synthesizers and effects on the GNU/Linux platform and facilitate tools for their development. To do so we maintain our own developer friendly SDK to make the job fun again. </p>

<p>The Nuclear SDK will be in the form of header-only libraries, similar to Boost, with no need for their own compilation. Just include them in your code and take advantage of the functions they offer. </p>

<p>Project Nuclear always welcome new DSP wizards, graphic designer elves and developer orchs to join our cause and start develop synthesizers and effects as part of the project. But you are just as welcome if all you want is to deploy our SDK in your own project. </p>

<p>Google Code host our developer documentation wiki, subversion repository and issue tracker while our main site contains information about our community and plugins. </p>

<p>Why “Nuclear?”At first, the name was meant to be poking fun at Native Instrument’s Reaktor, calling it Nuklear at the time. Failing to come up with any better name, we decided to stick with Nuclear, going with the English spelling to hopefully avoid any trademark trouble. The “Project” part got tacked on because there was already a project called “Nuclear” out there on SourceForge. </p>

<p>Who is “We?”The Nuclear Project currently consists of Anders Dahnielson, of Sweden, and Darren Landrum, of the United States. </p>

<p>Contacting UsDarren Landrum can be contacted directly at dmlandrum at gmail dot com. We can also be contact through our Google Group.</p>

Cuando el pedal esté apagado o inactivo, la señal pasa de manera pasiva por este, por lo que no se ve alterada, hacia los otros pedales conectados a la cadena de modo que cualquier combinación de efectos en la cadena pueda ser creada sin tener que conectar y desconectar cajas de efectos al estar en una presentación o ensayo. La señal puede ser direccionada a través de las cajas de efectos con cualquier combinación, pero lo más común es poner la señal de distorsión. Para reconocer el tipo de efecto que se tiene en el pedal se tiene un display que desplegara el efecto seleccionado por el usuario.</p>

 title : The photoflip Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project has been cancelled, nobody is working on it right now!2009-10-06: DO NOT USE PHOTOFLIPPlease don&#39;t try to use PhotoFlip if you&#39;re not a developer, it&#39;s not in a usable state! Softpedia has started distributing our ALPHA-QUALITY archive without prior notification, this was neither expected nor asked from us. We doubt anyone has managed to run it anyway since the required libraries are not available anymore. </p>

<p>PhotoFlip is a photo managing software featuring a smooth 3d interface enabling you to browse seemlessly through your photos, as if they were right in your hands. You can tag your photos, organize them into separate collections, customize photo frames and add background music while browsing a collection. </p>

<p>News2007-11-14: Development updateWe are working on a whole new codebase for PhotoFlip 0.3, our next experimental version. We chose to get rid of Gtk/Glib as a whole, loosing some really useful API functions but gaining in size, portability, and in the long run this will certainly prove to be a better option. </p>

<p>So what is going on right now? The new code uses SDL as its base input/output library. I&#39;m working on a (great) OpenGL-cairo GUI interface which meets our specific needs for a fullscreen application with multiple tool-windows in it, a dock, etc. </p>

<p>2007-10-24: First version releasedWe just released the first PhotoFlip development version. This is ALPHA-QUALITY software and may DAMAGE YOUR DATA (although it didn&#39;t while we tested it, of course). There are already quite a lot of functions working, but many are still work in progress. We encourage you to test PhotoFlip 0.1.0 and give us feedback. </p>

<p>You can find Linux, Windows and source packages on the Featured Downloads list on your right.  </p>

<p>In order to run PhotoFlip, you will need the gtkmm 2.12 (2.10 should work too) runtime package (it should include libglademm too) and the gtkglextmm 1.2 package. Under Linux, these packages should be in your distribution&#39;s package manager. Here are links for win32 runtime packages: </p>

 summary : <p>Phrasis is a is a stripped down text editor.

Therefore, we&#39;ve created an interface with only the bare essentials, no menus, no formating features and no nonsense. </p>

<p>Please comment and help improve the product. Phrasis only edits text files, so other formats must be converted to text or they show up as gobbledygook. We support Unicode, so non-English and multilingual documents are acceptable. </p>

<p>Our first public release should occur in January 2007. In the mean time, feel free to download the development version from svn and compile it yourself. </p>

<p>NewsApr 20, 2009 - The latest PropTCP beta has been released.  It can be downloaded at http://harrisonpham.com/embedded/PropTCP/beta/. </p>

<p>Mar 21, 2008 - Yes we are still working on the code base.  We are testing the stack on numerous network configurations to ensure it works.  You can still download betas at the beta site listed above. </p>

<p>Dec 14, 2007 - Beta revisions are now available at: http://harrisonpham.com/embedded/PropTCP/beta/.  All stable releases will still be posted to this site in the Downloads section.  Remember, betas will change often and may not always work 100%.  Do not use Beta code in production environments. </p>

<p>Nov 27, 2007 - The new sockets layer API and code base are being finalized.  We are very close to a release candidate.  We are hoping to have a release ready within the next week. </p>

<p>Nov 12, 2007 - The enc28j60 driver bug fix has been uploaded to the download section.  It is recommended that all users update to this new driver since it fixes a critical hang bug associated with packet collisions.  A new version of the http server example has been posted (no functionality changes other than vga debug information and updated drivers). </p>

<p>Nov 4, 2007 - A bug with the enc28j60 driver was recently found where excessive collisions or late collisions would cause the driver to lock up.  The bug is not documented anywhere (not even in the enc28j60 datasheets / erratas).  A fix should be released soon that is based on Microchip&#39;s driver which contains some slightly hacky code to fix the undocumented issue. </p>

 summary : <p>Cards are distributed in a pattern like this. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The bottom row of cards is face up, and the rows above that are all face down. As soon as a card does not have cards laying on top of it, it may be flipped over and shown to the player.  The cards in the lowest row will sit on top of the cards in the row above them so as to not make the cards accessible until they are uncovered.  The player will then be able to deal the rest of the 24 cards one by one to the discard pile. </p>

<p>The goal of the game is to get every card off of the pyramid and into the discard pile. </p>

It requires only the name of the module to generate its testcases, except in the case of customization.The use of the GUI is optional as the test cases could be generated with the CLI itself. </p>

<p>The Project aims at making the life of the python developers and unit testers easy.The generation of the test cases have been simplified to its very basic extent. the performance of the tool is high as it could generate thousands of cases in seconds. </p>

<p>Functional UpdatesThe functional update is that the mode of generation is extended to user levels of customizations and operating from file levels to generate cases is also made possible </p>

<p>The generators next focus would be on the web category which will handle the web based testcases and api&#39;s for handling the web frameworks and testing their components. </p>

<p>Planned UpdatesThe next version of the test generator will have a feature of comparing the generated values with the csv or a text based file. The customization past of the application will be extended further to provide more functionality.</p>

<p>Running SoSSos currently runs from a floppy disk, or from a CD. There is a CD iso of the new version of SoS available for download, but this only prints the line &quot;Welcome to SoS version 0.0.1&quot;. The code is just as boring, as I have only just started re-writing it from scratch. </p>

 summary : <p>SAX based Extended Event Driven XML Parser for C++ </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Building DOM tree is the simplest way to parse an XML document and extract details. It is widely used in a variety of applications spanning business domains - simple desktop applications, enterprise applications and large scale web applications. In a large scale application or in B2B scenario the XML document tends to quiet huge in the order 100s of GBs, in which case building a DOM tree would simply not be possible because of memory limitations. There is absolutely no point in building a DOM tree if it cannot fit into physical main memory. The alternative is to use SAX parsers. SAX parser are too basic and are not a natural fit for the problem. </p>

<p>History </p>

<p>I was present with the problem of parsing an XML file of size 2GB (back in 2002 when the world was still using 32-bit systems) with a certain processing time requirement. I looked at the options I had and decided to write a threaded variant of SAX parser that would be easy enough to use like DOM trees but be memory efficient and agile as SAX parser. I called it the SEED parser (the project was a success, by the way). Recently I ran into a team which was struggling to address this problem, and was pleasantly surprised. I thought I should re-write my idea and open source the code. Hence this project. </p>

<p>Solution </p>

<p>The approach is rather simple. SAX is event driven but the events are low level tags, values and end tags notification. I extended the event notification on a subscription basis for XML paths. There are two kinds of subscriptions you can make, SAX subscriptions and DOM subscriptions. SAX subscription can support sub-subscriptions, and receives notifications that SAX parsers support. DOM subscription receives DOM tree for that path. There are two types of notifications - synchronous and asynchronous. Asynchronous is thread based. Mix matching all the provisions you can build parsing logic to parse huge XML files and maintain synchronization in the logic parser. </p>

<p>Example </p>

<p>If you have a 2 GB file like </p>

<p>     ... Unknown end tag for </p>

<p>Unknown end tag for </p>

<p>if you want to process order you would register SAX subscriber for /root called SAX-Root, register synchronous DOM-SUBSCRIBER orders/meta-data under SAX-Root and register asynchronous DOM-SUBSCRIBER for orders/order under SAX-Root. </p>

<p>SpellCore is a an open-architecture spelling/orthography-changing engine for minority languages.   </p>

<p>In a typical language development project, workers use four or more applications to produce vernacular materials (i.e. reading primers, dictionaries, books).  Because these are non-commercially interesting languages, ready-made spell-checkers are not available.  Some applications have their own way to spell check anyhow, but the resulting list of good and bad words is not generally reusable in the other applications.  So the first thing  SpellCore offers is a database of spelling information which is usable by multiple applications. </p>

<p>Recognizing the needs of languages where &#39;correct-spelling&#39; is an elusive target, SpellCore goes way beyond &#39;correct/incorrect&#39; lists to include plug-ins that measure suspiciousness. That is, if a word is not known to be right or wrong, does it seem likely to be wrong? Two measures that have proven useful are: </p>

<p>Structure (e.g. syllable structure, composed of morphemes found in a dictionary and conforming to known morphological grammar rules). Similarity (e.g. one key away from a known-good word see edit distance) Equivalent Transliterations (Eaton &amp; Penny) </p>

<p>Architectural OverviewA core library/api, named SpellCore (previously codenamed Panang), sits in-between the client pieces and particular plugins. Note: many possible plug-ins are shown here, but we don&#39;t need to build all these pieces to have a great system. The point is to have natural places to add in approaches that we know folks are currently using out there, in various kinds of languages. </p>

 summary : <p>This project aims to provide a simple Builder pattern and Factory pattern based approach to generating DML (Data Manipulation Language) SQL for all the popular RDBMS systems. Included builders are SelectBuilder, InsertBuilder, UpdateBuilder, DeleteBuilder. It is much lighter weight than any of the ORM tools available, and is 100% Java, no other special configuration language or query language to learn. This code has been in production use since its first incarnation around 2001. Also included is a Facade patterned Database object that wraps a Datasource object. This provides an execution framework for the results of the Builder objects which includes simplified transaction and batch management as well as the ability to transparently handle sql exceptions in a default manner. The Database object also provides a simple object oriented approach via wrappers around the database metadata.  </p>

<p>There are no DDL (Data Definition Language) builders. This library is aimed at creating runtime dynamic sql easy. The DDL for the different databases is so varied that trying to abstract it out to a single generation framework would be counter productive. There are no plans to address DDL any time in the future.  </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to Burmese conversation agent - an intelligent computer entity to communicate with Burmese, the people live in Myanmar, in their own native language. In Burmese Tar Tar Oo Lay means the lovely one who like to talk, hance this project aptly name TarTar. </p>

<p>TarTar is a a set of AIML contents providing basic functionality to communicate between Hunan and Computer. AIML, or Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, is an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents. The AIML was developed by Richard Wallace. It formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), which won the annual Loebner Prize Contest for Most Human Computer three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge Champion in 2004. The AIML specification can be found here. </p>

<p>TarTar, a set of AIML contents for Burmese language, can be applied to any AIML intreprators supporting 1.0.1 unicode AIML, (see TarTarBrain for detail) providing basic functionality to communicate between Human and Computer in Burmese langauge. </p>

<p>TarTar can be easily extensible just by adding domain knowledge AIML contents, since AIML is an XML-compliant language that&#39;s easy to learn and create one from scratch within minutes.  </p>

<p>UsageDownload on of your favorate AIML intreprater from AliceBot.Org and get it ready. Set TarTar AIML content to the intreprater. This is no more than copying to the appriorate folder in most intrepraters. Modify few personalization, such as bot name and bot master. ApplicationThe application of chat bot is growing rapidly in customer serving on the web sites. </p>

<p>We are also looking at MM-EN translation service, dictionary lookup service and some casual information service like Burmese calender and fortune telling in Burmese ways. </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to Tigus ProjectTigus Project aims implementing a complete test generation and evaluation system. This involves applications (components) for question management, test generation, test evaluation and results publishing. </p>

<p>In the initial iteration, this involved writing several components in various languages to manage test data in various forms. This meant having separate tools for processing questions, generating the tests and correcting the tests, without any common framework. In the last years, while using the solution in production (for hundreds of tests), several flows in the generation-execution-checking process were identified. </p>

<p>Based on the knowledge gathered in this period, a rewrite of the system was decided in order to consolidate the use of the available components. The system architecture was redesigned to allow components to be brought in our taken out as desired. Multiple architecture layers working with common interfaces allow exchanging components and morphing the system depending on requirements. </p>

 summary : <p>Our goal is to create an object oriented simulator using Gillespie&#39;s stochastic algorithm to model the behavior of genetic regulatory networks. </p>

<p>There are three major design challenges that we hope to meet with our code: </p>

<p>Extensibility </p>

<p>The dynamics of gene regulation are complex and not fully understood. Therefore we want to make it easy to alter the behavior of genes in our simulation without disrupting other parts of the code. This goal suggests using OOP. </p>

<p>Scalability </p>

<p>We hope to eventually scale our simulations to large numbers of genes and regulators. For this to be feasible, our program must be efficient in regards to both computer time and set up time. Simulating a network of large numbers of genes will obviously require that our algorithms are efficient. It will also require an straightforward way to set all the required parameters. </p>

<p>Simplicity </p>

<p>Related to the last point, we want our code to have a simple enough user interface that a non-programmer with a little instruction can design and run simulations. While we don&#39;t necessarily want to provide a GUI, we will use input files to set simulation parameters so that a user doesn&#39;t need to alter the source code and recompile in order to change the simulation. </p>

 summary : <p>Tysos is a 64-bit operating system written in C Sharp. The kernel is compiled ahead-of-time by tysila, the TYSos Intermediate Language Assembler into native machine code (currently position-independent x86_64 code packaged in an ELF-64 object file). Tysila itself will then also be compiled ahead-of-time by itself and the resultant object files linked together to produce an operating system that can just-in-time compile any other required modules or applications.</p>

<p>The resultant binary will be loaded by TLoad, a stage 2 bootloader in turn loaded by GRUB.</p>

<p>The base design of the operating system is a pre-emptive multitasking microkernel with all processes within the same (64-bit) address space. Memory-safety and protection against malicious code will be provided by Tysila.</p>

 title : The wow-get Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>wow-get is a tool that interacts with wow-index servers to install and update world of warcraft addons.</p>
 summary : <p>wrsd is a World of Warcraft realm monitoring daemon that serves individual realm status information. It is loosely based on the WWW::WoW::RealmStatus perl module. </p>

<p>Application Overviewwrsd is very simple. It consists of an Erlang application that supervises two children. </p>

<p>wrsd_realmserver -- This gen_server process maintains the status of given realms using gb_trees (general balanced trees). wrsd_yaws -- This module manages an embedded yaws server to provide a public XML interface. The wrsd_realm module is used to fetch and process realm data provided by http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/realmstatus/status.xml. </p>

<p>Quick StartBefore you compile the modules you&#39;ll have to make yaws configuration change to set the public interface to the correct hostname and port. In the wrsd_yaws.erl module change the &#39;port&#39; and &#39;servername&#39; of the SC1 variable in wrsd_yaws:set_conf/0. There are two SC variables set, one for localhost testing and another for your (potential) production host. </p>

<p>The application also assumes that the yaws ebin is in the code path. If you havn&#39;t set yaws in your $HOME/.erlang file do it with this: </p>

<p>echo &quot;code:add_path(\&quot;/usr/local/lib/yaws/ebin\&quot;).&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.erlangNow start an Erlang node, compile all of the modules and start the applications and its dependancies. </p>

<p>erl +A 1 +Ktrue -boot start_sasl +W w -sname wrsdapp -yaws embedded true -setcookie wrsdcookie
<br/>Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.5.5 [source] [64-bit] [async-threads:1] [kernel-poll:true]
<br/>....</p>

<p>wrsdapp@yournode)1&gt; make:all([load]), [application:start(X) || X Thanks to sasl you&#39;ll probably see a lot of output. Most of it can be ignored. As long as you don&#39;t see errors or application start failures you should be good to go. As per the update_loop start phase a process will spawn that will attempt to update the realm data every 10 minutes. </p>

<p>You can test the application by using the public www interface. Go to http://host:port/realm/Medivh.</p>

 title : The houdah-webobjects-frameworks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The frameworks make up a new major open source project to extend Apple&#39;s WebObjects application server. Granted the Houdah Frameworks can&#39;t compete in size with Project WONDER. Yet I am proud of what I achieved and believe I provide a viable alternative. </p>

<p>Most importantly though, you don&#39;t have to view Houdah Frameworks as competition to existing architecture like D2W or WONDER. You may view the Houdah Frameworks as a repository of utilities and useful code snippet which work with all WebObjects applications. Actually some of the code has been available for download on my personal web site for quite some time now. The custom qualifiers (InSubqueryQualifier, InSubSetQualifier, ...) have proven to be popular. You are bound to find many like code nuggets in the low level frameworks: HoudahFoundation, HoudahEOControl, HoudahEOAccess or HoudahAppServer. </p>

<p>Of course, there is much more to the Houdah Frameworks. Like the rule based validation system which will, of course, work with just about any WebObjects application. Or the rule engine, ... . </p>

<p>The real strength of the Houdah Frameworks is the web component architecture which builds up to a rule based CRUD framework. HoudahAgileComponents are meant as a modern alternative to D2W. The framework produces perfectly clean HTML which is to be &quot;skinned&quot; at the application level by CSS sheets.  HoudahAgileComponents is very flexible and allows for easy customization and extension through both rules and code. </p>

<p>The architecture builds upon HoudahViewComponents which provides the view layer. This layer provides large grain view components build from fine grained cells. The view layer could work with any control or persistence layer. The HoudahControlComponents implements a control layer focused on creating CRUD applications using EOF. The control components could be used as is: one would have to subclass an abstract controller for each &quot;page&quot; of the application. </p>

<p>HoudahAgileComponents extends the control components by concrete subclasses which call into a rule system. This makes Houdah Frameworks a powerhouse for both rapid prototyping as well as production applications. That said,  Houdah Frameworks are intended for use on in-house CRUD systems. If you were to create a public web site, you would need to work on optimization. </p>

<p>All throughout Houdah Frameworks MVC principles are taken to the extreme. Of course the EOControl layer does not depend on the EOAccess layer, the view layer does not depend on EOF and the control layer joins them. </p>

<p>BTW, I am pretty proud of the rule engine. It is based upon the same ideas as Apple&#39;s engine and retains file format compatibility.  It has the distinct advantage of depending only on the Foundation and EOControl layers. It may thus be used in code that&#39;s unrelated to the WebObjects presentation layer. I also believe that the caching algorithm is much superior to Apple&#39;s. </p>

<p>The bad news: What&#39;s missing is a sample application. I am still (slowly) working on that. Documentation can always use improvement. That&#39;s what the Google Code wiki is for. I plan to publish how-tos and documentation as time permits. I also hope for others to chime in on the wiki.</p>
 title : The lyricus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Lyricus is a minimalist lyric reader/editor for Mac OS X &quot;Leopard&quot; and later. I started developing in part out of boredom, but also in part because I was missing something small to read lyrics in.  Before Lyricus, I used Firefox, but with the lyrics in one tab, you have to switch back and forth a lot. I could have used a new, sized down window, but I wanted to practice Cocoa as well! </p>

<p>Update: Version 0.85 is out (November 30 2009). This is a minor release, with one major anti-feature: Lyricwiki support has been removed, due to legal trouble on their side. :-( The only other change from 0.83 is the added ability to customize the text and background colors. </p>

<p>See LyricusFeatures for a list of features. </p>

<p>Two old, but mostly relevant pictures (please note that the toolbar can be hidden): The main lyric window (0.70),  The preferences window (0.76) </p>

<p>The download is up for grabs (10.5+, Universal Binary). Please, please, please report all and any bugs and/or feature requests, either using the issue tracker on this site, or via email (serenity@exscape.org). I&#39;m the only dev, and I&#39;m also the QA team. ;) If you don&#39;t tell me about a problem, I may well never find it nor fix it! </p>

<p>BTW, note that it is, and will stay, Leopard and later only. Apple weren&#39;t lying when they said that there were many things for the programmers in Leopard. </p>

<p>SVN note: I&#39;ve previously relied on Xcode&#39;s snapshots feature to take backups in between svn commits, to make sure that the trunk always works. Well, not anymore, because that feature is bugged bigtime. The trunk may contain all kinds of stuff now, including features that will never make in into a release. Get the latest tag if you want to look at working source.</p>

<p>Next Meeting: Sunday, November 27th @ 6PMAbout our weapon We are creating a weapon that will do one of the three things when the other person is hit with it in addition to a short blurring effect: </p>

 title : The brui Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Brui: Bean Reflection User Interface1. OverviewStatus: Brainstorming </p>

<p>1.1. ObjectivesThe framework support the generation of (client side) user interfaces for Java. The framework should work for all objects that follow the Java Bean Specification (so-called Pojos – plain old Java objects). In particular, the framework should be able to build forms &quot;on the fly&quot; that can be used to visualize and edit sets of objects and individual objects. The framework should be customizable, as Cascading Style Sheets were to HTML, BRUI will be to Java Swing/SWT components. 1.2. AcknoledgementsThis idea was taken from the second part of an Object Oriented Software Engineering Course (159.707/407) at Massey University. Motivations for making this project was it seemed that the material could be extended beyond the scope of the assignment. Also, it just sounded really cool, and there isn&#39;t anything out there that does this already. The original idea was borrowed from Jens Deitrich. </p>

<p>2. ParticipationIf you want to be a part, just drop your name into the wiki somewhere. I&#39;ll see you and maybe we can talk. </p>

<p>2.1. RequirementsJ2EE (or JDKv6 with Swing classes, however you get at those javax.swing files) A Maven setup</p>
 summary : <p>ABOUT CLIENT-OBJECTS FRAMEWORKClient-Objects aims to become a collection of stable and well-organized Java libraries that help simplify the development Java client applications that extensively use JavaBeans technology. Namely, it provides means to dynamically (runtime) convert POJO classes into JavaBeans allowing the developers to use their POJO objects with binding frameworks, such as JGoodies, without the need to create JavaBeans manually. </p>

<p>If the information below looks too confusing, please try the tutorial here: http://code.google.com/p/client-objects/wiki/Tutorial </p>

<p>Assumptions About The Client-SideOne of the problems in developing Swing applications (and GUI applications in general) is binding your data object model to each other and to the GUI elements. There are excellent binding frameworks, like JGoodies Binding, and in the future Spring RCP Binding and JSR-295: Beans Binding, that are very helpful in solving this problem. These frameworks operate within JavaBeans standard - a framework that among other things describes how one could &quot;listen&quot; to the changes that occur in the objects that comply with the standard. The use of JavaBeans on the client-side makes sense and client-objects framework is not trying to change that. </p>

<p>Assumptions About The Server-SideThere are established practices in server-side coding. One of the biggest ones is the use of light-weight data objects, often called POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), along with persistence frameworks, such as Hibernate and EJB3, for data access and transfer. These practices are justified and are in wide use. Again, client-objects framework is not trying to change that either. </p>

<p>So Why Do We Need Client-Objects?Simply put, client-objects framework tries to make the above two approaches compatible. Why are they not compatible? Server-side objects - POJOs - are not JavaBeans and they cannot be used with a binding framework directly. You have to create JavaBeans objects first. Usually JavaBeans will repeat the properties of the POJOs and add property change support. If you manually write your JavaBeans you will have to update the code every time POJO interfaces change. It could also become a quite complex task when POJOs encapsulate other POJOs and contain indexed properties, e.g. arrays and collections. This is where the incompatibility is clearly seen. Client-Objects framework takes the responsibility of dynamically creating JavaBeans from the POJO instances. This is the major component of the framework. </p>

<p>The second major component of the framework will be a service wrapping library. Usually a service also originates on the server-side and &quot;talks&quot; in the POJO language (i.e. parameter types and return types contain POJOs and standard Java types). The library will allow the developer to &quot;wrap&quot; the services dynamically so that the POJO parameters and POJO return types become JavaBeans. </p>

<p>Our PrioritiesPerformance. We are focusing on the GUI applications, which must be responsive and have small memory footprint. Stability. There is nothing worse for the user than a crashing GUI app. There is nothing more annoying for the developer than a GUI app that crashes because of a 3rd party library. Size. Keep the framework size (the size of the jar files) as small as possible without sacrificing the above. Small dependencies. Keep 3rd party dependencies to the minimum. Currently we depend only on asm and cglib libraries and hope we will not have to introduce any more dependencies. Nobody likes GUI apps that need tens of megabytes of disk space. Modularity. Client-Objects framework will address several aspects of client-side programming. Separate different aspects and package them in different jar files. Clearly document the dependencies between the jars.</p>

 title : The disorder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DisOrder is a software jukebox designed for multi-user environments. It allows users to pick music tracks for play from a shared collection. When nobody has picked anything, it can play randomly picked tracks instead. </p>

<p>There are two main user interfaces: a web interface and a GTK+ client called Disobedience. The latter is somewhat more sophisticated but only runs on UNIX-like systems; however most features are supported by both interfaces. </p>

<p>Tracks can be selected either by navigating through the directory hierarchy or by fast word search. It&#39;s also possible to apply tags to tracks and search by tag. Once a track is playing it&#39;s possible to cancel it if someone doesn&#39;t like it, or to pause it. </p>

<p>Sound can be played via either the ALSA or OSS (/dev/audio) interfaces; via the Mac&#39;s native sound API; or broadcast/multicast over a LAN. </p>

<p>Natively, DisOrder supports MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC files. It&#39;s possible to add players for other file formats. </p>

 summary : <p>ProblemOur project will address the following problem: given an academic paper or any general textual query, find a researcher who would be best suited to talk to you about it (based on their previous research). For example, given a paper as a pdf file, we would like to know who in the UW Computer Science department would be best suited to review the paper. Or given a phrase &#39;probabilistic motion planning&#39;, who are the people to talk to in the top Computer Science departments in the US? </p>

<p>SolutionIn order to answer this question we will build a statistical profile for a list of researchers based on their published papers, and do a cosine similarity between the query and the profiles to find the best match. Our program will roughly consist of the following modules: </p>

<p>Obtain the data and do some basic processing </p>

<p>Given a web URL address of a person&#39;s web page, download all the publications of that person (in pdf format)  Convert the pdf file to a text file  Clean up the text: Appropriate text cleaning like tokenization, removing stop words, and maybe stemming can be done.  Repeat the above procedure for a list of web addresses of multiple researchers&#39; web pages (perhaps given in a file).  Build a bag-of-word statistical profile for each researcher  Given a string, pdf file or a text file as a query, transform it into appropriate format, calculate cosine similarity of the document to each of the profiles, and output a sorted list of best matches.  Consider other applications on the statistical profiles, such as clustering people doing similar work.</p>

 summary : <p>Components for building wire-based data-driven user interfaces in Flex. Yahoo! Pipes demonstrates a similar UI paradigm.</p>
 summary : <p>Flex on BSPThe Flex on BSP (FLOB) project represent a library of SAP BSP Extension Elements that generate Adobe Flex instead of the standard BSP Extension output of HTML and JavaScript. </p>

<p>They are designed to make it easy for existing BSP developers to render Adobe Flex User Interfaces without having any knowledge of ActionScript or MXML and to allow BSP developers to work entirely within the ABAP Workbench. </p>

<p>An empty, compiled SWF file is loaded into the Flash Player within the Browser. UI elements are then added to the framework via JavaScript and the Adobe Flex/AJAX bridge (FABridge). This allows for a simple interface relying only on JavaScript to manipulate the User Interface. To make the process even easier, these BSP Extensions encapsulate the JavaScript and map concepts to BSP friendly constructs. BSP Server Side Eventing and Data Binding are both supported even with the Flex User Interface Elements. </p>

<p>Also for all Input Enabled Flex UI elements, an HTML Document Form Field is also generated hidden to the user. On Server Side events, these form fields are populated with the current values in the Flex UI Elements; causing a post back to the server that looks exactly like an HTML Form. This makes the transition from HTML/JavaScript based UIs to Flex ones almost completely invisible to the developer. </p>

<p>Also included is an application (zbspext_flex) that is designed to showcase the abilities of the Adobe Flex Extensions of BSP and to provide code samples of many of the commonly used UI patterns.</p>

 title : The fluidity-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The fluidity project is two things: a set of Javascript libraries to make creating complex AJAX apps easier, and a Java based web framework designed to make it very easy to fetch and send data to complex AJAX sites.  </p>

<p>About the framework first: The web framework&#39;s goal is to make it very easy to create rich web applications built on top of a solid business tier.  Allowing the framework to work with existing business tiers and data sources is paramount. </p>

<p>The main design concerns for the web framework are: </p>

<p>Keep the framework simple straightforward and light.  It feels like you have to fight most frameworks to get things done.  It shouldn&#39;t have to be that way. No &quot;Magic&quot;.  No code generation, inversion of control, runtime &quot;enhancing&quot; of classes, aspects, XML based bindings of classes to interfaces, hacked-up classloaders, or any of that other all-too-common-in-Java-web-frameworks stuff.  If you want to introduce any of those patterns into your app, that&#39;s all fine and good, but your web framework shouldn&#39;t force your hand. Very little configuration.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I&#39;d much rather subclass an object and override a method than hunt through pages of documentation and obscure online forums trying to figure out why my XML based configuration items I just activated don&#39;t work.   Right now, all the required configuration is in the web.xml file. Simplified exception handling by using runtime exceptions.  Exceptions are exceptional, they should be for when something goes irreparably wrong. </p>

<p>The javascript libraries include: $N node builder : A prototype.js based node builder that uses DocumentFragment and has a preferable syntax to the built in prototype.js &quot;new Element()&quot; builder. </p>

<p>BasePager : A prototype.js based client side pager control that is easy to wire up to AJAX/JSON requests. </p>

<p>BasePagerTable : Extends BasePager to add support for doing tasks common to data table displays (sorting, etc). </p>

<p>The project is still in its early stages, and is not yet well documented, but I&#39;m working on it, and there is a lot in there to dig into, if you&#39;re the curious type.  All code is released under an Apache 2.0 license, so share freely. </p>

 title : The google-thingbrowser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Thing Browser is a framework for loosely coupled components -- eventually, distributed objects -- that can be intuitively and securely composed by end-users. The project covers: </p>

<p>An argument for object-oriented user interfaces to software components (and the corresponding end-user information model); A way for components to be accessible using the familiar Web browser user interface; and A plan to interoperate with &quot;plain&quot; HTTP resources, including HTML, both programmatically and in the user interface. Between them, these concepts have precedents in Squeak and other Smalltalks; Self; OpenDoc; Cyberdog; the OS/2  Workplace Shell; and Internet Explorer extensions using COM components. It is also similar to a project called FavaBeans developed by Ihab Awad and the NakedObjects platform. </p>

<p>To the extent that casual composition of components from the Internet is hampered mainly by security concerns, and composition by direct manipulation (e.g., drag and drop) maps very well to capability security, the Thing Browser project is largely about security. The Open Source Google Caja project intends to bring capability security to JavaScript, and we would like to start thinking about suitable UI models. </p>

<p>The Thing Browser work, taken to its logical conclusion, would either adopt or invent a highly improved component model for the Internet. Since we hope to have buy-in from multiple vendors on such a model, it makes sense to do our work in the open. </p>

<p>Eventually, the Thing Browser project will rely on Google Gears and Google Caja.</p>

<p>The result is that there is no generated code to maintain or override.  To build an application one need only create application controllers that implement your business logic, spec out your UI in xml, and off you go. </p>

<p>The core assembly runtime, and any dependencies are completely open-source and free for any use in accordance with the new BSD license.  An application built as a MarkupApplication need only include the dependencies (and Markup is built with Maven for ease of managing this sort of thing), and then ship the app.  A courtesy note that you&#39;re using Markup would be nice, but beyond the terms of BSD license is not strictly necessary.

 summary : <p>AbstractThis paper proposes an intuitive 3D user interface based on hand gestures, implemented with light sensitive cameras and reflective markers. User of the system can create and modify file, picture and video with hands. Tasks that are more complex can be done by using a programmable user interface. </p>

<p>IntroductionWith the advance in computer hardware and human-computer interface (HCI) field, user interface used in computer has changed a lot in the recent years. From punched card to keyboard, from text to graphic, from command to menu, computer users can complete their tasks more easily and naturally. However, most user interfaces we used nowadays still require the use of some unnatural device like keyboard. Extensive practice may be needed in order to interact with the computer fluently and effectively. For the elderly and young children, the unnatural interaction with computer and the metaphor feedback environment from it makes them afraid to begin learning. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, when we look at the home entertainment market, we will find an interesting increase in the coverage of age. More elderly and young children play electrical games, as touch screen, voice recognition and motion detection system is used by game consoles in home. These natural interaction methods proofed to be a huge succeed. It no doubt gives us the trend of future HCI development. </p>

<p>This proposal suggests an intuitive 3D user interface based on hand gestures. An inexpensive and easy-to-use motion capture system with light sensitive cameras and reflective markers will be implemented, for the purpose of recognizing hand gestures. The user will interact with the computer in a virtual environment with actions he would do as if in real life.</p>

 title : The myfaces-orchestra-goodies Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Apache MyFaces Orchestra aims to provide a simple way to combine a web-framework with a persistence layer. Typically, an Apache MyFaces Orchestra stack might combine JavaServer Faces, Spring and a JPA implementation like Toplink, Hibernate, etc. The underlying idea is to provide long persistence sessions to the web-developer - this is done by associating these sessions with a conversational context. </p>

<p>The Google space will be used to host non ASF compatible code, e.g. which depend on LGPL stuff. </p>

 title : The tupletester Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThe simplest bugs in a program are generally triggered by a single input parameter. The next simplest category of bugs consists of those dependent on interactions between pairs of parameters, which can be caught with all-pairs testing. Bugs involving interactions between three or more parameters are progressively less common, whilst at the same time being progressively more expensive to find by exhaustive testing, which has as its limit the exhaustive testing of all possible inputs.  </p>

<p>FeaturesThis tool is platform independent way of generating something close to the minimum number of testcases required to test features of a specified tuple size, (all-pairs, or all triples for example) .   </p>

<p>More information on the technique is available at http://www.pairwise.org</p>
 title : The usixml-model-management Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Software user interfaces have become more and more complex nowadays because of the industry competitiveness, which is impacted by the new expectations of users, who expect to save time, enjoy a comfortable interaction and a clear understanding. </p>

<p>The HCI (Human Computer Interaction) discipline became even more concerned about the increase of the user interaction complexity and has been working on models to formally represent all aspects involved on the user experience. Some models are already mature and make part of this project: Task Model (TM), Abstract User Interface (AUI), Concrete User Interface (CUI) and Domain Model (DM). </p>

<p>A XML-compliant markup language was created to describe those models in an easier way to persist, share and transform. This language is called USIXML (USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language). More information are available in the USIXML website: http://www.usixml.org. </p>

<p>The USIXML Model Management project is focused on managing the USIXML code produced in your organization, integrating the currently available tools, sharing the code with the team and providing additional services like transformation, generation and traceability.</p>

<p>Your task is to write a length unit calculator. The system has the following features: • The user can enter a distance in meters and the distance is converted into feet and displayed.1 • The user can enter a distance in feet and the distance is converted into meters and displayed. • The system has a graphical user interface based on an Swing (i.e., user interface components from the javax.swing package are used). I.e., the end user enters the distance in a text field, selects the input and the output scales from lists or drop down boxes, and the result is displayed in a label or (read-only) text field. • The application should run as standalone application using an executable jar file. • The system checks the input for integrity, and pops up a message dialog if problems are detected. This includes tests whether the arguments are illegal (e.g., strings not representing numbers have been entered) and whether input and output scale have been selected. • Test cases, the calculator class and the user interfaces should be in different packages... </p>

Contains Math, Graphics, Concurrency, Scripting, IO, Time, etc., libraries for FreeBASIC, and uses as little external libraries as possible, other than the FreeBASIC Extended Library when justified. </p>

<p>This library is updated whenever I work on a new project.  I use it for general purpose programming.  It&#39;s meant to store classes which I am likely to use in a future project, or find useful in the current one.  For example, when I program in OpenGL frequently, the library is likely to receive updates encapsulating the use of OpenGL.</p>

 summary : <p>An actionscript SVG renderer. Lets you manipulate and render SVGs in actionscript 3.0, Flash 10, and Flex 3.0+ at runtime. LGPL license. </p>

<p>The initial version was created by Charles Dietrich and based on Rob Lanphier&#39;s svg2swf, with the the path parser and normalizer a port of the Batik microsyntax parsers.  </p>

<p>The current version was developed and is maintained by Lucas Lorentz. This version support more SVGs, but there are still lots of features to add. If it doesn&#39;t work with some SVG, please post to Issues. </p>

<p>UPDATE 03/10/2010 </p>

<p>I redesigned the library into &quot;display objects&quot;. Some advantages: </p>

<p>They represents the SVG structure and have properties like SVG elements; When you change some property, the object is rendered again. With deferred rendering; They can be cloned into a new object; Better events; They are easier to add new features </p>

<p>I intend to add new features only to the new &quot;display objects&quot;. So, the SVGRenderer and SVGParser classes will be deprecated. </p>

 title : The digirobo01 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Background </p>

<p>&quot;Digi-Robo 01&quot; is a simple robot toy from a Japanese company Gakken. Robot movements are controlled by a simple program disc. This disc is actually a circle divided in 180 small sections. The color of two adjacent (inner and outer) sections (black and white) correspond to robot movement direction. If you read russian you can also read about it in my blog. Or just see the movie. </p>

<p>Inner and outer sections are both white correspond to robot movement straight ahead. Inner section is white and outer section is black turns robot left. Inner section is black and outer section is white turns robot right. Inner and outer sections are both black stops the robot. This software can be used to create and print program discs easily. </p>

<p>Steps 1-2-3 for easy robot programming. </p>

<p>Step 1. Setup your screen for easy programming.Circles on screen represent control points of robot movement. Each circle has a number written in it, this number is the number of steps (circle sections) that robot took to get to this point. First circle with no number in it is a start point. You can use the mouse to drag the start point to appropriate position on screen. If you select any other circle and drag it across the screen it will result in rotation of robot movement direction angle from the start point. Adjust your robot position and angle in a way to be able to fit the path you desire to design on your screen. </p>

<p>Step 2. Design robot path.Initially robot path as a straight line ahead is projected. Each circle is shown with dotted gray outline, this is because this is not the final robot path yet, only something that will happen if you choose to move robot into given direction from this point. We can call these circles as projected robot path. Also initially first circle of this projected path is marked as “selected”. You can see this because this circle has somewhat thicker outline. As you move the mouse along the projected path more circles get selected. First make sure the first circle (marked as 0.5) is selected. Right click on it. You will see a popup showing you the options to change robot direction from here. You can choose to move robot right, left, straight or stop. The last image you will see is how the program disc will look once you print it. If you choose next direction like this all circles before selected will become final circles of your robot path. You can change that later by unselecting them. Next part of the path will be projected in next direction you choose. If you select left or right the robot will make 360 turn, remaining steps permitting. Tangent ines will show however what direction will be taken if you will chose to stop turn during some stage of it and choose another direction after it. </p>

<p>Step 3. Print program disc.Use file menu to print program disc and check the resulting path with your real robot. You can also save and load program disc files easily. </p>

 summary : <p>Eyepatch is a rapid prototyping tool designed to simplify the process of developing computer vision applications. Eyepatch allows novice programmers to extract useful data from live video and stream that data to other rapid prototyping tools, such as Adobe Flash, d.tools, Processing, and Microsoft Visual Basic. Eyepatch has two basic modes: </p>

<p>A training mode, where users can train different types of classifiers to recognize the object, region, or parameter that they are interested in. A composition mode, where the classifiers are composed in various ways and users specify where the output of the classifiers should go. Eyepatch allows designers to create, test, and refine their own customized classifiers, without writing any specialized code. Its diversity of classification strategies makes it adaptable to a wide variety of applications, and the fluidity of its classifier training interface illustrates how interactive machine learning can allow designers to tailor a recognition algorithm to their application without any specialized knowledge of computer vision. </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionIf you don&#39;t know Actionscript (or don&#39;t like it) but you would like to play flash video on your site, you&#39;ll probably find Flivpee useful. All the player widgets use JavaScript and you will style them with CSS. The goal for Flivpee is rapid deployment for developers without Flash / Actionscript knowledge. I believe there to be a performance benefit as well, though I have no benchmarks to prove it. </p>

<p>Your users will need Flash 9. </p>

<p>News2008-08-12Version 0.8 has been released. I&#39;ve had this ready for a while but I thought it was my duty to provide an example of the new features. I&#39;ll have an example soon, but in the mean time you&#39;ll just have to trust me. New features: </p>

<p>Audio playback (mp3). RTMP playback for audio and video. I tested the RTMP playback with a service I subscribed to for the purpose, but I haven&#39;t yet tested it in a real world scenario. If you&#39;re going to use this and it doesn&#39;t work for you I would love to help. Contact me in the Google Group or e-mail me. </p>

<p>2008-02-09Version 0.7 has been released. This is a complete rewrite over the previous versions. If you installed the old version, you should consider upgrading. </p>

<p>2008-02-07I&#39;m preparing a new release, so you&#39;ll see aspects of this site change in the coming days as I update the different sections incrementally. If you&#39;re thinking of using Flivpee, please wait a little bit. This is necessary because the new release is a complete rewrite. </p>

<p>2007-09-08I&#39;m re-writing the player. I&#39;m going to take it off haXe because the Flex SDK is open and I think it&#39;d be easier to debug the JavaScript if I just hand-coded it all.</p>

 title : The headless-graph-viz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>So I am a Software Engineer that has taken an interest in the Eclipse community and their corresponding RCP framework. For our customers, RCP + SWT has provided a far better user experience than designing our same application around Java AWT/Swing. We&#39;re starting to provide an application that features network visualization. The problem I face is that all the Java graph/network visualization software we came across is written to use Swing/Java2D. As people who have developed with SWT may have experienced, sometimes bridging/integrating AWT components into SWT is not always an easy process. The more obvious issue is that you now have 2 different UI threads to manage, and the application can be more prone to deadlocks if you are not careful. A more problematic issue my team ran across is that the SWT_AWT bridge may not work perfectly on different Operating System and Windowing System combinations, Problem with SWT-popup-menu and Linux. Therefore, my team would like a visualization package that can use SWT natively. But, if we are to implement a successful visualization package, then we don&#39;t want to shoot ourselves in the foot if others what to use this software and wish to make Swing based applications. Therefore, my goal for this project is to make a visualization package that is abstracted enough so that developers can choose the GUI head to render; SWT, Swing, or perhaps other technologies such as AJAX or Adobe Flex. But, before I jump too far ahead, my first goal is to implement a basic visualization that can be rendered with SWT. Then, add the components that will allow rendering with Java2D/Swing. </p>

<p>I will also add that this project will start as a &quot;personal itch&quot; I need to scratch. Even if  my company doesn&#39;t choose to use my design, this project will start with the development of features that my team desires the most. Note that I am not attempting to refactor my favorite Java2D graph visualization software. If that were the only reason, then I would settle for the SWT_AWT bridge. I desire features such as spatial data structures to optimize the rendering performance, powerful &amp; flexible visual annotations, nested graphs, animation, etc. But, I have yet to find a good open source solution that incorporates all of the features I want.</p>

 summary : <p>jot-lib is a collection of C++ libraries developed at Brown University, Princeton University, and the University of Michigan from the mid-1990&#39;s to 2007, and used in support of research in 3D graphics. Various projects were published as papers, including &quot;Dynamic 2D Patterns for Shading 3D Scenes&quot; (SIGGRAPH 2007), &quot;Line drawings via abstracted shading&quot; (SIGGRAPH 2007), &quot;Free-form Sketch&quot; (SBIM 2007), &quot;Coherent Stylized Silhouettes&quot; (SIGGRAPH 2003), and &quot;WYSIWYG NPR&quot; (SIGGRAPH 2002). </p>

<p>As of late 2007 there are no active jot developers. We are releasing the source code is the hope that parts of it will be useful to 3D graphics developers. Recent focus in jot has been on GLSL shaders (which are easy to port to other systems) and sketch-based 3D modeling. </p>

The next release 0.4 will be able to handle vocabulary too.  The game is written in Java and uses the jMonkeyEngine. Currently, only Windows is supported. It is in an early stage. </p>

<p>You are in a maze (3D, first person view). You see some &#39;bots&#39; moving randomly through the maze, and every bot has a kanji (or letter, or flag etc) attached. In the lower left corner of your screen you can see a definition (or a question, a reading etc), and your task is to catch the related bot while avoiding the others. If you got the right one, it disappears, and you get the next definition. </p>

<p>One goal is to make the game as flexible and configurable as possible. It is easy to add new lessons and maps, and you can learn different kinds of content (unicode letters, vocabulary, graphics etc). </p>

 summary : <p>Abstract </p>

<p>Integration of collision and graphics layers at sub-entity level </p>

<p>Motivation </p>

<p>One of the most astonishing features shown in Crysis is the tight integration of the collision and graphics layers. This can be seen in the way plants bend when the character passes through them, or the sensation of a completely interactive world where everything can be touched, bent, broken, shot or utterly destroyed. There is a sense that any level of world subdivision (tree, branch, leaf) that is convenient for collision/physics modeling can be mapped into a convenient graphics structure realistically showing the results of that simulation. The implementation of how collision is mapped into renderable graphics in most current game technology makes it almost impossible to think of achieving such close interdependence between both layers, due to both performance and most importantly, the wrong design in the interface of both systems: the collision layer is a black box accessible only as one-piece entities, no matter how many geometries it contains; and typical scene graphs lack both the capability to dynamically tweak the inner hierarchical structure of a pre-defined graphical construct, except internally (purely graphic animation). This is why ragdoll-character integration is so difficult to achieve, and why something that looks as simple and obvious as colliding particles looks as such an advanced feature. </p>

<p>This project tries to prove wrong the idea that graphics and collision layers are only capable of interaction at the entity (global transform) level. I will develop a basic framework for both collision/physics simulation and graphics that allows both a physics-controlled structure arbitrarily map itself correctly into its graphics representation. This interaction can be applied at several levels: </p>

<p>· Map rigid-body physics to a rigid, hierarchical graphic transform </p>

<p>· Map hierarchical, joint-based collision structures to deformable, skinned meshes </p>

<p>· Map arbitrary damage or destruction effects into its graphic visualization: bending, bumping, crushing, breaking or plain blowing the object to smithereens. </p>

<p>· Map arbitrary deformation of a solid mesh into a graphic mesh at vertex level (eg. cloth animation) </p>

<p>· Map arbitrary fluid deformation and dynamics into a graphic fluid volume </p>

<p>With this project I plan to devise an alternate representation for hierarchical graphics, and a flexible interface for modifying the internals of such a structure, as well as the internals of defining a collision layer.</p>

 title : The osengine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>2D Scrolling Game EngineLe projet Old School Engine a pour but d&#39;offrir une solution pratique permettant d&#39;éditer ses propres jeux de plateforme 2D (très typés Super Mario World ©). </p>

<p>Grâce à un éditeur et à un moteur aussi généraliste que ce style de jeu le demande, vous pourrez intégrer vos propres graphismes, sons et vos règles de gestions (script lua). </p>

<p>Pourquoi avoir créé un moteur et un éditeur plutôt qu&#39;un jeu : </p>

<p>Dans la création d&#39;un jeu, la conception d&#39;un éditeur complet est primordiale. Cet éditeur doit permettre le plus de modifications post-compilatoires possibles, et surtout permettre à des non-développeurs de gérer les aspects &quot;non-critiques&quot; du jeu (comportement des ennemis, map). Dans la réalité tous les jeux commerciaux ont leur propre éditeur,  publiés ou non. Le fait de publier l&#39;éditeur donne l&#39;opportunité au joueur de modifier le contenu et grâce à internet, de faire partager son mod. Ce qui permet de prolonger la durée de vie du jeu (exemple spectaculaire de Counter Strike, mod d&#39;Half-Life). </p>

<p>Au terme de la programmation du moteur (voire en parallèle), un jeu sera développé grâce à l&#39;éditeur pour présenter ses performances.

But no one has hard numbers.The Performance Test Harness is a framework for automated performance comparisons, along with a suite of code fragments implementing common techniques. Some are compute-only tests, for instance measuring the speed difference of traversing an array randomly or linearly. Others are graphics-oriented tests, for instance measuring the change in fill rate due to different AA schemes. </p>

 summary : <p>January 12, 2008 at Plazes HQ in Berlin, GermanyPlazeCamp -- aka &quot;Plazes Developer Day&quot; -- was an opportunity for third-party developers to join the Plazes development team at Plazes HQ in Berlin for a day of learning, mashing-up, hacking, developing, questioning, and generally exploring the capabilities of the Plazes API.  </p>

<p>PlazeCamp was not a formal conference, but rather an open day for interested developers, designers, and people generally interested in Plazes and presence to come together in the same place to &quot;hack together.&quot;   </p>

<p>Now that the PlazeCamp physical event is over (see a wrap up of what happened here), this Google Code project can live on as a repository for information, code, and tips for using the Plazes API. </p>

 title : The sidelight Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Sidelight ProjectA lot of graphics websites are platform agnostic, teaching a lot of useful principles, but requiring the learner to figure out the platform specific details on their own. In an attempt to fill in the gaps, Sidelight is dedicated to making graphics programming simpler and more enjoyable for Mac developers. </p>

<p>TutorialsOpenGL Tutorials – An indispensable book for learning OpenGL is the OpenGL Programming Guide by Shreiner, Woo, Neider, and Davis. It is effective as both a learning guide and an API references, though there are other resources for the latter. Sidelight provides as series of tutorials based on the topics covered in this book. Mac OS X Tutorials - These tutorials go into depth on solving a specific problem in Mac OS X development. FrameworksFrameworks on Mac OS X are collections of executable code (in the form of dynamic libraries) and related header files and resources. System frameworks such as Cocoa.framework and OpenGL.framwork are located in /Library/Frameworks/ or /System/Library/Frameworks. Third party frameworks are typically included in the application bundle (e.g. in MyApplication.app/Contents/Frameworks). Hence, the frameworks are installed and uninstalled with the application bundle, without polluting the system frameworks directories. </p>

 title : The terrabrowser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryTerrabrowser is an internet browser for satellite photos and topographical maps which are obtained from the Microsoft Terra Server web site. The map data is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and therefore only covers the United States at this time (although expansion to other map servers may occur in the future). Although a GPS receiver is not required to enjoy Terrabrowser, using one opens up more extensive features such as bookmark transfer, tracklog and route display, and live tracking. Includes extensive bookmarking support, tracklog/route rendering, image cache, address search, region download, and many other features! </p>

<p>Terrabrowser features built in support for serial based Garmin GPS receivers, and also supports Magellan receivers when combined with the freeware program MacGPS Babel). Download waypoints from your GPS to display on the maps, edit them, upload new waypoints to your receiver. </p>

<p>Terrabrowser aims to be compatible with the rest of the GPS world, so it uses the XML based GPX file standard which allows easy exchange (file, copy/paste) with other GPS programs for Macintosh, Linux, Windows, etc. which support this format. The NMEA standard protocol is also supported which allows for a &quot;live tracking&quot; mode to display the user&#39;s realtime position on a satellite map (cached or not). </p>

 summary : <p>Pending for now!, </p>
 summary : <p>Google Finance includes a very nice, flexible chart of stock values and volume, allowing the user to quickly look at different date ranges and retrieve specific values.  Inspired by this, I coded a very similar graph/chart for a project.  I then decided to create an AS3 class for the chart so that I and others could quickly add it to any project with just a few lines of code for configuration.  The initial class was just over 200 lines, but with additional features the class has ballooned to over 850 lines of code. </p>

<p>For an online example, check out http://indiemaps.com/blog/2007/11/timeseriesgraph-now-with-flags/      This was one of my first AS3 projects, so there is likely room for optimization and recoding.  And of course, there&#39;s plenty of room for additional features and public methods. The time_series_graph is not a component, but rather one (1) .FLA file with some movie clips and two (2) .AS files with the charting and flagging code. </p>

 summary : <p>Filing BugsThe version of this game distributed on Market (0.7) is a year old, and we have a complete rewrite coming up soon.  Please only file bugs against the new version (2.0), of which extremely-alpha versions are available in the &#39;Downloads&#39; tab.  Bugs filed against the Market version of this app are fairly useless to us. </p>

<p>What is this Android App?This application allows Android users to play Infocom classics just as &#39;Zork&#39;, as well hundreds of newer text adventures written in the last ten years or so.  The package comes bundled with a few built-in games, but also allows you to load games from your sdcard. </p>

<p>Specifically, it implements a &#39;z-machine&#39;: a virtual machine designed in 1979 by Infocom for playing text adventures, which has been re-implemented on nearly every computer and PDA since then.  To learn more about the platform and all the games available, start by reading the wikipedia entry on Interactive Fiction. </p>

<p>Can I Help Write the App?To get involved with development, join the twisty-dev googlegroup and introduce yourself!  We&#39;re currently in the process of doing a massive rewrite of the game:  we&#39;re moving from a java-based interpreter (fairly slow) to a set of C-based interpreters running native ARM code (fairly fast, and compatible with a wider range of games.) </p>

<p>How Do I Get It?Download (the OLD version) directly to your Android device now (or get it from Android Market): </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The new extremely buggy 2.0 rewrite (not yet finished!) is available from the &#39;Downloads&#39; tab.</p>
 title : The uioe Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>we have moved to sourceforge!please visit http://uioe.sourceforge.netUnofficial IOE is a project that documents information about all the projects being developed at Institute of Engineering IOE, Pulchowk Campus (Nepal) as requirement for Engineering (Electronics/Computer) courses offered by IOE. </p>

<p>The Electronics &amp; Computer department officials do not maintain any digital archive of the projects that can be accessed online. They just store the project files (source codes and other project documents) in a computer that is used to demonstrate the project to the teachers. The result is that all the work done by previous batch of students is not accessible to students when they plan their projects (except 4th year MAJOR project whose printed copies are available in the library). </p>

<p>The aim of uioe@googlecode is to document all the projects being developed at IOE. All the documents (project proposal,mid-term report, final report, source code documents, etc) and the source code of the projects (if the team want to release it in public domain) will be made available through this website.</p>

<br/>              the first NES emulator for the Xbox 360 and XNA</p>

<p>The project page for this project is at:
<br/>	http://code.google.com/p/xnasharpnes/</p>

<p>The latest release can be downloaded from:
<br/>	http://code.google.com/p/xnasharpnes/downloads/list</p>

<p>You can get the latest source from our subversion repository at: 
<br/>	http://code.google.com/p/xnasharpnes/source</p>

<p>The development mailing list for the project is at:
<br/>	http://groups.google.com/group/xnasharpnes</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need to put your roms in the SharpNES360\bin\Xbox 360\Debug directory
<br/>and then run the emulator to deploy them to the xbox.</p>

<p>When the emulator runs it first pops up the prompt for storage devices, this
<br/>is so that it knows where to load and save your savegames.</p>

<p>It runs at 60% or 70% of normal speed while being debugged, but runs at full
<br/>speed when not running with a debugger on the 360.</p>

<p>This requires a creators club account which runs $99 a year or $49 for four
<br/>months.  You&#39;ll also need the free Visual C# Studio Express and the XNA bits.</p>

<p>To run on windows you&#39;ll need the Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 1.0:
<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2E136A1F-F187-478C-9DA5-AAEB0904782B&amp;displaylang=en
<br/>and may also need the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer:
<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en</p>

<p>Controls:
<br/>	A = A
<br/>	B = X or B
<br/>	Start = Start
<br/>	Select = Back
<br/>	Up, Down, Left, Right = D-Pad or Left Thumbstick</p>

<p>	* With the first controller:
<br/>		Return to Rom Menu = RB (Right Shoulder Button) + Back
<br/>		Exit Emu from Rom Menu = Back</p>

<p>Supported Mappers:
<br/>	Mappers 1 (mostly), 2, 3, 4 (mostly), 7 (partial), 9 (mostly), 10, 
<br/>	  11 (partial), 22 (partial), 34, 64 (partial), 66</p>

<p>What&#39;s Still Missing:
<br/>	Sound (Might I suggest humming along or retro game music from the 360)
<br/>	Full Mapper Support
<br/>	NES State Saving and Loading</p>

<p>A Note About Sound:
<br/>	Josh Dersch, author of DotNES (another NES emu written in C#,
<br/>	http://yahozna.dhs.org/projects/NES/index.html) has given us permission
<br/>	to use his sound rendering classes when he releases the source code.</p>

<p>	Unfortunatly, they won&#39;t do us any good.  The Audio API&#39;s in XNA do not
<br/>	allow for writing to sound buffers.  THIS MEANS THAT NO EMU OR MEDIA
<br/>	PLAYER CAN HAVE SOUND SUPPORT ON XNA IN ITS CURRENT STATE.  I&#39;ve talked
<br/>	with MS about this and they said it is not intentionally blocked but is
<br/>	just a side effect of using the XACT system.  It&#39;s something that they
<br/>	didn&#39;t get to, which is understandable considering how fast they built
<br/>	XNA for us.  Please feel free to complain loudly to xna@microsoft.com.</p>

 title : The aop-ood Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the example code used in my various presentations on improving application design by using dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming and object-oriented design. </p>

<p>It contains multiple versions of the same sample application - a really simple &quot;banking&quot; application - that is incrementally transformed from tangled mess of procedural code to a nice object-oriented POJO design that leverages aspects and dependency injection. </p>

<p>There are three sets of maven projects.  </p>

<p>The first group contains the example code for my rich domain model presentation. This code illustrates compares and contrasts a procedural design with one that uses a rich domain model. There are two projects: </p>

<p>procedural-banking - the procedural version domain-model-banking - the domain model version Both projects uses Spring and Hibernate. There are a couple of different versions of this presentation. The Spring One version from June 2007 is available as both slides and a video. The Spring Experience version from December 2007 has the slides and an audio recording. </p>

<p>The second set of maven projects contain the code for my presentation on simplifying code with dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming (Spring AOP) and Hibernate. There are the following projects: </p>

<p>v0-non-pojo-banking - uses programmatic transaction management/security/etc and singletons and statics for inter-component references  v1-non-pojo-banking-with-di - uses dependency injection for inter-component references v2-non-pojo-banking-with-di-aop - uses Spring AOP to handle transactions/security/etc v3-non-pojo-banking-with-di-aop-spring-txn - uses Spring&#39;s builtin transaction management aspect v4-non-pojo-banking-with-di-aop-spring-txn-jdbc - uses JDBC v5-non-pojo-banking-with-di-aop-spring-txn-hibernate - use Hibernates </p>

<p>These projects progressively illustrate how using dependency injection, AOP and Hibernate simplify the code. You can find the slides for February 2008 version of the presentation here. An earlier version of this presentation was also given at the Colorado Software Summit 2007. </p>

<p>Finally, there is also the spring-mvc-jpa-banking project. This version uses Spring 2.5 @MVC and JPA.</p>

 title : The baynoon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Baynoon is an object database server that understands and efficiently implements relationships (one to one, one to many and many to many) between entities using a simple query language. </p>

<p>Baynoon is written in object-oriented C++. Baynoon is also intended to be portable. Currently, it abstracts an object oriented threading API over pthread. </p>

<p>Baynoon is in an early stage of development, currently, the underlying engine is being written. Here&#39;s a brief list of the current engine features: </p>

<p>Constant row length tables, with variable-length columns being externally stored (one file per column). Row-level locking against writes. Writers block readers only in the row they are writing to. Integrated table partitioning. Table locking is performed per-partition in order to reduce thread synchronization overhead. Variable-length columns are only limited by the amount of data that can be carried in memory. In the future, support for VarCol streaming maybe added. Constant row length implies implicit &#39;id&#39; indexing, i.e an index does not need to be created for a quick look-up for a row with a certain id. Every Baynoon object implicitly has an &#39;id&#39; member variable. In addition, Baynoon&#39;s query language parser has neared the testing stage, Lemon was used for a parser generator, Flex was used for a tokenizer generator. </p>

<p>Everybody is welcome to join with ideas, suggestions or code submition (though you should read this first: BaynoonCodingConvention).</p>
 summary : <p>Our codebase has been moved to GithubSource code: http://github.com/xdev/blackbird Documentation: http://github.com/xdev/blackbird/wikis Blackbird is a fully customizable data management system built with the understanding that no two websites are the same, nor are their management needs. Instead of dictating a pre-defined schema for content storage, retrieval and manipulation (as most CMSs on the market do), Blackbird separates content, style and structure to adapt to any number of formats, front-facing interface(s), and any information/data architecture - be it an XHTML-based website, Flash site, XML/RSS, mobile content, custom API, or any needed technology. </p>

<p>ApproachBlackbird was developed out of the need for a flexible toolbox with room for more tools when necessary. At it&#39;s core, Blackbird includes the tools to handle most common tasks (handling ascii and binary assets, users and permissions, content relationships and data-mapping), and when a special tool is required for a particular custom function, it can be easily added (image manipulation, nonlinear folksonomies, etc.). The idea is that no single tool is meant to perform every task: sometimes you just need a screwdriver or hammer, other times you need a paint brush and full pigment oils. </p>

<p>FeaturesAttribute based categorization of content Flexible database schema to work with any information architecture Support for a combination of taxonomy and folksonomy systems Customizable standards-based XHTML/CSS user interface Ajax-enabled editing to enhance user experience and optimize workflow Object-oriented plug-in architecture for simple custom functionality Data mapping for cross-content relationships Advanced user permission system Comprehensive history log ExtensibilityWhile the core system&#39;s solid foundation is built to handle the common tasks of content storage and retrieval, Blackbird&#39;s object-oriented plugin architecture allows the core to seamlessly expand to handle any number of specific requirements. </p>

<p>Custom extensions built in the past include customizable reports, image manipulation, metadata filtering systems, custom user content management privileges, email campaign management, site navigation systems, media galleries, and many more. </p>

<p>LicensingBlackbird is open-source software freely available under the GNU General Public License v2. By default, any custom (client-specific) plugins are applied with the same license; however, arrangements can be made to provide full copyright protection for specific custom plugins to the client if necessary (additional fees may apply). </p>

<p>Our hope is that innovation would be a benefit to all, but respect that some investments are meant to benefit only the few. </p>

 title : The brainz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BrainzBrainz is a simple, no-frills, object-oriented PHP5 API for working with the MusicBrainz REST API. Future releases may include support for AudioScrobbler/Last.fm APIs and MusicDNS. </p>

<p>Developer DescriptionBrainz is a simple, no-frills, object-oriented PHP5 API for working with the MusicBrainz REST API. Brainz is fully object-oriented, has complete API documentation, and is developed by a commercial entity that uses frequently uses the API. This means that that there will be long-term continued maintenance. The API is fully documented, and support is provided primarily by users, for users. Read and contribute to the documentation wiki. Learn to love code comments, print_r()&#39;s, and var_dump()&#39;s. ;) </p>

<p>There will probably never be any official releases -- only stable SVN trunk builds. </p>

<p>Available Developer ResourcesBrainz was developed for the WarpShare project, then made available as an open source project. I&#39;m always open to patches, feature requests, and the like, but know that I&#39;m currently the only person working on this project. Because of that, the majority of my development efforts will only go to bugfixes and enhancements that will be valuable to me in building WarpShare. If you want to see a new feature integrated, or a particular bug fixed, make it as easy for me as possible. Generating a patch and sending it to me is always the preferred method as it&#39;s the easiest for me. </p>

<p>Welcome to the project! :) </p>

<p>RequirementsThis package utilizes specific PHP extensions and other open-source packages: SimpleXML (for handling XML responses) PEAR HTTP_Request, which in turn requires: PEAR (base package) PEAR Net_URL PEAR Net_Socket, which in turn requires: Various PHP stream_socket_ functions. Tarzan is Brainz&#39; sister project, and at the moment, Brainz is still utilizing Tarzan&#39;s Autoload functionality and HTTP Response class. Eventually, these two classes will be completely separate, but that&#39;s not a priority at the moment.</p>

<p>The library does not use much STL, although this may change in the future. STL is used internally in the neural network class, as well as in some of the list and array classes.</p>
 title : The crylib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>As a programmer, I personally hate editing stylesheets. Experimentation would be so much more fun if styles could be applied to GWT widgets using an object-oriented API. Goals of this API will be: 
<br/>- to allow programmatic control of styling of CSS widgets and a GWT application; for experimentation, tweaking, etc. 
<br/>- optional final step to instead export these programtically assigned styles as a generated stylesheet. 
<br/>- make it easier to work with styles using an API: one important reason: the style descriptions are different between JavaScript and in a stylesheet; e.g. font-weight vs. fontWeight. This is an annoying PITA. One API - define styles programatically/OO and with the ability to export as a stylesheet page as needed when deploying. 
<br/>- We need this API because technically GWT only encapsulated the JavaScript and HTML - but the programatic CSS handling is needed too.</p>

 summary : <p>The current performance assessment meta-model in the PYIK software has been tested on a very simple model with limited scope. The meta-model needs more verification by application of existing models on to the meta-model. The new improved version will therefore Select two different performance assessment techniques from the various existing techniques, and model them using the meta-model presented. (Note that this also requires research in the domainss of quality management, psychology, education and practical assessment methodologies. ) Prepare user interfaces and evaluation dashboards/scorecards for the performance assessment reports. These will include charts, gauges and some interactive components which require a decent amount of AJAX application development and a  degree of data modelling. (See http://www.dundas.com/Gallery/Gauge/RS/index.aspx?Img=Dashboard3 and http://www.netsuite.co.uk/portal/products/nsb/rtdashboard_l.shtml for the state of the art in dashboarding)  Conduct periodic and end of project performance reviews for the CTP210/CTE310 projects to see how the models work.</p>
 title : The ctp-210-p2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The cvphplib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutThis library started in the Summer of 2008 and is still in an early stage. </p>

<p>This library has two aims. Firstly, it bundles small and simple re-usable functions that I use regularly, such as functions to work on 2-dimensional arrays. Secondly, it features new solutions to more complex but common problems, that other libraries or frameworks did not solve in a way I was looking for. </p>

<p>Part of this library may depend on the Zend Framework. </p>

<p>This library uses simpletest for unit testing. </p>

<p>ComponentsOpen for trialThe following components are open for trial. </p>

<p>CV_OutputFilter (beta)forces the developer to escape output data, effectively preventing Cross Site Scripting caused by laziness. For more info read the examples, the unit tests and the Google Groups Thread </p>

<p>CV_Collection (alpha)A powerful collection class, based on SPL::ArrayObject. It is superior from simply using arrays for managing collections. Among other features, CV_Collection offers methods for sorting and filtering, similar to PHPLinq. </p>

<p>CV_Collection has a few significant advantages over PHPLinq. </p>

<p>A shorter, more readable interface. Names easier to learn for PHP developers. While PHPLinq reminds of SQL, CV_Collection widely re-uses the familar names of the standard php Array-functions. Security assistance. Both CV_Collection and PHPLinq use expressions provided as strings, for queries. This opens the serious danger of code injection. To assist in avoiding security vulnerabilities, CV_Collection provides support for binding variables, similar to what PDO allows for SQL-Queries. This way embedding potentially dangerous strings directly into the expression string can be avoided. CV_Collection can be used for collections of any kind of data. It however offers special convenience functions for collections of objects and database records. These include extracting a &quot;column&quot; from a database result set and using the database IDs as array keys. </p>

<p>CV_Collection offers a fluent interface aka. support for method chaining.  </p>

<p>CV_Filter_Input (stable)extends Zend_Filter_Input to allow proper handling of arrays, also submitted as a patch http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4354 </p>

<p>IncompleteThe following components exist in a very incomplete state in the code base. </p>

<p>CV_ORM (pre-alpha)an Object-relational mapping approach, that aims to solve some problems all competitors share. The recognized competitors are ezpdo, ezComponents, doctrine, propel, PEAR DB_DataObject. Some goals of this implementation: </p>

<p>easy out-of-the box functionality: include and run, no configuration needed (except for database login). Have ORM in place within 10 seconds. (Especially no huge XML configuration as in Propel) completely customizable model implementations (using code generation based on replaceable code templates), in order to allow conformity to any existing architecture be adaptable to the developers taste of style and architecture for models, in other words: use getters or public attributes or ArrayAccess or get set or whatever you like. It&#39;s up to you, you can adapt the implementation completely to what you like in a simple way. use your own custom class extension strategy, no forced base class as in doctrine and propel, no proxing object as in ezpdo direct access to objects related over several hops, not just one (one-to-many) or two (many-to-many) but through arbitrary relationship paths maximum re-use of data already in the database schema: your change your schema -&gt; your models change right away. retrieval and merging of the schemas from several sources: database, an array configuration format, your custom schema source. This allows to transparently add data not available in one source. Your database does not provide foreign key information? Or you want to change the name of the class member retrieving related objects? Just complement the missing data by additional configuration. This also allows to  tolerate database changes, no migration problems as in the other ORM frameworks DataMapper, not ActiveRecord, in other words separation of model and database logic </p>

<p>CV_Form (pre-alpha)aims to implement form handling in a way that is php-developer-friendly as well as web-designer-friendly. </p>

<p>PlannedPrototypes for the following components exist, but are not yet in shape to be put into the code base. </p>

<p>CV_ErrorHandler (planned)An error handling class that works with set_error_handler and set_exception_handler . It will offer the following features: </p>

<p>allows to specify include/exclude rules based on path and error code respects the @ operator to oppress error messages creates a snapshot of the variable state, when the error occurred for later analysis send E-Mails to a specified address accumulates several errors into 2 emails (2 not 1 for technical reasons) waits for a given time until it sends the next mail provides a GUI to analyze the variable state snapshops for a specific error   </p>

<p>CV_Controller (planned)A very light-weight controller class as in Model-View-Controller. </p>

<p>CV_View (planned)A very light-weight view class as in Model-View-Controller. The class makes use of CV_OutputFilter to provide convenient and secure views. </p>

<p>CV_TranslatorA class that assists in very easy to implement and yet very flexible localization. It provides support to be integrated into CV_View. </p>

<p>CV_Singleton / CV_Multiton (planned)Abstract classes to rapidly implement the Singleton or Multiton design patterns for new classes.</p>

 summary : <p>Edge2d Game Engine Edge2d version 0.1.0   Copyright © 2007-2008, Kevin Lynx. All rights reserved.  </p>

<p>OverviewEdge2d is a very object-oriented and plug-in-based 2d game engine. As a result of strict software design edge2d will be an easy extended, cross-platform and independent from any other 3rd libraries engine. 
<br/>  </p>

<p>Edge2d is absolutely plug-in-based. What plug-in-based here mean is that all the modules except the basic module of edge2d (also called abstract level) is plug-in enabled. For instance, you can develop your own graphics module to be an Edge2d plug-in and register it into Edge, and then Edge will work with your own graphics plug-in. </p>

<p>The original developer of Edge recommends users to develop their own plug-ins. That’s the main design purpose of Edge. That means you can develop your own plug-ins easily but not modify the Edge’s basic module. 
<br/>Edge2d is open-source. The original developer tries his hard to show his experience on OOP to every engine user. 
<br/>I don’t want anything, I only want to share my little experience on programming especially on Object-oriented programming. I hope you will enjoy this library from my deep bottom of hear.  
<br/>FeaturesStrict focus on 2d games, even if the graphics plug-in uses 3D low level API, you don’t need to know any 3D information. The core of Edge is designed to function-based, so it’s very flexible for you. But the helper library also provides an easy framework so that you can use the engine easily. What I really want is to provide convenient for you besides flexible. The engine is easily extended by its plug-in design. I will provide enough documents to teach you how to program yourself plug-ins. Edge2d is absolutely free. The graphics plug-in recommend the plug-in developer to use 3D low level API like Direct3D and OpenGL to develop graphics module. That means Edge2d will use 3D hardware to accelerate its rendering. ArchitectureThe release version of Edge2d includes three parts: Edge base, Edge helper and any kinds of plug-ins. 
<br/>The Edge base (also called abstract level) is mainly to provide your interface to use and some other basic functions like IO, log system and exceptions. 
<br/>The Edge helper includes some static library that has an easy framework, frame animation, resource management from xml and some other libraries taken from other library( like particle system in HGE) 
<br/>The plug-ins are many dynamic libraries in fact. These plug-ins implement the basis of Edge like Graphics, Image Codec, Input System, Sound System, IO reading from any kinds of compressed data files, Font, Operation System dependent modules etc.

The entire system is pluggable and extensible. By exchanging plugins, the database can morph from use in embedded applications to enterprise applications. </p>

<p>In the near future Ener-J will also implement the Java Data Objects (JDO) 2.0 specification. Ener-J also extends the ODMG and JDO APIs to resolve the vagueness and ambiguities present in both APIs. Other extensions provided by Ener-J allow for account authentication, privileges, transaction logging, auditing, and classes for more robust programming. An implementation of the EJB3/JPA API is also planned. </p>

 summary : <p>Estela is a Domain Specific Language for ML model implementation (and testing). It is an Object Oriented Language (but not Object Oriented Obsessed like Smalltalk). Estela&#39;s API is composed by two parts: small generic API (e.g. Generic types like Integer, Double, String, Date and Object) and a extensive ML API (e.g. Classes like DataSet, Classifier, ClassifierEvaluation, Instance, and so on). Besides that, the language offers declarative constructions for some tedious tasks, and of course, a good array  manipulation support.  </p>

<p>Estela is a dynamic (interpreted), strong typed, not fully Object Oriented language. A dynamic language is the best tool for experimental computing. They provide you with a simple way to load and unload data structures (e.g. Easily dynamic class loading).   </p>

<p>Estela Virtual Machine (VM) will run on top of a Java VM. No ML algorithm run in complexity time less than Ω(MN) in which M is the number of attributes (columns) and N is the number of records. The Estela Virtual Machine has lots of opportunities to explore parallelism (e.g. Threads running in a multi-core machine) processing and reduce complexity time to Ω(MN/p) in which p is the number of processor. Usage of threads and concurrent algorithms should be transparent to the user.</p>

 summary : <p>Why FLiOOPS?There are several programming languages not having native definitions for the whole set of Object-Oriented Programing structures (features). </p>

<p>This project&#39;s been created mainly to emulate those structures (features) not included in a wide range of object oriented languages (prioritized considering members&#39; free time and motivation). To achieve this goal, we will state a set of requirements to be imposed in order to enhance user&#39;s (programmers) source code and models. Also a minimal set of links, free articles and/or comments will be provided for the native features of selected languages. If previous free solutions are found for an specific feature and language, they will be either compared (may be re-implemented) considering suitable requirements or, if appropiate, referenced including hyperlinks to third party sites or by any other means. We discourage to include third party artifacts among project downloads. </p>

<p>We plan to provide the previously mentioned solutions and also simple usage examples and automated test artifacts (preferently </p>

<p>Unit-style tests...) in order to show the benefits offered to programmers, assure artifacts quality and ease users learning process. </p>

<p>As a consequence of member&#39;s coding efforts, some supporting libraries, code and/or utilities may be generated as well. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Por qué FLiOOPS?Existe un alto número de lenguaje de programación que no incluyen entre sus elementos sintácticos soporte para todas las estructuras de la Programación Orientada a Objetos (POO). </p>

<p>Este projecto ha sido concebido principalmente para emular las características que no están presentes en un amplio grupo de lenguajes con orientación a objetos (considerados de acuerdo al tiempo disponible y motivación de los miembros). Para lograr estos objetivos, se definen los requisitos a considerar para mejorar los modelos y código fuente que obtendrán los usuarios (programadores) al utilizar el código fuente y otros artefactos generados por el proyecto. También se pretende incluir un número mínimo de hipervínculos, artículos y/o comentarios acerca de los elementos que si están incluídos en estos lenguajes, para motivar la rápida comprensión de las potencialidades de la POO. </p>

<p>En los casos en que se hayan aportado anteriormente otras soluciones no privativas con objetivos afines, o bien se compararán (pudiendo aportarse nuevas soluciones) considerando los requisitos antes mencionados o de ser apropiado, se referenciarán mediante hipervínculos a los sitios apropiados u otro medio. Los miembros no deberán incluir entre los artefactos que ofrezca el proyecto otros de la autoría de terceras partes. </p>

<p>Las soluciones introducidas estarán disponibles junto con ejemplos simples de su uso y artefactos de prueba (preferentemente al estilo </p>

<p>Unit...). De esta manera se mostrarán las potencialidades de las soluciones, se asegurará la calidad del código propuesto y se acortará el tiempo de aprendizaje. </p>

<p>Como resultado del trabajo de los miembros también se obtendrán librerías, código y/o utilidades que darán soporte a la construcción de sistemas con especificaciones más formales. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FLiOOPS... Pour quoi?Aujourd&#39;hui ils sont nombreux les langages de programmation qui ne contiennent pas toutes les éléments définis pour ceux orientés objet. </p>

<p>On présente-ci le projet FOOPS, lequel a été créé pour émuler les caractéristiques qui ne sont pas définis par défaut en chaque langage de ce type (en les considerant selon le temps libre des mêmbres et leur motivation). Pour réussir ce but, on choisit les exigences qui doivent être imposées sur chaque caractéristique afin améliorer les modèles et le code que les utilisateurs (dans ce cas les programmeurs) obtiendront après utiliser toutes les composants que nous offrons. On désirerait aussi inclure assez de liens, articles, peut-être remarques, tous en rapport aux particularités vraiment définies par la syntaxe. </p>

<p>Dans les cas où on ait ailleurs apporté d&#39;autres solutions pas restreinte en ayant un but similaire, on essaiera soit de les comparer (en puvant apporter de nouvelles alternatives de résolution) en considérant les exigences déjà prevues, soit de les faire référence en présentant des liens aux pages où on puisse en savoir plus. Parmi les composants livrés par le projet on ne trouvera aucun dont les auteurs ne soyent pas de mêmbres du projet. </p>

<p>Les composants livrés par le projet seront acompagnés par exemples d&#39;utilisation et épreuves (préférablement celles du type </p>

<p>Unit...). Ainsi on assurera la qualité du code proposé et les programmeurs pourront voir leurs bienfaits, en les utilisant plus rapidement. </p>

<p>En conséquence on aura à la main aussi d&#39;autres composants et code d&#39;aide à spécifier les logiciels plus corrèctement.</p>

 summary : <p>Google Experimental Language #2 (GEL2) is an experimental general-purpose object-oriented programming language.  GEL2 is essentially a subset of C#, extended with an ownership-based type system which allows GEL2 to free memory safely and deterministically without using a garbage collector.</p>

<p>This implementation of GEL2 includes an interpreter and a compiler which generates C++ code.  The implementation is mostly intended as an experimental prototype intended to demonstrate the viability of a type system based on ownership.  The language is large enough to write useful programs, such as the GEL2 interpreter/compiler itself.</p>

<p>GEL2 originated as a research project I developed while working at Google.  I&#39;d like to thank Google for allowing me to release GEL2 as open source.</p>

 summary : <p>Giocondo allow you to easily create GUI applications that runs both on the web and standalone with the same code. </p>

<p>You only need to know PHP. No knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and AJAX is required, except for defining the static content of pages or changing the default style. </p>

<p>Giocondo follows the KISS principle and uses an object based (not full object oriented) API for constructing GUI by composition (a la Tcl). </p>

<p>Ancillary libraries provided are: </p>

<p>a database library which doesn&#39;t use any abstractions (e.g. relational to object mappings). You just code queries in an almost-standard SQL which is then parsed and converted to the specific implementation dialect automagically. At last the full power and simplicity of SQL are in your hands regardless of the RDBMS you have. a privilege system to check and grant privileges in your application without having to code a certain test twice. It allow fine grane control.</p>
 title : The gmegoal Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Generic Object-oriented Adapter Language (GOAL) is a Generic Modeling Environment (GME) paradigm for building applications in abstract and then generating C++ and Java code from the model. </p>

<p>The roadmap for GOAL currently includes four adapters that other DSMLs or paradigms may contain or have models inherit from: Module Adapter, Class Adapter, Code Adapter, and Conditions Adapter. Of these adapters, the last two will probably be the more interesting adapters for other DSMLs and paradigms. Module Adapter and Class Adapter are more standalone adapters for people constructing solutions with GOAL exclusively. </p>

<p>The core interpreter for GOAL will likely be written in C++ using either BON2 or the UDM framework.</p>
 title : The gnupool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>POOL is free software product, POOL is under development in WikiOcean, Pune, India. We call it as Pure Object Oriented Language.. </p>

<p>POOL is completely developed in JAVA programming language. For the GUI we used HTML, JSP, Servlet and Postgre SQL as Database. </p>

<p>This product is based on Object Oriented concepts for the data. The objects and its properties are stored as Master-PL. Each type of object is stored in Master and its properties in property Detail. </p>

<p>There are two ways of giving input to the system and taking output from the system. The first one is through SMS(short message service). There is a command format for adding, modifying, deleting and retrieving from database. It?s like a SMS Server. The receive thread reads incoming sms and forwards it to Control Module which after processing it generates response and passes it to sending thread. The other way of interacting with the project is through web. Every web page displayed is a webreport which uses one or more reports to display data. A webreport can contain other webreports in it. When each time a request comes by clicking a link or a button the incoming request parameters are passed to WebReportGenerator Module which depending upon request generates a string of html tags which is sent to client browser.</p>

<p>Object: Object is a living run-time entity .We can clearly understand what an object is by examining various objects .A cycle is an object .A Bike is an Object. Man is an Object and so on …let us see what made it as objects
<br/>&amp;nbsp;A Cycle has a name (attribute).A cycle has a chain (attribute) .A cycle contains pedals (attribute).we can use cycle for some functions like riding.(function). When we consider a man he will he will have a name(attribute),hands(attributes),legs(attribute)
<br/>Using his hands he will do some work (function)using his legs he will walk(function) and he has some more functions like running ,eating ,talking, sleeping, and so on(functions)…
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Man Object</p>

<p>Name
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Eyes
<br/>Hands	Legs
<br/>Walk()
<br/>Seeing()
<br/>Sleeping()
<br/>Eating()</p>

<p>So man cycle are Objects because they have some attributes and functions</p>

<p>Object= variables(attributes) +methods (functions)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Functions are called as methods in java</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>Therefore we can define an object as a runtime entity (which will be created in the program execution</p>

<p>Class: Before knowing about a class first you should be familiar with object, which I explained above. A class is proto type or blue print of an object
<br/>Which are mostly equals to structs and unions in C++ C languages, with little differences
<br/>Class defines the object. The definition of object is class
<br/>Consider the following code in  JAVA</p>

<p>class demo1
<br/>{
<br/>int var1;
<br/>String var2;
<br/>void method1()
<br/>{
<br/>//method 1 Code
<br/>}
<br/>void mathod2()
<br/>{
<br/>// method 2 code
<br/>}
<br/>}
<br/>here demo1 is class name ,var1,var2 are variables of type int and String(don’t be confused or temper you will come to all these in following sections) and  method1(),method2() are methods</p>

<p>Data Types:</p>

<p>In our daily life, we use many things for many purposes .we use calculators for calculations. we use *** for ***.and so on. Like that , we create objects for several purposes which are described according to class definition. Therefore, that object is data type of that class .java provides eights built in data types or simple data types, or primitive data types. They are

 title : The javascriptbase Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JSBaseJavascript Object Oriented Programming made easy </p>

<p>JSBase is based on the implementation of simple concepts, and the maximum use of the Javascript language strengths; creating a simple, clean, methodical and easily extensible development process to programming in an object oriented way in Javascript. </p>

<p>Main conceptsMembersAn object member is the generalization of properties and methods, so if we talk about an object member it could be a property or a method of that object. </p>

<p>Object PathJavascript implements objects as associatives arrays, so why don&#39;t we just exploit this   functionality ... </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at an example </p>

<p>var myObj = {
<br/>   member1: {
<br/>      submember11: &#39;submember11-Data&#39;,
<br/>      submember12: &#39;submember12-Data&#39;
<br/>   },
<br/>   member2: {
<br/>      submember21: &#39;submember21-Data&#39;,
<br/>      submember22: &#39;submember22-Data&#39;
<br/>   }
<br/>};If you want to assign a value to member1 in myObj, you have two ways </p>

<p>This one </p>

<p>myObj.member1 = {
<br/>   submember11: &#39;new-submember11-Data&#39;,
<br/>   submember12: &#39;new-submember12-Data&#39;
<br/>};Or This one </p>

<p>myObj[&#39;member1&#39;] = {
<br/>   submember11: &#39;new-submember11-Data&#39;,
<br/>   submember12: &#39;new-submember12-Data&#39;
<br/>};The second way provides us a dynamic member setting. In the example we used &#39;member1&#39; but we could have used &#39;member2&#39; or even &#39;member3&#39; and Javascript would have created the new member with the value passed. This use of the language provides a way to decide which member should be set at execution time providing an extremely powerful tool for programmers. </p>

<p>This is a great functionality, but it has just one problem; for each level we will have to write a pair of brackets containing the member name. </p>

<p>So, if we want to assign a value to submember11 at execution time we have to use </p>

<p>myObj[&#39;member1&#39;][&#39;submember11&#39;] = &#39;new-submember11-Data&#39;;If we take a closer look, we will notice that we have used two pairs of brackets; this makes it impossible to vary the number of levels dynamically. </p>

<p>Here is where JSBase comes to provide a solution. Let&#39;s take a look at an example </p>

<p>JSBase.setObjectPath.call(myObj, [&#39;member1&#39;, &#39;submember11&#39;], &#39;new-submember11-Data&#39;);&#39;submember11&#39; is an Object Path </p>

<p>Checking functionsIn most of cases, you have to do certain validation process to data before setting it. It could happen that some of your data could share some validation process with other data of the same class or perhaps another one, maybe the type checking, or something else not so obvious. For example you could have two classes and both of them have an email field, so the validation process for both fields would be the same. Apart from this, if you separate validation from the main implementation of the class, you are giving to the class a more tidy and cleaner definition, and also, you can reuse your validation functions in other classes. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s Imagine you have a class member like this </p>

<p>someMember: {
<br/>   someSubMemberOne: &#39;someValue&#39;,
<br/>   someSubMemberTwo: 0,
<br/>   someSubMemberThree: {
<br/>      someSubMemberThreeOne: &#39;someValue&#39;,
<br/>      someSubMemberThreeTwo: 1
<br/>   }
<br/>};Now, let&#39;s imagine the user wants to set &#39;someMember&#39;, so you will have to check the following things </p>

<p>The user pass you an object The object have all the mandatory submembers Each submember has the right type. For example in the case of &#39;someSubMemberThree&#39; you will have to check that the user pass you an object and then recursively check all the sub-submembers to acomplish the corresponding checking process. If you make all this validation process not in an orderer way, it could finished in a lot of program lines making things that are implemented in other places, or perhaps with a great amount of &quot;ifs&quot; and &quot;switchs&quot; that could be avoid. </p>

<p>JSBase provides the programmer a member checking process that could be easily molded to acomplish not only an easy checking process but a really big and recursively one, in a very orderer an easy way.</p>

 title : The jnwscript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project target is to provide a way to create nwscript from java code.  </p>

<p>I found myself very frustrated while playing with nwn toolset and trying to do some script. I was missing so much an Object Oriented language and a packaged code structure that I did not go further with nwn coding.  As I discovered the nwn2 toolset I get more frustrated when discovering the same script language and its crappy notepad . </p>

<p>So I decide to write a code generator engine to let me code nwn with object as it should be. </p>

<p>This is not a code wizard like lilac’s soul, but a framework that allow you program with Object and generate nwscript from your source. </p>

<p>Please note that the project is at is early start and is more a toy than a mighty tool. But it brings me some hope to have fun with the nwn2.</p>

 title : The kafeh2d Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kafeh2D is a simple and object-oriented 2-dimensional game engine for the Java Platform. The goal of the project is a reusable and high-level development framework for 2-dimensional game programming in Java or Java-compatible scripting languages (such as JavaScript, JRuby, Jython, and Groovy). </p>

<p>Kafeh2D also includes three other modules, the first called KafehTiled, a light-weight implementation of a Tile-based game, with planned support for 2D, isometric, and hexagonal tiles. The second is KafehNet, a light-weight and high-perfomance networking client module with TCP, UDP, and HTTP support. Finally, included is KafehServ, a dedicated game server base. </p>

<p>Additional tools called KafehTools are also planned, including a MapEditor, MapGenerator, and JavaScript-based PluginSystem.</p>
 title : The kipler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kipler is an object-oriented tableau framework for rapid development of (modalized) description logic reasoners.It also comes with readily implemented decision procedures for some of these logics. </p>

<p>A decision procedure for such a logic can be implemented by (programmatically) extending the classes provided by Kipler and thus making use of object-oriented programming techniques. It is not our aim to develop a general tableau definition language for these logics. </p>

<p>Kipler is under heavy development. Currently it supports SHIQ ABox reasoning and experimental SHOIQ reasoning. These logics are the underlying formalism of Web Ontology Language: OWL and thus are included in Kipler&#39;s profile to demonstrate its capabilities. These implementations also employ some optimization techniques, e.g., semantic branching and backjumping, to make them &quot;practical&quot;. The facilities provided by Kipler for optimizations can be extended to modal description logics as well. </p>

<p>The first alpha version is planned to be released when integration with an OWL parsing API is completed and more tests are done. </p>

<p>The name Kipler means &quot;modalities&quot; in Turkish.</p>

 title : The monocam Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>More recent C++ development: http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/ </p>

<p>Development status: this project has not been updated since 2008, a new C++ version is being planned...This project aims to create an open-source cross-platform program for calculating tool-paths for machine tools (eventually, something close to MasterCAM or SurfCAM). </p>

<p>Below we will have a blog-style list of screenshots as development progresses: </p>

<p>2008 Mar 20 </p>

<p>First tests with Drop-Cutter together with a kd-tree for finding which triangles are under the cutter. </p>

<p>2007 Aug 08Initial tests with Drop-Cutter. Surface-normal data needs to be re-calculated for some strange reason. Only 5% of drop-cutter calls are useful, need a kd-tree search to speed up algorithm. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>2007 July 27Rendering of STL files works: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>2007 JulyThe first milestone (July-August 2007) for this project is </p>

<p>Working OpenGL window with pan,rotate, and zoom (exists but needs work (proportional zooming/panning etc, perspective/ortho views)) STL surface loading (ascii exists and works) Raster-finish toolpath creation using DropCutter algorithm  G-code (post-processor needs to be written) </p>

<p>All of these components exist (sort of) by themselves so it should not take too long before we have our first rudimentary MonoCAM going!</p>

 summary : <p>What is OceanOS ?OceanOS is an Open Source project, to provide a new generation blogging platform, based on the concept of Resource Oriented Computing and featuring strong and weak modularization. </p>

<p>Component-based development is a common pattern in software development, but it is mostly used in a strong form of dependency. When you import a package or a library in your application, you are creating a strong dependency between your code and the imported functionality. </p>

<p>There are several examples in the Open Source world of weak modularization, but probably the most successful project is Eclipse. The Eclipse plugin architecture allows plugins to colaborate without knowing each other in advance. This provides increased flexibility and stability in a large complex systems. </p>

<p>Also, another problem with most popular ORM tools, that I find is the inability to use stored procedures and efficiently design  data. This solution is to allow that functionality. It&#39;s the best of both worlds, O/R Mapping and efficient data.</p>

 summary : <p>The Object Oriented Program Analyzer Program (OOPAP) has two primary goals: </p>

<p>Provide a basic system for User Fredericks to assess several quality metrics for the programs individual students. Design the system so that it can be extended based on User Fredericks’ experience. The OOPAP shall be a software tool to calculate metrics to help User Fredericks guide student programmers by determining the characteristics of the programs they develop.  For example: </p>

<p>LOC—a metric for the size of a program  Comments—a metric for the percent of comment or commented lines Class counts—a metric for the number of classes in a program Variable counts—a metric for the number of variables in a program, class … Therefore, these metrics may be of value to Software Engineers when they design programs and later when they seek to modify, extend, or improve them.  With the aid of these metrics, engineers and teams can identify components that are likely to have design problems and fix those problems.</p>

 title : The openspace-components Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Openspace is a web application and services framework that is based on object-oriented software engineering concepts. Applications are developed in Openspace via a browser-based graphical IDE. Developers focus on creating object classes, each with it&#39;s own set of attributes and methods. The collection of classes, the relationships between these classes and the possibility of creating persistencies by instantiating objects provides the tool for solution modeling. All development takes place in a dedicated realm, as managed by the developer/realm administrator. Users of the realms can use classes within the realm to organise, store, manage, contribute and share information to achieve the purpose of the realm. </p>

<p>In design pattern terms, Openspace is based around the Active Record pattern, named by Martin Fowler in his book &quot;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&quot;.</p>

 title : The pejs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PEJSPython Executed by JavaScriptThe project aims at implementing a Python VM in JavaScript, enabling Python on web pages in browsers all over the world :) </p>

<p>For now, this is done by executing Python Byte Code Instructions as outputted by the standard CPython implementation, but the perspectives are laid out by HotRuby, where nested Ruby code is run straight out of the HTML. </p>

<p>This project is sort of a Python equivalence to HotRuby. </p>

<p>School projectAt the moment, this is a school project as part of the course Design of Virtual Machines for Object Oriented Languages at DAIMI, the computer science department at University of Aarhus. The course is held by Lars Bak and his staff at Google Aarhus, the V8 team. </p>

<p>DetailsOur aim is to implement an object-oriented subset of Python bytecode. </p>

<p>Our approach is as follows: </p>

<p>We&#39;ve started by implementing a simple interpreter (src/interpreter.js) which simply switches over the bytecodes and implements only some very basic language constructs. The Python bytecode is actually generated by a Python program (tools/pejs.py) which outputs it in JavaScript arrays.The JavaScript file containing the bytecodes is then referenced in an HTML-file which also references our interpreter and thus the Python code is executed in the browser. </p>

<p>For a complete Python implementation we would have to write a Python compiler as well as the virtual machine we are doing. </p>

<p>Milestones</p>

<p>Week  Milestone  Details   44  Up and running  Simple interpreter operating on a stack   45  Basic constructs  Implemented jumps and loops   46  Object and Memory model  Decide on object representation and heap layout   47  Object and Memory model  Implement classes and objects   48  Garbage collector  Simple garbage collector if needed   49  Library calls  Handle calls to python library somehow   50  Performance evaluation  Report   51  Deadline  Report  </p>

<p>We aim to finish the basic language features (variables, conditionals, loops, functions) and then design and implement classes and objects which implies designing an object and a memory model. This is the most important part of the project. </p>

<p>After that, we would like to handle garbage collection as well as library calls. It is not yet clear how far we will get with regard to these two issues. That depends on how complex the object implementation turns out to be. </p>

<p>Finally we document our implementation with performance evaluations where we would like to consider different JavaScript VM&#39;s for executing our own VM as well as implementation alternatives inside our VM.</p>

 title : The permafrost Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WHAT IS PERMAFROSTPermafrost is a suite of tools motivated by the need of Java application developers for a transparent means of storing hierarchical/binary data. Permafrost plans to provide three key components for developing an application-specific data store: </p>

<p>libjhdf; a JNI binding for libhdf5. libjhdf has a simple Java-oriented API for working with the HDF5 native object structure library. It is NOT the HDF Group/NCSA Java HDF Interface (JHI). libjhdf is a ground-up project to develop a new JNI/Java library for HDF5 support. 
<br/>libjhdf is unique from other HDF wrappers in a number of ways: 
<br/>It is SWIG based We are using SWIG to generate the basic wrapper code. This leaves us free to work on other parts of the project and allows the possibility of producing wrappers for other languages later.       
<br/>It is a complete wrapper No other HDF wrapper we are familiar with exposes the complete HDF API. We use comparatively simple wrappers to expose the HDF C API rather than the object-oriented HDF C++ API. An object-oriented layer is implemented in pure Java on top of these wrappers. This has the advantage of giving the library a more Java-like feel.      
<br/>Error handling is done through Java exceptions We provide custom JNI for commonly used library callbacks, including the error handler.   No need to check return values. 
<br/>permafrost core; a Java persistence framework. The permafrost core is planned as an annotation-driven persistence framework designed to run on top of libjhdf. Classes are annotated to indicate which members are persistent and how data should be mapped to the HDF structure. No mapping metadata is stored in the HDF structure, so Java entity classes can be designed to map existing HDF data. Annotations are similar to EJB 3.0/JSR-220, but not identical. 
<br/>hoarfrost; a flexible HDF5 editor hoarfrost is planned to application developers to create and edit HDF5 data files. This mitigates the need to write custom importers for testing or one-off configuration data. It also is useful for viewing data when debugging HDF applications. 
<br/>STATUSYou may wish to check the News page for the most current status of the project. </p>

<p>LIBJHDFWe are currently implementing the SWIG Java wrapper for this component. HDF5 API documentation and unit tests will be ported at the same time. </p>

<p>CAVEAT EMPTORThis project is somewhat understaffed. As such, it will undergo periods where development work is slow/non-existent. However, we will do our best to document times when the project is idled and inform our users. In addition, we will always respond to support requests (at least with advice). This project will not become abandonware. </p>

 title : The persistantbunnies Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An Open Source Java Persistence Framework ProjectOverviewProject Status: Release Candidate. Project Frozen. </p>

<p>A 4th Year Object Oriented Software Engineering Project. The paper was provided by Massey University, Palmerston North campus, New Zealand. </p>

<p>The project is designed to provide an alternative persistancy framework API to help other programmers save Java objects to a Relational Database. Specific goals are to get an understanding of the mechanics, but basically it&#39;s for fun. </p>

<p>Expect the project to freeze from the 30th of May, 2008 because that&#39;s the deadline for this project (Unless any of the members feel passionate about keeping this thing running).   A better implementation (current etc.) would be Hibernate http://www.hibernate.org/. </p>

<p>ObjectivesCOMPLETED The framework support the mapping of objects to relational databases. i.e. add, remove and update objects, and find objects by id (primary key). COMPLETED The framework should work for all objects that follow the Java Bean Specification a.k.a. PLOJOs. COMPLETED The framework should work with any JDBC database. The API should be threaded. The framework should be able to generate database schemas (DDL). Technical DetailThis API uses Annotations to describe mappings to an RDBMS. Test cases use Hyper SQL databases, but it should work with any JDBC driver. </p>

<p>Dependencies:  </p>

<p>Java 6, or Greater (We use funky-awesome Annotations) Apache Commons Database Connection Pool (DBCP) API 1.2.2, or greater. Apache Log4j 1.2, or greater. HyperSQL (HSQLDB) 1.8, or greater. JUnit 3.8, or greater. An implementation of JDBC type 3 or 4.</p>

 title : The phpsavant Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Savant: The Simple, Elegant Template System for PHPSavant is a powerful but lightweight object-oriented template system for PHP. </p>

<p>Unlike other template systems, Savant by default does not compile your templates into PHP; instead, it uses PHP itself as its template language so you don&#39;t need to learn a new markup system. </p>

<p>Why Use Savant for Templates?You don&#39;t need to learn a new language or markup to create a template. The template language is PHP, and the template file is a regular PHP file. You don&#39;t have to worry about separate directories (or permissions on those directories) for compiled template sources, because Savant is not a compiling engine (the template scripts are already written in PHP). Even though Savant is not itself a compiling system, you can write your own compiler and plug it into Savant; this means you can use any template markup system you like. The Savant source code is easy to read, understand, and extend, because it is exceptionally well-commented. The object-oriented plugin, filter, error, and compiler classes for Savant are easy to use, understand, and extend. Because your template script is a regular PHP script, you can sprinkle it with comments and use phpDocumentor to document it.</p>

<p>Chapter 26 Java Projects</p>

<p>Object: Object is a living run-time entity .We can clearly understand what an object is by examining various objects .A cycle is an object .A Bike is an Object. Man is an Object and so on …let us see what made it as objects
<br/>&amp;nbsp;A Cycle has a name (attribute).A cycle has a chain (attribute) .A cycle contains pedals (attribute).we can use cycle for some functions like riding.(function). When we consider a man he will he will have a name(attribute),hands(attributes),legs(attribute)
<br/>Using his hands he will do some work (function)using his legs he will walk(function) and he has some more functions like running ,eating ,talking, sleeping, and so on(functions)…
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Man Object</p>

<p>Name
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Eyes
<br/>Hands	Legs
<br/>Walk()
<br/>Seeing()
<br/>Sleeping()
<br/>Eating()</p>

<p>So man cycle are Objects because they have some attributes and functions</p>

<p>Object= variables(attributes) +methods (functions)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;Functions are called as methods in java</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>Therefore we can define an object as a runtime entity (which will be created in the program execution</p>

<p>Class: Before knowing about a class first you should be familiar with object, which I explained above. A class is proto type or blue print of an object
<br/>Which are mostly equals to structs and unions in C++ C languages, with little differences
<br/>Class defines the object. The definition of object is class
<br/>Consider the following code in  JAVA</p>

<p>class demo1
<br/>{
<br/>int var1;
<br/>String var2;
<br/>void method1()
<br/>{
<br/>//method 1 Code
<br/>}
<br/>void mathod2()
<br/>{
<br/>// method 2 code
<br/>}
<br/>}
<br/>here demo1 is class name ,var1,var2 are variables of type int and String(don’t be confused or temper you will come to all these in following sections) and  method1(),method2() are methods</p>

<p>Data Types:</p>

<p>In our daily life, we use many things for many purposes .we use calculators for calculations. we use *** for ***.and so on. Like that , we create objects for several purposes which are described according to class definition. Therefore, that object is data type of that class .java provides eights built in data types or simple data types, or primitive data types. They are
<br/>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Primitive data types
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Numbers	Characters	Boolean
<br/>Integers		Floating points	char			boolean</p>

<p>byte short  int long 	float double</p>

 title : The shunde Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This framework allows you to rapidly create Models for your project.  Using SQL Server, it automatically creates tables and saves the data in an Object Oriented fashion. </p>

<p>This means you can create and use OOP without worrying about the incompatibilities of a relational database! </p>

<p>When used in ASP.NET applications, it contains many useful features, such as automatically creating user-input forms based on your model. </p>

<p>Provided as a Visual Studio 2005 solution.</p>
 summary : <p>The project is a simple extensible object-oriented JavaScript library for validating HTML forms on web pages. It differs from some other projects as it is fully extensible through an inheritance-like structure where custom validation routines can be created without having to modify the main validation class.</p>

<p>The core library consists of two classes; FormValidator and ValidateItem.</p>

<p>The FormValidator class is the main class which controls which form fields to validate and how to present the error message upon failure of validation.</p>

<p>The ValidationItem is an interface specifying how a certain type of validation should be implemented. The only requirement to implement the ValidationItem interface is to include a validate() function which must return a boolean value.</p>

<p>The validation library comes with a set of common ValidationItem classes for various type of validation such as e-mail addresses, URLs, IP addresses, and numbers.</p>

 title : The somenewlang Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In our oppinion, many of today&#39;s popular programming languages have their pitfalls.  We want to try to implement a contemporary, compiled language which allows static typing, at runtime (unlike C++), of object oriented code; in addition to a feature-ritch syntax, intuitive garbage collection, and many other improvments over C++.  We want to give portable, yet native, object oriented code, a clean slate to grow off of.  We plan to write our compiler and tools as a frontend to GCC in order to take advantage of it&#39;s ability to build code on a plethora of host systems with out the need for any of _our_ developers to port a thing.</p>
 summary : <p>Today&#39;s software packaging and distribuition is too system addicted than users&#39;s one.
<br/>We need a more object oriented vision into manipulation of software.
<br/>NextStep Bundles do it from the time being but with too much complexity inside.

 title : The springphp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Spring PHP emerged from my need for a true Web MVC framework that was deployable on a shared LAMP hosting environment.  After looking at many PHP frameworks, none seemed to fit the requirements: </p>

<p>PHP4 &amp; PHP5 Object Oriented - work with objects rather than global arrays and functions MVC2 design model - controllers push the model to views IoC Container - to eliminate implementation-specific dependencies between objects Light Weight Simple Installation - no complex deployment, no command line, no compilation No use of large-scale libraries like PEAR No templating language to learn - uses native PHP for views Completely flexible Easily portable to Java (Spring Framework) Broad compatibility - able to be deployed across many environments Performance - but not at the cost of flexibility Self-contained and configurable libraries for specific features No &quot;spaghetti code&quot; processing flow to understand Fosters, if not demands, clean, maintainable, and TESTABLE code Integrated logging for easier debugging Able to quickly integrate external libraries The goals of the Spring Framework for Java hold true for Spring PHP: </p>

<p>Make developing a complete webapp in PHP easier and LESS COMPLEX Promote good programming using best practices &amp; proven design patterns Reduce the need for &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; Make existing technologies easier to use Provide one consistent method for configuring the application Whenever possible, your application code should NOT depend upon SpringPHP APIs</p>

 summary : <p>Ajax Syntax HighlighterAjax Syntax Highlighter is a small Javascript utility designed to highlight code embed in a web page in a standard compliant way. It automatically looks for source code in the page, send it to a server-side highlighter and display the highlighted code. It also has a &quot;view as plain text&quot; feature and support internationalization. </p>

<p>Ajax Syntax Highlighter is built with Yahoo! UI and uses JSON for serialization. It is wrote by Kévin Dunglas. It currently includes GeSHi as server-side (PHP required) highlighter but it can be easily used with others such as Pygments. </p>

<p>See a demo. </p>

<p>InstallUnzip the archive or get Ajax Syntax Highlighter via Subversion. Put the resulting directory into your Apache document root with PHP enabled (for GeSHi). </p>

<p>Try to load http:////ajax-syntax-highlighter/test.html to check if your installation is correct. </p>

<p>In your HTML file add the following lines in the HEAD section to active Ajax Syntax Highlighter: </p>

<p>Is is also recommended to use the Yahoo! UI base, fonts and reset CSS files. Put before the previous lines: </p>

<p> 
<br/>Now add your snippets to your page like this: </p>

<p>&amp;lt;?php
<br/>echo &#39;Hello, World&#39;;
<br/>?&amp;gt;You must use the code tag with a class attribute following the HTML5 language- convention. You can add a pre tag if needed. </p>

<p>If you want to active an interface translation (here in French) edit ajax-syntax-highlighter.js and replace this.lang = &quot;en&quot; by this.lang = &quot;fr&quot; in the HighlighterConfig function. </p>

 summary : <p>Ajax.Tree lets you create super-versatile trees (visually hierarchical user interface) that can load content via Ajax, with the page load, or even add and remove any number of tree nodes directly through Javascript. The API separates styling, markup, user-interface and data very nicely, but does not get in the way. </p>

<p>The API uses a class factory so that a tree class supporting one set of nodes can be created independently of a tree class supporting a different set of nodes. Just define the properties of the nodes, build the data as a native Javascript object (JSON if using Ajax) and the tree class will build the nodes using your node type definitions! Expand/collapse is handled automatically as well as mouseover and mouseout bindings. Proper cleanup is performed, and easy to use hooks are provided for mashing up Ajax.Tree with your own project.</p>
 title : The splunk-ajax-sdk Open Source Project on Open Hub

<p>Splunk AJAX SDKSplunk&#39;s AJAX SDK is a public domain library providing Javascript development wrapper for projects based around Splunk&#39;s search engine.  </p>

<p>Please note this an early beta release of the SDK, and as such, hasn&#39;t been throughly tested.  If you find any bugs, or need assistance feel free to leave a comment on the Splunk Labs list, opening a ticket, or check out the code yourself and get busy!  Note: Don&#39;t email Splunk directly about support for this library - your requests will go unanswered if you do. </p>

<p>You can request to join the Splunk Labs project here on Google Code by emailing your Gmail email address in the SUBJECT line of your email to splunk-labs@splunk.com. </p>

<p>IntroductionSplunk AJAX SDK is a wrapper around Splunk&#39;s REST API, providing a model for the major functional components of the Splunk server. The following components are currently accessible via the SDK: </p>

<p>Authentication Search </p>

<p>We continue to work on implementing the wrappers for the other components of the server, including user roles and permissions. </p>

<p>There are many levels of possible Splunk integration, so we provided developers the ability to communicate with the Platform API - from raw http streaming to custom-tailored objects and SQL-style components. </p>

<p>RequirementsTo run the Splunk AJAX SDK Library you will need the Java runtime library installed: </p>

<p>Jquery  - http://jquery.com </p>

<p>Installation  Splunk AJAX SDK is a js module. Make sure that you have downloaded: </p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE - Check out this project too: http://code.google.com/p/as3-commoncode/ </p>

<p>Keep in mind this project is mainly for projects with just &quot;Pure Actionscript&quot; at heart, this project would need some modifications to work within the &quot;Adobe Flex Framework.&quot; It&#39;s setup more for a project with the IDE and .fla files. </p>

<p>For the most part this project implements the Model, View, Controller - a Design Pattern that is scalable for most projects using an OOP process. It&#39;s a basic MVC structure with a method to apply, with assistance from the Preloader and Application classes. It&#39;s also very handy for productive workflow; as a good practice you can setup your model logic and application logic first once your data is ready. Then it&#39;s just a matter of displaying and controlling the representation of that model. So if needed, more than one developer can work on an application. Each developer can work on different views or components or states of the overall view. Without depending on controllers or other views, each view just has to listen for what it wants to from the model. </p>

<p>Preloader </p>

<p>The Preloader for the Application class best practice is to extend this class for your own preloader class and then add the frame command to your own application class which is extended from org.simplemvc.core.Application. Look at the example flash application directory for further explanation. </p>

<p>Application </p>

<p>This is the specific class that starts an application. It adds all the necessary views and sets the model up. This is where you will pass to the model what data to use and you will also pass the model to all the views in their own constructors. </p>

<p>Model </p>

<p>The Model component of the MVC design pattern handles and stores the data and application logic for the interface. It is recommended that the Model utilize a push only dispatching protocol in which it dispatches information to it&#39;s listeners through the event object. This happens without any knowledge of who or what is listening. It is recommended that this class is sub classed in order to communicate and manage application logic, however you can use it directly as well. </p>

<p>View </p>

<p>The View component of the MVC design pattern is a distinct representation of a Model&#39;s data and or logic. A view listens too and represents changes to the model for states of the application or logic. It is recommended that the views in an MVC system be unaware of the inner workings of the system&#39;s Model (ie. utilize a push only dispatching protocol in which the Model pushes information to it&#39;s listeners through the event object). It is the responsibility of each view to make sure it has a controller. The controller can either be passed in to the constructor or it will be automatically made by the view&#39;s. To create an MVC relationship; a model is created and a view is created which is then added as a listener of its associated model. The view primarily creates its own controller, but can use an existing one, this is not recommended. It will be necessary to extend this View class and the core controller method in order to make more specific view objects for specific view/controller pairings. </p>

<p>Controller </p>

<p>The Controller component of the MVC design pattern responds to user inputs by modifying the Model. A controller listens too its view for user inputs. If the data submitted by the view, affect the data and logic, it will report that information up to the model. Otherwise it should act directly back upon it&#39;s view ( i.e. onRollOver ). A Controller has a direct relationship with its view and the model the View represents. A Controller is generally only created by a View that will accept user input, and in some cases the View won&#39;t have the need for a Controller. If a view does not accept user input, and the default controller method is called, a null controller will be returned.</p>

This will allow me to focus on documentation, examples, and tests for the most viable part of this silly idea and actually, just maybe, get something useful out there. As for the rest of it, let&#39;s just say it was never meant to be. </p>

<p>The CSS engine has seen a lot of progress, including full shorthand property support, HSL/RGB color handling, selector improvements, @import loading, and bug fixes. I&#39;ll get something put up on a separate project page within the next couple of weeks. </p>

<p>If anybody has use for any of this stuff, please contact me and let me know (john at newgonzo dot com). Just telling me a little about your project can be a huge motivator. </p>

<p>Cannonball is an implementation of the DOM Level 3, HTML and CSS3 core specifications written in ActionScript 3.0.  </p>

<p>Cannonball as a whole is not functional, but some of its components are usable as separate libraries: </p>

<p>CSS: The CSS engine in com.newgonzo.cannonball.css.* Scripting: JavaScript/ActionScript/ECMAScript scripting support with as3scriptinglib DOM: The DOM implementation in com.newgonzo.cannonball.dom.* (needs work) The CSS package is the most complete and provides: </p>

 summary : <p>This project provides support for variable size records (aka dynamic row format) in MySQL Heap (Memory) Engine. </p>

<p>Contributed under GPL2 by eBay, Inc April 2008 </p>

<p>As of March 2008, MySQL Heap Engine of any version is limited to fixed row format. It allocates fixed memory size for each record stored in a given Heap Table. For example, if table A has a VARCHAR(4000) column, MySQL will use at least 4000 bytes (plus other columns and per-record overhead) for every record regardless of whether it has that much user data. In this example, the table will use 4GB memory per 1M records. </p>

<p>Assuming that actual data in a VARCHAR varies (average data length is less than maximum), it would be best if Heap Engine could optimize its memory use. In the example above, if average VARCHAR data was 1000 bytes, the memory consumption would be 1GB rather than 4GB. </p>

<p>This project changes memory allocation mechanisms used by the MySQL Heap Engine. Each Heap Table uses separate area of memory for its own private use. When inserting new records, previous versions of MySQL would always allocate areas of &quot;reclength&quot; size. Reclength equals to maximum space that could be ever needed by one record in a given table. </p>

<p>The new approach adds a &quot;create table&quot; option to set chunk sizes. When inserting a new record, Heap Engine will analyze actual record data and calculate the number of &quot;chunks&quot; needed for a compact form of that record. It will then allocate the necessary chunks, link them together into a chunkset and store data in these chunks. </p>

<p>Variable size records provide &quot;dynamic&quot; row format, as opposed to &quot;fixed&quot; row format. For backwards compatibility, Heap Tables default to fixed row format. The project&#39;s scope is Heap (aka Memory) Engine/Table only, MyISAM and other engines do not have similar limitations. </p>

<p>For added flexibility, project introduces new HP_DATASPACE construct to MySQL Heap Engine, which should greatly simplify future BLOB support. Essentially, all BLOB&#39;s in a table would share their own HP_DATASPACE instance. Unfortunately, the author of this project did not have time to add BLOB implementation. </p>

<p>All the interesting technical details are provided in a big comment section in the beginning of hp_dspace.c, which documents design. The same information has been copied to the project&#39;s Wiki. </p>

<p>This project has been implemented by Igor Chernyshev of eBay Kernel Team. </p>

<p>UPDATE (July 30, 2008): Larry Zhou from Google and author of this project have contributed a few bug fixes. The diff and zip files have been updated accordingly. Original diff can be found in &quot;Deprecated&quot; downloads. </p>

 title : The mysql-killquery Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Note, this project was formerly known as &#39;check_mysql&#39; - the name has been changed to avoid conflict with the (more accurately named) Nagios plugin used to check MySQL&#39;s status.. </p>

<p>A sort of extension to MySQL&#39;s long query log, the script runs as a daemon with a continuous connection to MySQL, watching the list of running queries via SHOW PROCESSLIST. It enforces a timeout for queries - if a query runs too long, it is killed and a report, including the query and EXPLAIN output, is emailed to someone. </p>

<p>It does this using a continuous connection to the MySQL server. Periodic SHOW PROCESSLIST commands provide a list of running queries and how long they&#39;ve been running for. The KILL command is used to kill off queries that run longer than the timeout. </p>

<p>The script sets a configurable timeout, 60 seconds by default. If a query runs past the timeout, it is killed and a report is emailed out. The report includes the query and EXPLAIN output to use in debugging or optimizing the query. </p>

<p>Its probably not something you&#39;d want to use on a production system, but it is very useful during development and testing phases.</p>

 title : The mysql-log-filter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PurposeThe script filters the MySQL Slow Query Log to show queries which impacted performance most and is intended to be used by DB admins and application developers. </p>

<p>The log file is analyzed and processed as a stream, line after line, so there is no need to load the whole log file into memory. </p>

<p>--no-duplicates is a very useful option to see only necessary statistics. </p>

<p>--incremental remembers last input file positions and statistics in a SQLite 3 database, so periodical executions on the same files run much faster. </p>

<p>The Python version is usually 3-5 times faster than the PHP5 version. </p>

<p>You are welcome to contribute a version translated into your favorite scripting language, just open a feature request under Issues i.e. to add a Perl version. </p>

<p>Usage Examples# Filter slow queries executed for at least 3 seconds not from root, remove duplicates,
<br/># apply execution count as first sorting value and save first 10 unique queries to file.
<br/># In addition, remember last input file position and statistics.
<br/>php mysql_filter_slow_log.php -T=3 -eu=root --no-duplicates --sort-execution-count --top=10 --incremental linux-slow.log &gt; mysql-slow-queries.log</p>

<p># Start permanent filtering of all slow queries from now on: at least 3 seconds or examining 10000 rows, exclude users root and test
<br/>tail -f -n 0 linux-slow.log | python mysql_filter_slow_log.py -T=3 -R=10000 -eu=root -eu=test &amp;
<br/># (-n 0 outputs only lines generated after start of tail)</p>

<p># Stop permanent filtering
<br/>kill `ps auxww | grep &#39;tail -f -n 0 linux-slow.log&#39; | egrep -v grep | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;`Filter Options-T=min_query_time

 summary : <p>The way this tool will work is similar to any MySQL client. It will connect to the MySQL server and allow the user to create, delete, and update databases and tables, make queries and issue commands recognized by MySQL and the user will receive the output.  The main difference is that every command issued will be recorded in a serialized log, using MySQL Proxy; if more than one instance of the tool is open, it will record the commands from each instance within the same log as to simulate a concurrent connection. When the user has issued all the commands for inclusion in the test case they can use the tool to read the log, insert the necessary mysqltest commands, and output a .test and a .result file. </p>

 summary : <p>OwebPHP is a self-contained website development kit (Web SDK) which allows you to run AMP-based (Apache/PHP/MySQL) pages and services from Windows with little or no configuration. </p>

<p>1. Unzip OwebPHP-20081211.zip to C: </p>

<p>2. Run C:\Start.cmd (double-click in Windows Explorer) </p>

<p>3. Visit http://localhost:1979/ </p>

<p>Really, that&#39;s it!  You can start putting files into the ./website/ directory or edit ./conf/httpd.conf to change the port to something else. </p>

<p>Stop the server by running Stop.cmd (see Issue #1 for notes on this). </p>

<p>PhilosophyI intend this to be a template for all new PHP/SQL projects, something that I can maintain centrally.  The whole thing is small enough to include with any enlistment and doesn&#39;t require any services to be installed; so you can keep your desktop/gaming machine nice and clean when you&#39;re not working on your web projects. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is not intended to be a production-quality package, but merely something which allows you to run and develop PHP websites locally, swiftly, and easily. </p>

<p>MySQLOwebPHP as of revision 6 comes with both the MySQL server (daemon) and the PHP modules to utilize it.  Since this runs as a separate service, you&#39;ll have to run an additional program to make the database available. </p>

<p>To start MySQL run ./mysql/MySQL-Start.cmd. To stop MySQL gracefully run ./mysql/MySQL-Stop.cmd, or just close the window (warning: this will probably cause database corruption). </p>

<p>Default information: </p>

<p>Port: 11979 (not the default of 3306) Database: mysql User: root Password: none (blank/empty) Host: localhost:11979 User Tables are unmodified from the distribution.  This means that while you can connect as root with no password, it only works when you are doing this on your local machine. </p>

<p>Restore a Dump by running the following from a command prompt: mysql --port=11979 -u root mysql &lt; filename.sql.  Change filename.sql to the name of the dump file you&#39;re importing. </p>

 summary : <p>The default MySQL client is nice, but I wanted to add some features to it, like command aliases.  I also wanted to be able to be in my normal shell and quickly grab stuff from a MySQL table without switching terminals.  So, I wrote a couple extensions to the psh (Perl Shell). </p>

<p>Two new commands are &quot;dls&quot; and &quot;dhead&quot;.  dls lists all the tables in the current database, but feels like a &quot;ls -ltr&quot; in that it sorts them by last-modified time and shows the sizes.  &quot;dhead&quot; just peeks at the top 10 records of a table, and it compresses long fields when possible so that it can try to fit on a page. </p>

<p>The basic idea here is to develop a web-based integrated development environment for the Java programming language that would provide all the basic tools of a classic IDE, and then provide a plug-in architecture to extend that platform to support more features. Much like how the Eclipse framework made a mark in the desktop IDE segment, this IDE will be the first, one-of-a-kind application that will kick start the web-based IDE segment. </p>

<p>Background </p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself programming on a machine that does not have a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or even the Java Development Kit (JDK) and with hundreds of megabytes to download? It is often extremely inconvenient! Since the new generation of smart phones and PDAs that support AJAX and Java, plus many desktop tools that are supposed to be only run on our local disk drives have been put on the web and achieve huge success, e.g. Google Doc, it makes sense to take advantage of the B/S structure and keep the hundreds of megabytes of IDE and JDK on the server side. Moreover, it offers opportunities for live collaboration with other team members on open-source projects. </p>

<p>Goals </p>

<p>Provide a web site with these components:  •	A simple source code editor with intelligent syntax highlighting •	The code editor uses technologies similar to Google Suggest  •	A build-automation tool so that debugging can be done on the fly  •	The IDE will also include calls that will provide for compilation and/or execution of programs •	A solid framework that includes a well-designed plug-in architecture for a web-based IDE •	A plug-in to the framework that will allow for development of projects that use the Java programming language (for testing the above component) •	… project management, task management etc. </p>

<p>Project Details </p>

<p>The environment will consist of a number of the most useful features that are currently provided by applications such as Eclipse. Firstly, a simple source code editor with intelligent syntax highlighting. Secondly, using technologies similar to Google Suggest, we can introduce a notion of auto completion by letting the user know which methods and variables are in range based on the current context and certain trigger characters. Finally, we build a build-automation tool so that debugging can be done on the fly. Once the code has been produced, the compiled class files can be executed on the client side/server side.  </p>

<p>This project does not intend to reinvent the wheel. On the server side, we can interact with an existing open source IDE such as Eclipse through writing a plug-in that is able to make use of some of the well documented modules. I believe that this project could result in a highly useful tool and change the general perspective on what an IDE should be.  </p>

<p>Background Needed </p>

<p>AJAX, GWT (Google Web Toolkit), web programming, database experience, an idea of what makes a good Java IDE</p>

By expansion it is meant changes in the number of domain instances for each domain type. Different domain families might have significantly different constraints imposed by their fold that could explain these differences. This project aims to understand what properties determine these differences focusing in particular on peptide binding domains. Examples of constraints to explore include average cost of production or capacity to generate binding diversity for the domain family. </p>

<p>This project is also a test for using Google Code as a research project management system for open science. Wiki pages will be used to collect previous research and milestone discoveries during the project development and to write the final manuscript towards the end of the project. Issue tracking system can be used to organize the required project tasks and assign them to participants. The file repository can hold the datasets and code used to derive any result. </p>

<p>This project is open to anyone interested in the subject that would be interested in contributing. Have a look at the wiki and pending issues and send an email to pedrobeltrao@gmail.com with the type of analysis/literature research that you would be interested in contributing with.  </p>

 title : The dshistory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What It IsdsHistory is a small, cross-browser JavaScript library that can be used in web applications to handle the browser&#39;s back and forward button events. As the back and forward events are raised, functions that the developer had previously pushed onto the internal function stack within the library are executed. </p>

<p>Take a look at the demo. I encourage you to check out what makes it different from other browser history managers. </p>

<p>Is It Stable?dsHistory is currently in beta and has not yet reached version 1.0. The first release occurred in April of 2007. That said, the code is functioning in production without problems on a number of different sites. </p>

<p>It should be noted that, in the case of all browser history managers, the term &quot;stable&quot; is used loosely. Browser history managers are based on a number of different oddities (euphemism for hacks) in each browser. Even though dsHistory only supports four different browsers, the number of complexities are already very high, and thus even the most basic functionality takes a great deal of effort to achieve. Increased complexity is always directly proportional to increased failure. </p>

<p>Where (Else) Can I Get Help?If you&#39;ve already ready the Usage wiki and you&#39;ve taken a look at the Examples wiki, you can post in the dsHistory-discuss Google Group. If you still can&#39;t figure it out, I&#39;m more than happy to help where and when I can. You can email me at amattie-attt-gmail-dottt-com. </p>

<p>Getting UpdatesI&#39;ll be posting information about major releases on my blog. I&#39;ll post new downloads and other project-specific updates on the dsHistory Project Updates blog. Otherwise, you can check back here for updates. </p>

 title : The erlang-t-build Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WelcomeAs presented on Wednesday 27 February 2008 at the Erlang London User Group meeting at the offices of Skills Matter, 1 Sekforde Street, London UK. </p>

<p>http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/erlang-london/message/15 </p>

<p>&quot;The T-Build system simplifies and automates the creation of new Erlang/OTP projects, automates the build and packaging process, and automates the deployment of software onto the target systems. The T-Build system will assist any developers who have discovered Erlang, and are now prepared to use it for industrial purposes. It fills the gap between learning the language and deploying it.&quot; </p>

<p>RamblingsThere&#39;s also a podcast of my rambling talk advertised on the SkillsMatter website. I recommend a visit there, the other podcasts are far more interesting than mine! </p>

<p>In case SkillsMatter decide that there are far more interesting talks to advertise, considering the calibre and stature of the other speakers who can blame them, the direct link to Google Video </p>

<p>My fifteen minutes of fame, not! </p>

<p>BlogI&#39;ve half-heartedly started a related blog to accompany this project. </p>

<p>Similar ProjectsA different approach to project creation can be found at Erlware. The Erlware philosophy is different, and aims to be a far more dynamic development model than T-Build aims to be. I&#39;ve met Martin and Eric, and these guys are hard working individuals who have put a lot of love, care and attention into Erlware. Check it out, and say I said &quot;Hi!&quot; </p>

<p>RequirementsYou will need: </p>

<p>Subversion, but I expect other version control systems can replace this hard-coded dependency on svn the very latest GNU make, otherwise make will break under the stress bash sed Erlang OTP, any version will do. </p>

<p>DownloadT-Build is laid out differently to the traditional style of Subversion repositories, and following the instructions on the Source Checkout page will result in a big fat nothing. Sorry, but I haven&#39;t yet found how to change the Google default message. </p>

<p>If you Browse the source you will see three top level directories: </p>

<p>Applications Projects Tools </p>

<p>To begin you may have to register yourself as a project member, since committing projects to the repository require this. Without membership, you will create a project, but some files will not have the correct permissions (yes, this is a bug). This is fixed in revision r13 and later. </p>

<p>Checkout the top level non-recursively, then inside the project checkout Projects/, again non-recursively: </p>

<p>~$ svn checkout -N https://erlang-t-build.googlecode.com/svn/ erlang-t-build --username phmander
<br/>Authentication realm:  Google Code Subversion Repository
<br/>Password for &#39;phmander&#39;:

<br/>Template
<br/>Template-2.0
<br/>update-OTP-versionsThere should be a create-new-project-2.0 script available for action. Have a look at CreateNewProject for instructions. </p>

<p>StatusRevision 13 and laterThe version committed to Googlecode as of 2008-August-21 (from revision 13 onwards) tracks changes made since Friday 2008-March-07 inside T-Mobile during the course of day to day development. </p>

<p>One &quot;feature&quot; has been removed: it is no longer necessary to commit the newly created projects to enable them to build. Projects will build immediately after being created. </p>

<p>Another benefit added is that the scripts and created projects work on Apple Mac OS X, in addition to Linux and Solaris. </p>

<p>Up to revision 12The version committed to Googlecode as of 2008-Feb-29 (up to revision 12) is not optimised for use over the Internet. Running the Create New Project script will be ve-e-ery slo-o-ow. T-Build as used in T-Mobile is executed on a repository on a fast local network, and pushing T-Build onto Googlecode has revealed how painfully dependent it is on a fast network. Apologies for this &#39;feature&#39;. I plan to find ways of improving matters, possibly with a repository cache, or simply better algorithms. </p>

 title : The flagstaff Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FlagstaffGovernment&#39;s New Best Friend on the Web.Federal, state, and local governments have done a poor job of keeping up with the times.  In an age of communication powered by global electronic networks, accessibility to public information is becoming less of a luxury and more of a requirement.  The U.S. federal government has taken great pains in attempting to put a huge amount of public information online to make it accessible to the general populous, most notably through the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39; site (http://bls.gov), and yet information overload - making too much data accessible online without highlighting the most relevant information for the average citizen - has emerged as a new problem. </p>

<p>Flagstaff addresses these problems by packaging together a set of robust tools that are easy for any human being to deploy, use, and understand.  Presentation is key to producing a product that is both easy to leverage and learn from.   </p>

<p>Flagstaff is:Turn-key web presence specifically designed from the start for townships, municipalities, and other organizations focused on providing transparent communications with the general public. Accountability features, including update blogs, gantt charts, public task tracking, and calendars. Simple, sensible, and potent document management. Financial/budget visualization tools for quickly discovering &quot;where the dollars go.&quot; Content management for pages, information, and people profiles. Mobility features for access to information on the go from smart devices.</p>

 summary : <p>PurposeAs I find I have rewritten nearly identical code for many projects, I figure it is time to put them into a repository and keep improving them instead of rewriting them. </p>

<p>RoadmapGeneric Utilities, Advanced Tagging, a clean, stable source repository and more. This project is composed of sub-projects ranging from mundane to (hopefully) groundbreaking: but all should be useful to a variety of developers on all kinds of projects. See the SubProjects page for more information. </p>

<p>The primary goal of this project is to provide an application to interpret metrics data in assisting tech leads to provide detailed high level project information to upper management.  The primary portion of this project includes a web application that provides project leads with the ability to generate emails containing metrics data reflecting the projects which they own.  The application differs from the traditional email alert function in that the data it presents is encapsulated and presented in HTML format instead of traditional text. </p>

 summary : <p>People always thought of a method of sharing details Project Management, Collaborative Writing and Efficient Document Sharing and I found out XWIKI as a great choice for document sharing. Normally as software developers we mostly involve in team work. To become a good team all the members should carry the responsibilities and everybody should communicate efficiently. The communication will reduce the duplication of work and increase the efficiency of a team work and increase the responsiveness to changes. </p>

<p>XWIKI can play a key role in communication and sharing documentation. XWIKI has capabilities of online presentations that will make the life of the user easy to understand there work. Event calendar can have the schedules of the activity of the projects explaining milestones deliverables and deadlines. Adding RSS feeds will provides the recent changes to RSS readers. </p>

<p>Most software developers hate to do documentation. Using XWIKI developer can document the work and publish it easily. More importantly if this can be done on your favorite IDE then that will ease this task more. Most of our developers prefer to work using Eclipse as it has quite a lot of plugins. So developing a plugin for Eclipse that can edit XWiki pages directly from the IDE will be a great choice for a developer to share the details progress of work done regarding the assigned task. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this plugin is to provide the following basic features as requested by the XWIKI. By using the plugin the user will be able to edit, save, rename, delete, and add comments. I will also like to add the advanced features of grabbing a wiki site locally so that one can work offline. Since most of the JAVA developers uses Eclipse as there favorite IDE and if XWIKI and Eclipse can get tide with this plugin that will increase the usage of XWIKI also. The increasing number of users of XWIKI will strengthen the community around it and help to improve with new features.</p>

<p>Arguably, the most gruesome problem with project management systems is getting people to actually use it on a regular basis. The MiJob philosophy is that the user should feel like he is really using a tool that makes things easier and clearer, not a tool where at best, he doesn&#39;t screw up. MiJob is supposed to be person-friendly, in the way that if you create a project in MiJob (which everyone can do), no one else has access to it unless you specifically give them the access. That is a typical design principle in MiJob; cutting the user a great deal of slack.</p>

 summary : <p>A free GTD (Getting Things Done) application for mobile phones (Series 60)MobileGTD turns your Series 60 phone into a GTD notebook on steroids </p>

<p>NEWSIRC ChannelWe have an IRC channel now! It&#39;s called #mobilegtd (irc.freenode.net). Come over and be productive ;) </p>

<p>MobileGTD be sexy!I am currently thinking about giving MobileGTD a new flash lite based user interface. I have done a major rework on the back-end, so new features will be easier to implement here. But we also need a nice UI for all of this! David Allen said something like: Buy the yourself a really good pencil then you will be more likely to write things down with it. And MobileGTD definitely needs work on this end. </p>

<p>Get involved!I challenge all users of MobileGTD to think about how a nice UI for MobileGTD would look like. Send me whatever comes to your mind in the form of sketches, pictures, mockups. Maybe someone even knows some flash lite? I am really looking forward to seeing your ideas!! </p>

<p>What are the features?Based on a simple file and directory structure (easy synchronization with PC) Use your favourite file explorer to browse your actions Usable as a simple inbox, allowing you to create projects on the fly Searchable project list view Project editing functionality (add/remove actions/infos) Processing functionality (automatically find done actions) Review assistance (find projects with no active next action and projects that have not changed for a certain time) Compatible to GTDFiles Show me something!Ok, have a look at the brand new screencastScreencast </p>

<p>Or some screenshotsClick on the images to see the original Flickr page with explanations. </p>

<p>The project list view </p>

<p>The project details view </p>

<p>Creating a new action </p>

<p>How does it work?MobileGTD uses simple text files for projects. Each line in a project file can be either an action or an info. When adding an action to a project, a new line is added to the project file and a file is created in  a directory structure corresponding to your contexts.  If you e.g. create an action &quot;Computer Download new version of MobileGTD&quot; MobileGTD will create a file &quot;Download new version of MobileGTD.act&quot; in a directory called &quot;Computer/&quot;. You can also use nested contexts, e.g. &quot;Computer/Online/&quot; to further structur your contexts. To avoid too much typing you can define abbreviations for contexts, you could e.g. define &quot;26&quot; to be expanded to &quot;Computer/Online/&quot;. </p>

<p>You can then use any file explorer to browse through your actions and delete done ones.  When processing projects MobileGTD automatically searches for deleted actions and sets them to done in the project file. </p>

<p>How do I install and use it?For installation instructions see Installation. For an explanation of how to use MobileGTD I am planning to make a video, but I&#39;m not sure when I will have the time... </p>

<p>SummaryIf this sounds rather complicated, fear not!  It&#39;s dead simple! All you have to do is use the graphical interface to create and manage your projects and any file explorer to browse through the actions and delete the ones you have done. </p>

<p>DonateIf you like MobileGTD and it helps you in Getting Things Done you may also consider making a donation. This is a motivational thing, so don&#39;t ruin yourself financially ;)</p>

<p>The latest version of addonpkg (2008-09-07) is only lightly tested. The major change after 2008-07-05 is the removal files.wowace.com support since it is no longer updated. Their official client is at: http://www.curse.com/client/ and they are working on a Mac version. Addonpkg can still be used to fetch addons from SVN and GIT servers by editting the database file or providing the -svn or -git command line options.</p>

<p>The idea of bringing together people wishing to share an idea or project came to me over several projects organized spontaneously. Indeed, the methodology of project management often requires a readiness to see even a certain motivation or adherence to the principles of the project. To find rare and specialized skills we intend to create a project management tool with a collaborative system of exchange of know-how. The service contract any association that represents technical and human could be done tomorrow through a collaborative interface in real time. In order to pool returns experiences around the information available will enhance the management and realization of all human and technical projects.</p>

 summary : <p>The economic crisis that has affected all the countries severely has created much of a storm in the IT sector. Almost all companies have taken drastic measures to cut costs as a result of which many people have lost their jobs. But outsourcing is one such area that hasn’t seen much of an impact, as it helps companies to reduce much operational cost. </p>

<p>This puts the QA test management team under a lot of pressure as they have to finish the projects on time. The result of which is that the quality starts to get affected.

 title : The patternnotes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PatternNotes provides Java annotations for design patterns and coding idioms. </p>

<p>These annotations are valuable for concisely expressing a developer&#39;s intentions. For example, suppose that you are maintaining a project and you encounter code like this: </p>

<p>public class Foo {
<br/>    ...</p>

<p>    private Foo() {}</p>

<p>    private static final class FooHolder {
<br/>        public static final Foo INSTANCE = new Foo();
<br/>        private FooHolder() {}
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    public static Foo getInstance() {
<br/>        return FooHolder.INSTANCE;
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    ...
<br/>}You might wonder about the purpose of the nested class. You may recognize Foo as a singleton, but the nested class gives you pause. Maybe the nested class seems extraneous at first glance, but the original writer probably had some good reason for putting it there. You certainly don&#39;t want to break anything, so it would be valuable to understand what the original author was thinking. Maybe this is some &quot;special&quot; form of singleton that you&#39;ve not seen previously. </p>

<p>Now look at this annotated version: </p>

<p>@Singleton
<br/>public class Foo {
<br/>    ...</p>

<p>    private Foo() {}</p>

<p>    @LazyInitializationHolder
<br/>    private static final class FooHolder {
<br/>        public static final Foo INSTANCE = new Foo();
<br/>        private FooHolder() {}
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    public static Foo getInstance() {
<br/>        return FooHolder.INSTANCE;
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    ...
<br/>}Now you are sure that Foo is intended to be a singleton, as you suspected. Also, there is an annotation on the nested class. You jump to the source code of the annotation and read the annotation&#39;s Javadoc to learn that the technique is discussed in the popular Java books &quot;Effective Java&quot; and &quot;Java Concurrency in Practice&quot; and on blogs. </p>

<p>You consult these references and learn about the synchronization issues involved. Confident in the knowledge that you understand the situation, you make your changes while retaining existing functionality. </p>

<p>http://pixelbugs.wordpress.com</p>
 summary : <p>The first goal of the Project Management Web Application is to be highly user friendly. The application will leverage the rich client technologies (such as Ajax) to create a pleasant user experience when engaged in the grueling task of project management. The application should allow multiple users to manage a project and see the tasks, milestones, and their status. Additionally the application should allow resource management among multiple projects or tasks. For example, if the UI indicates that a certain task is running behind schedule, the project manager should be able to easily move a resource from one project to another. It should be as easy as drag and drop.</p>

 summary : <p>PSP Power Management PluginThis plugin has been designed and coded to optimize the energy consumption of the PSP while we stay in the XMB. </p>

<p>This plugin has 4 main functions described here. </p>

<p>Music Mode: To activate this mode you have to press L+R, this performs an underclock to 60Mhz for the CPU and 30 Mhz for the main system bus, suitable  to listen to your Mp3 and even ATRAC music files. Pressing again L+R will set the CPU/Bus speeds to the ones you had previously configured. Toggleidle: This mode disables the autoidle feature of the console (not of the screen) this mode can be toggled on/off by pressing R+START, useful when watching pictures of any kind (even pr0n!). Powerlock: Pressing R+NOTE you will lock the console power switch in order to prevent an accidental turn off of the system, if you toggled it on and you attempted to turn off the console it will simply don&#39;t, but when you unlock it, the console automatically will turn off (if you did not touch the power switch it will unlock but it won&#39;t turn off the system). Black Screen Mode: Pressing L+START we turn off the PSP Screen until we press L+START again, the screen will turn on and set itself with the previous brightness level you had. Useful used toghether with Music Mode it can save you a lot of battery! Software power off: Pressing R+SQUARE, the system will turn off totally, this feature was too easy to implement, I left this here because you liked it, and if it is useful to someone I won&#39;t remove it.

 title : The proctorticket Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ProctorTicket v0.4Copyright (c) 2008 Zachary Voase  </p>

<p>AboutProctorTicket is an application, written in Python, which allows you to read a parseable proctor output log, or run a proctor test, and import all generated errors as Trac tickets. Tickets are the equivalent of issues, tasks or bugs in other software project management systems. ProctorTicket will determine the test class each error belongs to and group them accordingly. In addition, ProctorTicket can tell when a test has already been carried out, and it will not add the issue. If a test has been carried out before but the results vary, then it will automatically update the tickets to reflect this. </p>

<p>ProctorTicket was created as part of the Google Highly Open Participation Contest, and can be found at http://code.google.com/p/proctorticket. </p>

<p>InstallationTo install ProctorTicket, ensure that: </p>

<p>You have the latest versions of both Proctor and Trac installed. You have a Trac environment already set up in a directory which you can write to. The executable proctorbatch is available on your system path variable. The modules trac and proctorlib can both be imported from your Python interpreter. To install, just type: </p>

<p>sudo python setup.py install 
<br/>from the directory to which you extracted the tarball or checked out the latest revision from Google Code SVN. </p>

<p>UsageThe command line interface to ProctorTicket, named proctorticket surprisingly enough, was written using optparse, so it has extensive documentation just by typing proctorticket --help at the command line. All of the functions and classes in the Python API have docstrings, so you can explore those from the interpreter or browse the included documentation, which was generated by epydoc. </p>

<p>An example of usage may be the following: </p>

<p>    proctorticket --keywords --log-file=example.log --env-path=/usr/share/trac \
<br/>        --reporter=zvoase --update proctor tracWhat this just did was: </p>

<p>Specified that there were going to be keywords coming up after all of the options. Used the Proctor output log file example.log. Used the Trac installation housed at /usr/share/trac. Set the reporter of all of the generated issues to &#39;zvoase&#39;. Set the keywords to &#39;proctor&#39; and &#39;trac&#39;. Told ProctorTicket that, should it find that the same test class has already been carried out, but there are differences, it should update the pre-existing ticket to reflect the changes. Play around with the --help option and see what else you can find.</p>
