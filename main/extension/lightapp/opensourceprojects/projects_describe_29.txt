 title : The PHP_Application Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PHP_Application is a platform for development of event-driven applications in which two mechanisms of distribution of events are realized. The first level are objects and their events, the second - the application and its events. The mechanism of distribution of events of the applications supports distribution of the directed and broadcasting events, and also provides synchronous or asynchronous processing events.</p>

<p>The structure of the application represents hierarchy of objects with various levels of abstraction. Functionality of the application is completely defined by a set of the objects included in the application, and interaction between them, i.e. a stream of events. The used application structure allows to operate a stream of events extending downwards on object hierarchy.</p>

 title : The Legacy Java CAS Client Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This Google Code project exists as a fork of what was originally the Yale Java CAS Client (and prior to that, the Java portion of the general Yale CAS Client library).</p>

<p>Subsequently, the JA-SIG CAS project, primarily Scott Battaglia, have brought into being a JA-SIG Java CAS Client. That is a Good Thing. It&#39;s next-generation. It&#39;s Springy. It&#39;s got shared source control and a maintenance stream. Go use that.</p>

<p>However, that codebase does have a bit of an impedance mismatch for folks used to using the legacy CAS client. Where can the legacy folks track bugs, build out documentation, collaborate in shared source control, or just reliably get this code? Where can this code live?  This is intended to be that place.</p>

 title : The firebug-firetest Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JavaScript Unit Testing Framework based on Firebug</p>

<p>From the homepage: </p>

<p>Firetest is my own afford to create a unit testing framework for JavaScript. I am not the kind of person who does projects like this but when the need arose and there were not suitable solutions that could fit my needs I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>Firetest is based on Furebug or, more specifically, FirebugLite, if you are running a browser other then Mozilla Firefox. The reason for this decision is because Firebug is probably the most mature JavaScript debugging console available at the time of releasing this project. I thought that it might be a good idea to leave the Firebug developers concentrate on their stuff while I concentrate on mine. This way, I don�t need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
