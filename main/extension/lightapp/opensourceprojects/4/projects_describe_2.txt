<p>&quot;To the staggeringly stupendous scribes who shaped Writer&#39;s Tools so spectacularly: I just downloaded and installed OpenOffice and your Writer&#39;s Tools extension and  I have to say that the stock functionality of OO.o3 is wonderful but your extension is absolutely ridiculously awesome and has made me turn my back on Word 2003. I haven&#39;t had a chance to play with the other programs but I can honestly say that in a matter of 30 minutes you and your extension changed a lifetime of hesitant yet obedient serfdom to the ever-present Microsoft and her silica clad hand of despotism and greed. Long live OpenOffice and especially Writer&#39;s Tools. If you were next to me right now I would give ya&#39; the biggest, most cuddliest bear hug you could ever imagine. Love you so long time Writer&#39;s Tools inventors. Love you soooo long time.&quot; Post in the Writer&#39;s Tools group by Michael J. </p>

 title : The wuacm-librarymanager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ProblemStudent groups often have libraries of books and reference materials that are available to use in the library area or to check out for a limited period of time.  These groups often do not have a robust, extendible system that allows its users to add additional books or easily track books that have been checked out. </p>

<p>IdeaCreate a library management system that can automatically add new books, track users, and provide statistics to the group about book usage, including the ability to use a scanning device an as interface to the application. </p>

<p>ProposalThe ACM would like to implement a library management system for student groups and professors to facilitate standard library functions including adding books to a collection, checking books out to users, and keeping track of book shelving information for easier organization.  We plan on having members create the infrastructure, including the databases, application, and controllers that allow the scanner to connect to the software.  This project provides a multitude of benefits including having a software package available for use across the campus, a learning environment for students to further their about software development, and creates exposure for the ACM by sponsoring this development project.  </p>

Stub classes developed for all ATC controller stations. Full ATIS loop ATC implemented, gets latest METAR data from the Internet and parses it to produce correct ATIS for any ICAO code (it doesn&#39;t yet handle the case where no report is available, needs to get nearest available in that case).

 title : The xbmc-image Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionThe purpose of this project is to build an unified image for usb pen drive, hard disk and san network boot from XBMC Live CD. </p>

<p>The script will generate a raw 4G disk image and you will have the freedom to put it onto your usb pen drive, hard disk or your server for network booting. The script I personally think is a reverse process of the usb installation script found in the Live CD, as It tries to unpack three raw images to disk partitions. Hope linuxer out there will appreciate it. </p>

<p>changes made so faruse grub as the boot loader for easy live modification of kernel options add a boot script in initramfs to handle graphic drivers according to xbmc kernel options usplash resolution changed to 1024x768 changed /usr/bin/diskmounter to by-pass xbmc system disks added a swap partition to /etc/fstab added most of the pci/pcmcia network card drivers so they should be loaded automatically if udev finds them (for network booting) To doinvestigate how to check ext3 disk in the initramfs environment. make boot faster some ideas:

<p>UpgradesUpgrades to the upcoming Atlantis release will be very easy. Since all modified files were saved in separate locations, one simple update script will do the trick and user changes (documents, settings for example) will not be lost during the upgrade. The resulting 4G disk image can be scaled up or down by the end user using common tools. </p>

 title : The xcards Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a project that I&#39;ve open sourced so that we can get a larger community base involved in building a simple, card-based planning and tracking tool.  The project is written in Ruby on Rails and is intended to use heavy Ajax for an easy to use, rich user interface.   </p>

<p>Thanks to Josh Knowles, Karmen Blake, Barry Kaplan, Steve Bate (XPlanner author) and Stan Green for discussions over the years on the perfect Agile tool and to James Deville for putting a boot to our arses and getting this project finally started.  We use xcards on itself, see (URL TBD) for a demonstration (and also for our officially hosted xcards project).  I&#39;m looking forward to see guys like Chance Anderson put a super professional user Ajax user interface on this simple tool. </p>

<p>The primary motive of this tool is to provide a SIMPLE and EFFECTIVE agile planning and tracking tool.  We have chosen the metaphor of a card.  Each unit of estimatable work is written on it&#39;s own card.  The estimates of the cards can be easily summed up and project duration/cost scenarios can be generated/edited and instantiated - tracking against multiple  projects is a long-term goal of this project - using the notion of project scenarios to help cost and track projects. </p>

<p>See also our discussion list at http://groups.google.com/group/xcards-developers.  Let&#39;s try to put most of our design and development discussion onto this list as possible. </p>

 title : The xcordion Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XCordion is the working title of an unofficial development branch of the open-source Concordion software specification and testing framework.  This is a work in progress, and not supported or sanctioned by the original authors of Concordion. </p>

<p>Concordion is a testing tool similar in approach to the FIT framework, but (we believe) easier to understand and use.  Non-technical team members write HTML documents containing plain-English acceptance test criteria.  This HTML is then instrumented with code and assertions at appropriate points in the document.  When the tests are run (usually by a JUnit test class), an output document is generated from the original document highlighting (through lots of pretty red/green colors) which assertions have passed and which have failed. </p>

<p>This Google Code project serves primarily as our public sandbox, as we develop changes which will be submitted back to the main Concordion maintainers at some point.  Our current goals include better table handling and the ability to run tests written for earlier, commercial releases of Concordion.  Future goals include support for other scripting engines, such as JRuby or Rhino.</p>

 title : The xeerkat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Xeerkat is a P2P computing framework that utilizes XMPP as a communication protocol.  The basic model is that of a agent computing where an agent runs a number of services that available to peers.  Each service is available over both HTTP and XMPP. </p>

<p>A service is a rest-style service that can communicate using any web-oriented protocol and implemented as a Restlet Application.  This allows reuse of any Restlet implementation as a agent service. </p>

<p>An agent-oriented set of services are provided throught Restlet context to facilitate building services. </p>

<p>News2008-07-07: The 2.1.0 release is now available.  See the release notes for a list of changes. 2008-07-07: The 0.6.0 release of the XMPP server is now available.  It now implements a heartbeat presence message to detect dead clients and also contains several fixes for stability related to network connections. StatusThe current code base is very stable an usable for applications.  The only major missing feature is better discovery mechanisms.  The current code relies upon presence management and works well in situations where every &quot;worker&quot; agent knows a common &quot;broker&quot; agent&quot;.  Those workers who have the same broker agent will know about each other by periodically checking with the broker agent. </p>

<p>The current version is 2.1.0 and now uses an installer.  Just double-click on the jar file or type:  </p>

<p>   java -jar xeerkat-2.1.0.jarXMPP ServerWhile the Xeerkat agent code will work with any XMPP server I&#39;ve been frustrated by the lack of features for my needs in may other XMPP servers.  As such, I built an experimental server that utilizes the same infoset processing technology and restlet engine as the client.  The current version supports basic presence handling and rosters and also supports dynamic configuration of &quot;virtual hosts&quot; via Atom feeds. </p>

<p>The server requires a basic auth webservice for authentication.  I use my authservice from the atomojo project. </p>

<p>The server does not support server-to-server connections and so does not federate with other services.  It does support inter-communication between different hosts on the same server. </p>

<p>These documents should help the brave try out this server </p>

<p>Server Administration Using Atomojo&#39;s Auth Service HistoryThe Xeerkat project grew out of a P2P grid computing project that originally used JXTA.  Eventually issues with JXTA forced a re-examination of what technologies were needed.  As each peer is actually on the edge, XMPP was a good choice for a communication technology. </p>

<p>The project was originally hosted as xeerkat at java.net and was moved to this project.  The original code is available there with the JXTA support and that is considered the &quot;1.0&quot; version. </p>

<p>This code has been completely refactored and removes many of the restrictions to XML and opens up the ability to create P2P REST-oriented services.  Underneath, XML is used as appropriate in the XMPP transport. </p>

<p>XMPP URI ReferencesXeerkat uses URIs to tunnel requests over XMPP.  The general format of the URI is: </p>

<p>xeerkat://{sender-id}/{sender-resource}/{receiver-id}/{receiver-resource}/{path}The final {path} part of the URI is the same path as the service over HTTP.  For example, if the &#39;status&#39; service is available from: </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080/statusthen for sender &#39;test@talk.example.com&#39; and agent host &#39;peer@talk.example.com&#39;, that same service is available (depending on resource names) at: </p>

<p>xeerkat://test@talk.example.com/shell/peer@talk.example.com/agent/statusYou can also omit the resource of the receiver: </p>

<p>xeerkat://test@talk.example.com/shell/peer@talk.example.com//statusAs the local client makes a connection to the XMPP server as themselves, the &quot;host&quot; information is the local connection and that&#39;s why the URI starts with your XMPP id. </p>

<p>Since XMPP messaging is asynchronous, a client can use the sxeerkat scheme to simulate a synchronous request. </p>

<p>DocumentationGetting Started with Xeerkat The Agent API documentation. A Distributed Ping ExampleThe simplest test infrastructure is distributed ping where an single agent is going to &quot;ping&quot; other agents for a certain number of times.  All Xeerkat services are just Restlet Application instances and so we need to do is write a simple Restlet Application and then package it for the agent. </p>

<p>The main part of a Application in Restlet is the createRoot method.  Here we&#39;ll create a Router to route requests: </p>

<p>   public Restlet createRoot() {
<br/>      
<br/>      // Create a router for the root of the application
<br/>      Router router = new Router(getContext());
<br/>and then we&#39;ll create a main restlet for processing ping requests: </p>

<p>      Restlet main = new Restlet(getContext()) {
<br/>         
<br/>         public void handle(Request request, Response response) {</p>

<p>         }
<br/>      }
<br/>and then we attach it to the router: </p>

<p>   router.attach(&quot;&quot;,main);
<br/>   router.attach(&quot;/&quot;,main);The two attach statements above let the service respond to ping and ping/. </p>

<p>The service receives an XML message with the number of requests.  We won&#39;t bore you with the details of parsing the XML.  Once the number is known, all that is necessary is to loop until a maximum time has been reached or the number of pings have been received. </p>

<p>That code looks like: </p>

<p>                  // loop till we&#39;ve timed out or received all the responses
<br/>                  while(stat.receivedNow, pings are received at &quot;/ping/echo&quot; and so we just define a simple restlet to handle them: </p>

<p>      router.attach(&quot;/echo&quot;,new Restlet(getContext()) {
<br/>         public void handle(Request request, Response response) {
<br/>            response.setEntity(request.getEntity());
<br/>            response.setStatus(Status.SUCCESS_OK);
<br/>         }
<br/>      });The neat bit here is that all these resources are available over both HTTP and XMPP. </p>

<p>The last step is to package the service for the agent.  The agent currently requires the service to packaged as a separate jar file.  At the root of the jar file there must be an &#39;application.xml&#39; resource that looks like: </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  The full source is available from subversion as PingApplication.java.</p>

<p>Basically you can specify an xml playlist from the url, and have it play whatever is in the playlist… </p>

<p>The links for the examples are on the right side. </p>

<p>You can also specify the playlist in the url if you&#39;d like: </p>

<p>http://axel.cfwebtools.com/Examples/xspfPlayer/bin/xmlPlayer.cfm?playlist%5Furl=http://killtheheart.com/playlist.xml </p>

<p>here are the variables you can use: </p>

<p>playlist_url : the url of the xspf file to load  repeat_playlist : boolean value that make the repeats the playlist after the end  song_url : String the href location of a single song you want to play, when this is used playlist_url is ignored song_title : the name of the song you want to use podcast_mode : the boolean value that makes the playlist_url be a rss feed for a podcast for example http://axel.cfwebtools.com/Examples/xspfPlayer/bin/xmlPlayerSmall.cfm?podcast_mode=true&amp;playlist_url=http://www.theflexshow.com/blog/rss.cfm The music player can also be used to play single mp3 files instead of playlists, the parameters are: </p>

<p>song_url : the url of the single mp3 you want to play song_title : the text to replace the players default&#39;s </p>

<p>and you could even create a custom playlist on your site (this link doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s an example) http://flexcoders.nl/someplaylist.xml </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>and as long as it was in the right format, it’s all good….  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>here is the format http://axel.cfwebtools.com/Examples/xspfPlayer/bin/data.xml </p>

<p>right click and view source to actually copy and paste xml... </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>It’s loosely based on the xspf (‘spiff’) standard, it’s an open source shareable playlist format…   </p>

<p>Here is the documentation on it: </p>

<p>About the XOOPS Cube
<br/>XOOPS Cube is an Open Source Web Application Platform, empowering everyone to create dynamic and content rich websites with ease. It is highly compatible with XOOPS, allowing users to implement and enjoy their favourite XOOPS modules (have to be at least 2.0.7 compliant), while using the new and improved Object Oriented Web Application Platform - XOOPS Cube. 
<br/> 
<br/>XOOPS Cube is the ideal tool for developing small to large community websites, intranet portals, corporate websites, web blogs, or what ever you need - XOOPS Cube will help you set up your site in no time. All you need is a server (e.g., Apache) that has PHP and a database (e.g. MySQL) installed. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference between XOOPS and XOOPS Cube?
<br/>XOOPS, like other Nuke derivatives such as PHP-Nuke, is labeled a Content Management System (CMS), which can be extended with modules. Users can add or change certain functions by selecting modules that meet their needs. Though it is less flexible if a user needs to customize authentication functions, web accessibility, and the like.

 title : The xoopscubebrasil Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XOOPS is an Open Source Web Application Platform, empowering webmasters to create dynamic and content rich websites with ease. It is highly compatible with XOOPS, allowing users to implement and enjoy their favourite XOOPS modules (have to be at least 2.0.7 compliant), while using the new and improved Object Oriented Web Application Platform - XOOPS Cube.</p>

<p>It is the ideal tool for developing small to large community websites, intranet portals, corporate websites, weblogs, or what ever you need - XOOPS Cube will help you set up your site in no time. All you need is a server (e.g., Apache) that has PHP and a database (e.g. MySQL) installed.
<br/>What&#39;s the difference between XOOPS and XOOPS Cube?</p>

<p>XOOPS, like other Nuke derivatives such as PHP-Nuke, is labelled a Content Management System (CMS), which can be extended with modules. Users can add or change certain functions by selecting modules that meet their needs. Though it is less flexible if a user needs to customize authentication functions, web accessibility, and the like.</p>

<p>XOOPS Cube enables you to build your website with greater flexibility. It is not just a CMS, but a Web Application Platform. This allows you to design your own CMS to suit all your needs.</p>

<p>In XOOPS Cube functions of the XOOPS System Module have been placed into their own modules, such as account management and private messages.

 summary : <p>The XOR Project, or Project Xavier (on Rails), strives to present a light-weight, cross-platform facade for OpenGL, using SDL. It does this by providing high-level constructs and convenient constructors. The end goal of Project Xavier is a framework that will allow creation of visualizations through XML generated by a simple GUI.</p>

<p>Project Xavier also includes support for doing trivial cluster graphics (video wall setup). This implementation is not seen as in competition with Chromium, as our goal is ease of use, not completeness.</p>

 title : The xss-shield Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XSS Shield protects your views against cross-site scripting attacks without error-prone manual escaping with h(). </p>

<p>Instead of: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= h(item.name) %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= link_to &quot;#{h(item.first_name)}&#39;s stuff&quot;, :action =&gt; :view, :id =&gt; item %&gt;</p>

<p>You will be able to write: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= item.name %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= link_to &quot;#{item.first_name}&#39;s stuff&quot;, :action =&gt; :view, :id =&gt; item %&gt;</p>

<p>and all your views will be automatically protected. Protection works by tagging strings you trust - which are only those escaped by h(), generated by trusted helpers (like link_to, text_area, will_paginate etc.), or explicitly marked as trusted by you. If untrusted string is to be displayed in a template it is h-escaped first. </p>

<p>XSS Shield supports RHTML and HAML. </p>

<p>To install the plugin run: </p>

<p>  ./script/plugin install -x http://xss-shield.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xss-shield/</p>
 title : The xssterminate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>xss_terminatexss_terminate is a plugin in that makes stripping and sanitizing HTML stupid-simple. Install and forget. And forget about forgetting to h() your output, because you won‘t need to anymore.  </p>

<p>But xss_terminate is also flexible. By default, it will strip all HTML tags from user input. This is usually what you want, but sometimes you need users to be able to enter HTML. The plugin allows you remove bad HTML with your choice of two whitelist-based sanitizers, or to skip HTML sanitization entirely on a per-field basis.   </p>

<p>To install, do: </p>

<p>script/plugin install git://github.com/look/xss_terminate.gitHTML sanitization  </p>

<p>A note on your choices. </p>

<p>Strip tags: removes all HTML using Rails&#39;s built-in trip_tags method. Tags are removed, but their content is not. Rails sanitization: Removes bad HTML with Rails&#39;s built-in sanitize method. Bad tags are removed completely, including their content. HTML5lib sanitization: Removes bad HTML after parsing it with HTML5lib, a library that parses HTML like browsers do. It should be very tolerant of invalid HTML. Bad tags are escaped, not removed. Do nothing. You can chose not to process given fields. UsageInstalling the plugin creates a before_save hook that will strip HTML tags  from all string and text fields. No further configuration is necessary if this is what you want. To customize the behavior, you use the xss_terminate class  method. </p>

<p>To exempt some fields from sanitization, use the :except option  with a list of fields not to process: </p>

<p> class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>   xss_terminate :except =&gt; [ :body ]
<br/> endTo sanitize HTML with Rails&#39;s built-in sanitization, use the :sanitize option: </p>

<p>  class Review &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>    xss_terminate :sanitize =&gt; [ :body, :author_name]
<br/>  endTo sanitize HTML with HTML5Lib  (gem install html5 to get it), use the :html5lib_sanitize  option with a list of fields to sanitize: </p>

<p> class Entry &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>   xss_terminate :html5lib_sanitize =&gt; [ :body, :author_name ]
<br/> endYou can combine multiple options if you have some fields you would like skipped and others sanitized. Fields not listed in the option arrays will be stripped. </p>

<p> class Message &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>   xss_terminate :except =&gt; [ :body ], :sanitize =&gt; [ :title ]
<br/> endSanitizing existing recordsAfter installing xss_terminate and configuring it to your liking, you can  run rake xss_terminate MODELS=Foo,Bar,Baz to execute it against your existing records. This will load each model found and save it again to invoke the before_save hook. </p>

<p>Unique featuresxss_terminate is based on acts_as_sanitized. Here is what&#39;s different: </p>

<p>Rails 2.0-ready. Automatic. It is included with default options in ActiveReord::Base so all your models are sanitized. It works with migrations. Columns are fetched when model is saved, not when the class is loaded. You can decide whether to sanitize or strip tags on a field-by-field basis instead of model-by-model. HTML5lib support. TODOPerformance tests Test suites with &quot;real world&quot; HTML Test/make work with Rails 1.2.x (Rails 1.2 sanitization is crap, so you&#39;d want to use HTML5lib) CreditsWritten by Luke Francl and based on acts_as_sanitized by  Alex Payne. </p>

<p>HTML5Lib sanitization by Jacques Distler. </p>

<p>LicenseMIT License, except for lib/html5lib_sanitize.rb which is under the  Ruby license and copyright to Jacques Distler. </p>

<p>Other optionsxss-shield - automatically h() strings unless marked as &quot;safe&quot; sanitize_params - sort of like xss_terminate but it works on the controller level. SafeErb - does not allow strings not marked untainted to be displayed. Erubis - can auto-escape HTML by default. Use in conjuction with xss_terminate if you&#39;re truly paranoid!</p>

 title : The y2038 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is in need of an experienced C programmer to apply C best practices. </p>

<p>This project is in need of more cross platform testing </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a drop-in replacement for POSIX time.h which will work on machines which have a 32-bit time_t, yet not suffer from the 2038 bug.  This will allow C programmers to be 2038-safe without having to rewrite their software to a new interface.  It does this while still using the system time zone database. </p>

<p>Many Unix time and date functions cannot calculate a date beyond Tuesday, January 19, 2038.  This is known as the Year 2038 Problem and it effects most Unix and Macintosh computers currently in use. </p>

<p>Unlike the Y2K bug, it is by design and we know how to fix it.  time_t, the data type which stores time on Unix, is normally only large enough to hold time up to 2038.  Making it larger would solve the problem.  Many 64 bit operating systems have done that, but that requires recompiling much of your software, so many have not.  For example, most Macs run on a 64 bit processor but still use the smaller 32 bit time_t. </p>

<p>Our first targets are Perl, Ruby and Python. </p>

<p>The first goal is to replicate localtime() and gmtime() in order to allow Perl to work around a system&#39;s 2038 limit.  There is now a bleadperl branch for the 2038 fix. </p>

<p>The y2038 project is funded in part by a grant from The Perl Foundation. </p>

<p>What works?The following functions are implemented and well tested. </p>

<p>localtime64_r() localtime64() gmtime64_r() gmtime64() timegm64() mktime64() asctime64_r() asctime64() ctime64_r() ctime64() What platforms?This complies with the POSIX standard for time.h and will work with any decent ANSI C89 compiler. </p>

<p>Want to help?Please send a message to y2038-users, or do a code review, or post an issue, or try out the code on your machine and let us know how it works out.</p>

<p>1. Download and install CMake (if you don&#39;t have root privileges, just install to a local directory, like ~/bin) </p>

<p>2. From the source directory, run: </p>

<p>mkdir build
<br/>cd build
<br/>cmake ..and then the usual </p>

<p>make
<br/>make install3. To clean up, just remove the &#39;build&#39; directory.</p>

The game is card-strategy in which you place your army of zombies or pirates on an hexagonal-tiled board, and try to destroy the enemy&#39;s base. Each turn you can chose to move, charge, guard or use an attack card. Each character has its own cards, and each card it&#39;s own range, power and energy used. Moves are limited too, which makes the game more strategic.</p>

 title : The zend-datagrid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The zend-framework-datagrid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&quot;Zend Framework DataGrid&quot; is a project / component written in PHP5, specially developed to work with Zend Framework, aims to generate grids or list from a Data Source such Zend_Db_Table,  Zend_Db_Select,  Zend_Db_Adapter,  Propel, Array, and so on. With features like sort columns (sort / order by), pagination and an appropriate render depending on the type of column.  </p>

<p>Once you have checkout or downloaded the libraries, you should copy the &quot;Core&quot; folder inside the &quot;library&quot; folder of our project (where is Zend Framework, etc.).  </p>

<p>By default uses Zend_View as rendering engine, but its interface leaves open to use with any other render engine such Smarty or even XML or CSV / TXT.  </p>

<p>As mentioned above, the render DataGrid uses Zend_View by default, this implies that we must add the script-</p>
 title : The zend-framework-orm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>&quot;Zend Framework Db Table ORM&quot; is a project that aims to give greater ORM functionality to Zend_Db_Table Relationships. </p>

<p>These extend the class &quot;Zend_Db_Table_Abstract&quot; and &quot;Zend_Db_Table_Row_Abstract&quot; without touching or altering anything of its existing features.  </p>

<p>You can download libraries through SVN on the following link or can be downloaded directly from Downloads. </p>

<p>Also, it’s mandatory to use the adapter database &quot;Zsamer_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql&quot; because it gives some advantages for using transactions employed in the ORM. If you are using Mysql, I recommend the use of the InnoDB engine because it supports transactions. </p>

<p>By default, the adapter for Mysql it’s ready, but if you gonna use another adapter like Oracle (e.g) it’s necessary to create the appropriate class that extends the adapter to use. See link installation &amp; configuration. </p>

<p>To use the adapter mentioned is necessary to include the following line in the config.ini connection:  </p>

<p>database.adapter = pdo_mysql
<br/>database.params.adapterNamespace = Zsamer_Db_Adapter;The repository has a complete set of implementation examples  inside the &quot;application&quot; folder, which includes the config.ini file, orm.sql and a module called &quot;cms&quot;, with controllers of examples (ContentController and ProjectController ) and their respective models classes. </p>

<p>The repository also includes the Mysql tables of the examples in a .sql file (orm.sql); this one is in the &quot;application&quot; folder with the .ini config file.  </p>

<p>The examples are in InnoDB Engine to support transactions,  and Constraint (referential integrity).  </p>

<p>This project is/was just a proof of concept, a way to demonstrate the &quot;current state&quot; of modularity and distribution within the Zend Framework.  I am no longer going to be working on this, as updates to the framework are slowly making this obsolete (like Zend_Tool). </p>

<p>I will leave this up, for archival purposes, so feel free to download / try out the code.  It should at least offer a good starting point for those new to zend framework and ACL.  But I will not be responding to any bugs or maintaining this project anymore. </p>

<p>Nov 20, 2008: Small Updates </p>

<p>If you update to the newest svn (r138), you will get some new features: </p>

<p>1) Security System updates via migrations.  You will need to do this to access the other feature.  Go to /security/update in your browser. </p>

<p>2) Custom login/logout routes.  Use this if you want users to be routed to the non-default login form, and specify where to drop users off when they&#39;ve logged out, rather than back at the login screen. </p>

<p>Some other misc issues have been fixed as well.  Enjoy! </p>

 summary : <p>One can argue that while the trivial update problem causes trouble in Lisp and its relatives, it does not reflect an inherent weakness of functional programming per se.  What is requited for a solution is a combination of convenient notation--to access arbitrary elements of a complex structure--and an implementation that is able to determine when the old version of the structure will never be used again, so it can be updated in place instead of being copied. 
<br/>~ Michael L. Scott, Programming Language Pragmatics S11.2 
<br/>One final note: both of these models are more easily implemented using a functional programming style. Something as simple as immutable objects makes both local messaging and transactions much simpler and more efficient. It&#39;s funny how good practices pay off in ways we don&#39;t expect. 
<br/>~ http://toomuchcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/imaginary-concurrency-debate.html 
<br/>Most functional programming languages are implemented using garbage collection, but while GC is effective for managing memory, it cannot give quick runtime information about usage.  Zhe will use reference counting so that where persistence is unnecessary, operations can be implemented destructively. </p>

<p>Other proposed features: </p>

<p>Not purely functional, for I/O simplicity. Not curried, to allow overloaded functions. No sexpers, because infix and syntax is nice. Full runtime multiple dispatch. OO-reminiscent syntax, without the limitations</p>
 summary : <p>ZHM&#39;s goal is to provide inter-process communication using zero-hop multicast. </p>

<p>Inter-process communication (IPC) can be used to a access code functionality that otherwise might not be accessible. E.g. OS X contains many excellent features but they can only be accessed using a small number of interfaces. Specifically Carbon and Cocoa have rich feature sets that are not easily leveraged using Ruby or C#. </p>

<p>ZHM offers a mechanism for accessing locked-in functionality via multicasting and sockets. If your code can join a multicast group you can use ZHM. </p>

<p>Multicast capability is included in most operating system&#39;s IP-stacks. ZHM uses a time-to-live, TTL, of zero to multicast messages within the boundary of a single host computer. This TTL=0, or zero-hop, technique is very efficient at multicasting messages to any client-processes that have registered with a given multicast group.</p>

 title : The zing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Zing?Zing is an opensocial compliant social Networking Site (SNS) built in Java web technology. It is using Apache’s Java Shindig framework for OpenSocial compliance. While we (see the about us section below) were developing Zing, one of the most important thing for us was to keep it simple. Zing has almost all of the basic SNS features like application gallery, scrapbook, albums, media items, mailing option etc. Yet is very simple and straightforward to understand and use.  </p>

<p>Zing is currently version 0.9 beta </p>

<p>What can I do with ZingYou can leverage zing as a base for building your social networking site. It is opensocial compatible, so that is a bonus. You can use zing as a reference implementation of opensocial compliance using Apache’s Java Shindig framework. How can I use ZingGo to our getting started page here-http://code.google.com/p/zing/wiki/gettingStarted. We also have a brief about the architecture of our application here-http://code.google.com/p/zing/wiki/Architecture </p>

<p>What is zing’s short term roadmapVerify on unix/linux and Macintosh platforms. A brand new look &amp; feel Turnkey deployment Easily customizable look and feel. Compliance with all of OpenSocial’s REST based interfaces as OpenSocial API matures.    </p>

<p>Technical briefOpensocial version 0.8 SNS container is integrated with Apache Shindig Java Server, which is an open source  implementation of the OpenSocial specification and gadgets specification. The integration of Shindig with SNS is done via iFrames, which provides the environment to execute the gadgets inside the web pages.  The RESTful capabilities of the Shindig container are exposed through RESTful Service Handler. Caja is used in Shindig Container to safely allow scripts gadgets provided by third party. OAuth, used in SNS, allows to access private resources (photos, videos, contact list, bank accounts) stored on one site with another site without having to hand out username and password.

<p>News: Zoie 2.0.0-rc3 is released (2/17/2010) - Requires Lucene 2.9.x or Lucene 3.0. </p>

<p>Originally developed at LinkedIn.com. </p>

<p>Donated by LinkedIn.com on July 19, 2008. </p>

<p>Zoie is a mature open source project and has been deployed in a real-time large-scale consumer website: LinkedIn.com handling millions of searches as well as hundreds of thousands of updates daily. </p>

<p>All Zoie releases have gone through extensive functional and performance testing by LinkedIn before made public. </p>

<p>In a real-time search/indexing system, a document is made available as soon as it is added to the index. This functionality is especially important to time-sensitive information such as news, job openings, tweets etc. </p>

<p>This poses the following challenges which Zoie addresses: </p>

<p>Additions of documents must be made available to searchers immediately Indexing must not affect search performance Additions of documents must not fragment the index (which hurts search performance) Deletes and/or updates of documents must not affect search performance. ... Additional Zoie features: </p>

<p>fast lucene docid to uid mapping fast uid to lucene docid mapping (reverse id mapping) Live updates custom MergePolicy to handle realtime updates partial delete expunge for enhancing search performance without full optimize balanced index segment management full jmx console for indexing management/monitoring ...

 title : The zoop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutZoop is a PHP framework used to help speed development of web applications.  The current stable (1.x) branch is located here.  This is currently the development branch.  There will be one more major release of the 1.x branch (1.5).  After the 1.5 release we will start preparing a release of this branch and the new, stable, 2.0 branch of Zoop.  </p>

<p>This branch is a from the ground up reworking of the entire framework.  Many components have been rewritten from scratch, some have been audited, tweaked and moved over.  Because of this many applications written for the 1.x branch won&#39;t currently run on 2.0.  In order to ease the transition we will provide a compatibility layer that will allow the old applications to run on 2.0 or at least make the porting process easier.  We will also provide a legacy directory with all of the old Zoop 1.5 code so that applications will be able to transition over to the 2.0 components gradually. </p>

 title : The zpyodbcda Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ZPyODBCDAZPyODBCDA is a free Zope Database Adapter which links Zope to ODBC data sources. It is based on Python&#39;s pyodbc moudle (http://pyodbc.sourceforge.net) and distributed under the GPL licence.  </p>

<p>RequirementsZPyODBCDA requires Python 2.4 or higher. </p>

<p>Win32If your Zope runs on a Win32 platform, you probably don&#39;t need any other modules, as I already included pyodbc&#39;s binary code (pyodbc.pyd) in the package folder; </p>

<p>LinuxFor other platforms like Linux, you may first need unixODBC installed on your OS, and then install the pyodbc module for your Python instance. Here&#39;s a good article in which you can refer the method to setup unixODBC on Linux: http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/ms-sql-server-on-linux </p>

<p>ODBC back-ended ZSQLDo not use ZSQL methods with ZPyODBCDA It&#39;s a headache for a ZSQL method to generate 100% correct SQLs based on the different SQL syntaxes, because ODBC data sources link to different databases with different SQL syntaxes (eg: if the odbc source is a MSSQL server, in a query string, you would use a &#39;&#39; to represent a &#39; character, while with MySQL you would use a \&#39;).  </p>

<p>The current solution I suggest:  </p>

<p>Create one ZSQL with ID &quot;ZSqlMethod&quot; (say): Add a parameter &quot;sql&quot; for the &quot;ZSqlMethod&quot; ZSQL method, and in the body of the ZSQL method, simply put a  In your ZPT or Python script, use container.ZSqlMethod(sql=&#39;SELECT a,b,c FROM foo;&#39;) to run a query. That means you need to construct the SQL in the context by yourself! You need to prevent injection attacks with this method!  </p>

<p>Good luck. </p>

 title : The lightGrid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Current implementations of &quot;big Grids&quot; (EGEE/WLCG, Int.EU.Grid, ...) are based on very complex software layers which make the deployment and maintenance of the infrastructure a real headache. Additionally, by using many software layers which in addition use polling mechanisms, the feeling of using it is much more close to batch systems than to interactive ones, which are needed sometimes. 
<br/> 
<br/>These characteristics of existing Grid software prevent many organizations from benefiting of the good side of Grids: sharing computational resources that are otherwise wasted, distributed computing with location transparency, etc. 
<br/> 
<br/>So this project intends to provide that kind of software for a laboratory as a proof-of-concept implementation.</p>

 title : The django-mediacat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-mediacat is a small app with only one view, which lets you retrieve several media files from the server with only one HTTP request. Usually, designers and developers like to spread CSS and JavaScript files out into several files on the web server, and then request only the necessary files for each web page. Whilst this approach is more modular, and hence prevents the downloading of unnecessary files, the fragmentation also incurs a significant performance hit on the web server, as each part represents the overhead of a full HTTP request. What django-mediacat does is allow you to set up several &#39;aliases&#39;; short names for media files on the web server. These can then be queried from one URL, and django-mediacat will concatenate all requested files into one, eliminating overhead.</p>

All is performed with the idea of being able of running an XPath query as soon as possible without having to fight with the document&#39;s namespaces and by seeing automatically under which namespace each element is.</p>

<p>This program is not an XML editor, at least not at this point, it&#39;s meant to be used for constructing and executing XPath queries.</p>
