 summary : <p>The main goal of bui is to provide an abstraction layer for user interface. This layer can then be extended to fit target domain that handles the actual rendering of user interface elements, windowing and events.</p>

<p>User interface structure is defined as a tree consisting of containers and elements. Containers can contain other containers and elements. Elements represent actual user interface which the user can see. At the moment structure is defined using YAML.</p>

<p>Additionally it is possible to use events to manipulate the tree. Also constraints applying to whole user interface may be implemented.</p>

<p>Currently the work is under heavy development. Examples working in Blender have been provided for those being adventurous.</p>

 title : The Tangra framework for PHP Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tangra is a framework for development of PHP5 applications. Its main target is to boost the productivity of the developers. It consist code library, modules and control center. General idea is by providing consistent, robust and powerful tools and environment to free the developers from annoying repetitive tasks and let them concentrate on important parts of the applications.</p>

<p>Basic principle is modularity – most of the classes that will be used directly by the users are placed into modules and just the core functionality resides in the code library. That way new module features and bug fixes can be easily distributed and end users will be able to upgrade by single click, letting modules manager to take care about the compatibility and dependencies.</p>
