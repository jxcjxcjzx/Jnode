 title : The R Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.</p>
 title : The XChat-GNOME Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XChat-GNOME is a new frontend to the popular X-Chat IRC client which is designed with the user interface foremost in mind. Historically, the OSS desktop has been steadily improving in usability, accessibility, and general slickness, yet the world of IRC clients has not kept up.</p>

<p>GNOME’s philosophy in terms of user interfaces has been progressing towards presenting the user with few options and sane defaults.</p>

<p>The authors decided that the GTK+ frontend provided excessive customizability without sufficient organization, which lead to clutter and confusion.</p>

<p>As such, XChat-GNOME was born, and is gaining popularity as an IRC client for people who care more about chatting than tweaking settings. If anyone is interested in helping out with the project, stop by #xchat-gnome on irc.freenode.net.</p>
