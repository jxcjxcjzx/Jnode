 title : The Camp Eclipse Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A collection of plug-ins for Eclipse that are developed during CampEclipse code camps. The CampEclipse events are conventions of programmers that work on Eclipse extensions (aka plug-in&#39;s). Those events provide an excellent chance to solve existing problems, discuss new ideas and meet other developers face-to-face. During the camp we develop prototypes which we would like to evolve to demos for the use of Eclipse features that others can benefit from. Some prototypes will become projects in their own right. This java.net project helps to build better Java development tools by supporting research and education of an active developer community.</p>

 title : The GtkCAD Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When engineers start a new project, they must use many separate programs to design, analyze, and create the production drawings. These separate programs are most likely from different vendors using non-compatible data formats. The translation process between all these data formats can take many non-productive hours. In addition, any changes to the design often affect many separate drawings and software programs that must be changed independently
<br/>GtkCAD is a new program that attempts to solve many of these problems by integrating these many individual programs into a program suite with a single user interface and a common data format.
<br/>GtkCAD&#39;s modular design allows the user to load plug-in modules at runtime to add the functionality needed for the task at hand. The modular design also allows the user to customize GtkCAD to suit their particular needs at any given time. For example the hydrostatics program, used by naval architects, may not be very useful to civil engineers. This potential cost savings feature allows a customer to custom-build a system based upon their needs.
<br/>Linux is a true multi-user Operating System, and GtkCAD is designed to take advantage of this by allowing multiple engineers to use a single binary copy of the program simultaneously. The use of shared libraries lowers the memory footprint by allowing multiple users of the program to share a single copy of the library, and also saves time during software upgrades. The use of a SQL database also allows controlled access of the data by several engineers simultaneously, remotely if necessary.

 title : The e-Gen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>e-Gen Developer is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment that enables a highly productive development of transactional Web applications, entirely written in Java and based on Java Server Faces ( next version ) and Jakarta Struts framework. </p>

<p>The main purpose of e-Gen is to overcome some of the most relevant challenges faced by IT managers:  increase the productivity, reduce the maintenance costs, and reduce the time needed for training the team members.</p>

<p>The productivity of the development team is fundamental to accomplish the projects in the right time and with low costs. The e-Gen provides to the developer team with a set of visual resources and facilities that make the application development a very easy and fast task. </p>

<p>The maintenance of the systems is also a very important element because the business environments are more dynamic than ever before. In the e-Gen, the generated code is the same for all the members of the team. All the maintenance tasks can be easily done in the same environment and it is not necessary to read or to write anything in the source code files. The application maintenance becomes easy and fast, enabling any member of the team to do the task. </p>

<p> 
<br/>The Web-based applications are supported by a set of technologies (HTML, JSF, Java Script, XML, DHTML, Java APIs, JSP, Servlets, SQL, etc) and the team must be prepared to handle all of them. This means a high cost of training and difficulties to maintain the productivity of the team. The e-Gen generates all codes using the best practices and patterns, even when the programmer is not an expert. The inclusion or substitution of a programmer can be done easily and with low cost of training.</p>

<p>Working with e-Gen, we have experimented a highly increase in the team productivity. We could reduce the costs and the time of the systems maintenance. The management of the quality of the work became much easier, because the e-Gen reduced sharply the knowledge requirements of each team member.</p>

<p>The result is the rapid development of applications with scalability, performance, manageability, reliability, security, quality and low cost.</p>

 title : The Internet Based Application System Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SAIB is a technological infrastructure for the generation of Internet-based financial applications, ranging from Electronic Commerce to Internet Banking through to on-line Trading. It is therefore aimed at all Enterprises operating in financial sectors, typically Banks, Insurance Companies and Public Administrations, with solutions characterised by Internet as the main transmission channel, to attain a complete and modern management of the &quot;interaction with the Customer and/or with the Citizen&quot; phase.</p>

<p>Multi-channelling: the services and applications implemented with the SAIB architecture are accessible to Users over multiple channels: WEB browser on PC, electronic mail messages, multi-medial kiosks, set-top box, SMS via GSM cellular telephony, WAP on GSM, WAP on GPRS, UMTS. </p>

<p>Customising of User interface: the SAIB system guarantees an elevated degree of flexibility in the definition of the graphic layout presented to the Customer. In fact, it is possible to operate having previously established the rules that define the graphic interfaces according to the Customer’s reference class.</p>

<p>Data Mining Engine: it is an integral part of the SAIB architecture. Among other functions, it allows the automatic &quot;profiling&quot; of the Customers - Users for the definition of “sample targets” to which the Company marketing campaigns can be aimed. </p>

<p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) : the PKI integrated in the a SAIB technological infrastructure allows the Companies that have made or intend making their financial application accessible on the Internet channels, the possibility of creating a “virtual community” of its Customers. It will be the Company itself that, by utilising SAIB’s PKI tools, will be able to authorise and release certificates to its Customers to fully exploit all the security levels present on the Web. </p>

<p>Integration of Legacy environments: SAIB’s technological infrastructure allows the &quot;uncoupling&quot; of the applications laid out at legacy levels from the new services developed, in particular those based on Internet. 
<br/>It therefore becomes very simple and convenient to develop new and articulated applications, utilising services that are already operating at legacy level, and integrated by new functions on new transmission technologies.</p>

<p>CRM-oriented : the possibility of integrating multiple pre-existing heterogeneous “worlds” in the SAIB environment with the new Customer realities made available by Internet’s transmission multi-channelling nature, allows the easy implementation of Customer Relationship Management-oriented applications. 
<br/>The logging and monitoring centrally implemented by SAIB on the operations carried out by the Users together with the functions of a Data Base, designed by taking into account the CRM themes, constitute a solid base upon which to build new applications of this nature.</p>

<p>Modularity: the SAIB system is made up by independent modules that can be integrated among themselves in order to implement innovative, and at times complex, applications.
<br/>This implementation choice makes it possible to utilise SAIB’s infrastructure in a flexible and optimised way, without burdening the system with modules that are not necessary to the implemented application or with functions that are already supported through other solutions.</p>
