 title : The barrage Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill and destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. Additionally you have to keep an eye on your ammo and reload in time. Useful to kill some minutes of idle time. :)</p>
 title : The JiBX Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of control over the translation process.</p>

<p>Subprojects include JiBX/WS for fast web services based on JiBX, and JiBX/OTA for working with Open Travel Alliance XML schemas and messages.</p>
 title : The OpenVZ Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OpenVZ is container-based virtualization for Linux. OpenVZ creates multiple secure, isolated containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict. Each container performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server; a container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users, IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries and configuration files.</p>

 title : The Zapper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Zapper is a PHP base Ajax/XAP toolkit with the ability to persist objects on client side. Development version, not really ready for production.</p>
 title : The Mocha (Ruby Mock/Stub Library) Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mocha is a library for mocking and stubbing using a syntax like that of JMock, and SchMock. Most commonly Mocha is used in conjunction with Test::Unit, but it can be used in other contexts.</p>

<p>One of its main advantages is that it allows you to mock and stub methods on real (non-mock) classes and instances. You can for example stub ActiveRecord instance methods like create, save, destroy and even class methods like find to avoid hitting the database in unit tests.</p>

<p>Mocha provides a unified, simple and readable syntax for both traditional mocking and for mocking with real objects.</p>

<p>Mocha has been harvested from projects at Reevoo by me (James) and my colleagues Ben, Chris and Paul. Mocha is in use on real-world Rails projects.</p>
 title : The vsftpd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>vsftpd is a GPL licensed FTP server for UNIX systems, including Linux. It is secure and extremely fast and stable.</p>

<p>Despite being small for purposes of speed and security, many more complicated FTP setups are achievable with vsftpd! By no means an exclusive list, vsftpd will handle:</p>

<p>    * Virtual IP configurations
<br/>    * Virtual users
<br/>    * Standalone or inetd operation
<br/>    * Powerful per-user configurability
<br/>    * Bandwidth throttling
<br/>    * Per-source-IP configurability

 title : The PowerTOP Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software component(s) that make your laptop use more power than necessary while it is idle. As of Linux kernel version 2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer tick. This will (in theory) give a huge power savings because the CPU stays in low power mode for longer periods of time during system idle.</p>

<p>Its primary objectives are stability, security, interoperability, and speed, though not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>MyDNS does not include recursive name service, nor a resolver library. It is primarily designed for organizations with many zones and/or resource records who desire the ability to perform real-time dynamic updates on their DNS data via MySQL.</p>
 title : The MyDNSConfig Open Source Project on Open Hub

 title : The ASM Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ASM is a Java bytecode manipulation framework. It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes, directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e., just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.
<br/>ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller (33KB instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation is of the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with SERP). Indeed ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic way* and was therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.</p>
