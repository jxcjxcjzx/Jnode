The developers estimate the effort to complete the stories either at the story level or by decomposing the story into tasks and estimating those. Information about team development velocity from the previous iteration is used to estimate if the team can complete the stories proposed by the customer. If the team appears to be overcommitted, the set of stories are renegotiated with the customer. The XPlanner tool was created to support this process.</p>

By the end of the year, the library had gained so much in popularity that the name was changed simply to Ext, a reflection of its maturity and independence as a framework. A company was formed in early 2007, and Ext is now dual-licensed under the GPL v3 and a proprietary license.</p>

 title : The Scriptorium Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Scriptorium is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write critical editions; it is especially aimed for ancient mathematical texts.</p>

<p>Textual criticism could be broadly defined as a scientific technique for editing a text. The fundamental goal of textual criticism is the edition of a text following very strict criteria of rigour, or reconstructing the text in a form as close as possible to a (lost) original. A critical edition is a complex object, or — better — a complex hermeneutics process in which the editor and the reader are involved; in other words, it should be clear that the editor is making a subjective evaluation of the textual tradition. An electronic-informatic system such as Scriptorium for the creation and utilization of a critical edition can help in making a clear evaluation as far as possible.
