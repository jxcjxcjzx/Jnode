 title : The PPI.pm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Parse, Analyze and Manipulate Perl (without perl)</p>

<p>The ability to read, and manipulate Perl (the language) programmatically other than with perl (the application) was one that caused difficulty for a long time.</p>

<p>The cause of this problem was Perl&#39;s complex and dynamic grammar. Although there is typically not a huge diversity in the grammar of most Perl code, certain issues cause large problems when it comes to parsing.</p>

<p>Indeed, quite early in Perl&#39;s history Tom Christenson introduced the Perl community to the quote &quot;Nothing but perl can parse Perl&quot;, or as it is more often stated now as a truism:</p>

<p>&quot;Only perl can parse Perl&quot;</p>

At whatever level authors program to, they are guaranteed to be using established standards.</p>

 title : The Module::Build Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is pure-Perl and written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don&#39;t even need a shell, so even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its only prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it works fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.</p>

Our motivation to start the development of RAT is that modern remote sensing software like Erdas Image or ENVI include only some basic SAR functionality. Advanced algorithms in SAR polarimetry (PolSAR), interferometry (InSAR) and polarimetric interferometry (PolInSAR) have to be implemented by oneself. So we descided to start the development of RAT. RAT should bring modern SAR algorithms to a wider user-base by simplifying in particular the data handling and processing of complex SAR data.</p>

 title : The Inspekt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Inspekt is a PHP library that makes it easier to write secure web applications.</p>

<p>Inspekt acts as a sort of &#39;firewall&#39; API between user input and the rest of the application. It takes PHP superglobal arrays, encapsulates their data in an &quot;cage&quot; object, and destroys the original superglobal. Data can then be retrieved from the input data object using a variety of accessor methods that apply filtering, or the data can be checked against validation methods. Raw data can only be accessed via a &#39;getRaw()&#39; method, forcing the developer to show clear intent.</p>

<p>Inspekt can also be used on arbitrary arrays, and provides static filtering and validation methods.</p>

<p>Inspekt works in both PHP4 and PHP5, and has no external dependencies.</p>

<p>Inspekt is built upon Chris Shiflett&#39;s original Zend_Filter_Input lib</p>

This includes a data serialization layer to convey the object graphs for the arguments and the eventual response, and an object reference system to keep track of which objects you are connecting to. It uses a capability-based security model, such that once you create a non-public object, it is only accessible to clients to whom you&#39;ve given the (unguessable) FURL. You can also publish world-visible objects.</p>

Its aim is to facilitate a guided brute force attack on a speciﬁc problem of word morphology in computational linguistics: extending the lexicon from corpus data. For a particular inﬂected natural language, it requires a hand crafted SFST ﬁnite state transducer and a seed lexicon covering all of its regular inﬂection classes. When fed with new word forms from a corpus text, it guesses which lemmas could have generated it (induction) and what other word forms could be explained with that lemmas (deduction). This generated data is written to the database and is analysed using SQL to measure the explanatory power of the guessed lemmas with respect to the corpora (abduction).</p>

 summary : <p>Xvid is a MPEG-4 video codec for PC. Its purpose is to compress video in order to allow for faster transmission over computer networks or for more efficient storage on computer disks. Hence, Xvid can somewhat be seen as a ZIP for video. Xvid removes information from video that is not important for human perception in order to achieve very high compression rates while still keeping very good visual quality. As an example: uncompressed digital video is huge and takes up about 100 GB HD space per hour at PAL resolution. The same video would require just 500 MB per hour when compressed with Xvid at high quality. So Xvid can compress video at ratios of 200:1 and more.</p>
