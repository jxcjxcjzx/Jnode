 title : The ngi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NGI is a generic image processing and image analysis library.</p>

<p>Let us dissect the important terms of this definition.</p>

<p>Image processing is the global name for programming techniques that deal with images on input and recreate other images on output.</p>

<p>Image analysis goes a step further in that it tries to extract meaning from an image. Usually the output of an image analysis algorithm is not another image, but some different data, such as the number of objects in an image.</p>

<p>Library is the term for a piece of code that&#39;s available in the form of a toolbox. Software pieces to be assembled by a programmer to fulfill a task. The NGI library is a C++ library available in source code.</p>

<p>Generic is the opposite of specific. </p>

 summary : <p>The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in particular.</p>

<p>Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files.</p>
 title : The Apache Commons Javaflow Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Sometimes it is usefull if we can capture the state of the application, its stack of function calls, which includes local variables, the global variables and the program counter, and save them into an object. If this object would give us the ability to restart the processing from the point stored in it.</p>

<p>A continuation is exactly the type of object that we need. Think of a continuation as an object that, for a given point in your program, contains a snapshot of the stack trace, including all the local variables, and the program counter. You can not only store these things in the continuation object, but also restore the execution of the program from a continuation object. This means that the stack trace and the program counter of the running program become the ones stored in a continuation</p>

 summary : <p>Submarine is a Common Lisp library that&#39;s somewhere between a PostgreSQL library an an object persistency system. It uses Postmodern to communicate with the database. The basic idea is that you create your classes in the metaclass DB-CLASS and submarine cares about creating SQL tables or, if the tables already exist, checking if they conform to the provided specification. Moreover, Submarine supports an intuitive way of expressing both one-to-many and many-to-many relations.</p>
 title : The Submarine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The Postmodern Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Postmodern is a Common Lisp library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. Features are:</p>

<p>* Efficient communication with the database server without need for foreign libraries.
<br/>* Support for UTF-8 on Unicode-aware Lisp implementations
<br/>* A lispy syntax for expressing SQL queries
<br/>* Convenient support for prepared statements and stored procedures
<br/>* Defclass-like definition of tables and associated accessor classes</p>

<p>The biggest differences between this library and CLSQL/CommonSQL are that postmodern has no intention of being portable across different SQL implementations (it embraces non-standard Postgres features), and approaches extensions like lispy SQL and database access objects in a quite different way. This library was written because the CLSQL approach did not really work for me.</p>

 title : The Junction Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When developing PHP applications a great deal of time and effort is wasted writing tedious SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) entities. This situation is exacerbated when working with objects because relational database management systems, with which most persistent storage is maintained, can only store scalar values organized into tables. The developer is responsible for translating objects into a series of scalar values which can be stored in a RDMBS for storage and for translating these scalar values pulled from the RDBMS into an object for reading. This translation process is often very time consuming when approached in an ad hoc manner.</p>
