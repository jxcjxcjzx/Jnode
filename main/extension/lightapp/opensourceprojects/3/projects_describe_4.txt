 summary : <p>ASDF dependency grovel helps you maintain a Common Lisp system that is both easy to develop and speedy to recompile - think of it as a &quot;make depend&quot; for Lisp.</p>

<p>It allows you to keep your system definition in a serial (or condensed) shape, and figures out the dependencies between the system&#39;s components itself. This helps you or your users to incrementally compile the system when files change, without going insane from maintaining tens of compile/load-time dependencies for every file in the system.</p>

 summary : <p>The Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT) is a TCP transaction based query/response protocol that allows a client to access dictionary definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases. dictd(8) is a server which supports the DICT protocol. dictzip(1) is a compression program which creates compressed files in the gzip format (see RFC 1952).  However, unlike gzip(1), dictzip(1) compresses the file in pieces and stores an index to the pieces in the gzip header. This allows random access to the file at the granularity of the compressed pieces (currently about 64kB) while maintaining good compression ratios (within 5% of the expected ratio for dictionary data).  dictd(8) uses files stored in this format.</p>

Enchant steps in to provide uniformity and conformity on top of these libraries, and implement certain features that may be lacking in any individual provider library. Everything should &quot;just work&quot; for any and every definition of &quot;just working.&quot;</p>

 title : The GCC-XML Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Development tools that work with programming languages benefit from their ability to understand the code with which they work at a level comparable to a compiler. C++ has become a popular and powerful language, but parsing it is a very challenging problem. This has discouraged the development of tools meant to work directly with the language.</p>

<p>There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which is currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a C++ program from GCC&#39;s internal representation. Since XML is easy to parse, other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.</p>

It is up to the application developer to provide this sort of integration, as well as any integration with existing code and databases. These may seem like problems to someone who is looking for a quick &quot;plug-and-play&quot; workflow solution, but we&#39;ve found that such a solution never provides enough flexibility to properly fulfill all requirements in a full-blown application.</p>

 summary : <p>Swiftiply is a highly optimized clustering proxy for web applications (currently supports: Rails, Merb, IOWA, Ramaze, Camping, and Nitro, with the ability to support many more). It increases application performance in a few ways. First, it uses EventMachine for network traffic (eventmachine is an event-based asynchronous network library which uses epoll on Linux for high network performance). Secondly, it reverses the way Proxies normally work by letting the nodes in the pool connect to Swiftiply with persistent TCP connections. This removes the delay of having to create a new TCP connection for every request, and makes it easier to maintain your cluster since nodes can be added and removed from the pool simply by starting new processes on a server.</p>

<p>Values are stored persistently on disk by one or more &#39;data stores&#39;, which currently consist of Berkeley DB and SQL servers via CL-SQL. A pure-lisp data store is under development. Elephant inherits the ACID properties of these stores, and by design is transactional, multi-threaded, and in the case of Berkeley DB, process safe.</p>

 title : The cl-utilities Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>On Cliki.net, there is a collection of Common Lisp Utilities, things that everybody writes since they&#39;re not part of the official standard. There are some very useful things there; the only problems are that they aren&#39;t implemented as well as you&#39;d like (some aren&#39;t implemented at all) and they aren&#39;t conveniently packaged and maintained. It takes quite a bit of work to carefully implement utilities for common use, commented and documented, with error checking placed everywhere some dumb user might make a mistake.</p>

<p>The CLRFI process is a lot better thought out, and will probably produce better standards than informal discussion on a Wiki, but it has one problem: at the time of this writing, it&#39;s not doing anything yet. Until the CLRFI process gets going, I think that a high-quality collection of the informal standards on Cliki is a valuable thing to have. It&#39;s here, and it&#39;s called cl-utilities.</p>

 summary : <p>XPlanner is a web-based project planning and tracking tool for eXtreme Programming (XP) teams. XPlanner is implemented using Java, JSP, and Struts, Hibernate and MySQL.</p>

<p>To summarize the XP planning process, the customers pick the features to be added (user stories) to each development iteration (typically, one to three weeks in duration). The developers estimate the effort to complete the stories either at the story level or by decomposing the story into tasks and estimating those. Information about team development velocity from the previous iteration is used to estimate if the team can complete the stories proposed by the customer. If the team appears to be overcommitted, the set of stories are renegotiated with the customer. The XPlanner tool was created to support this process.</p>
