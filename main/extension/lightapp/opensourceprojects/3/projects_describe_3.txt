 title : The Lazy Tagger Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The problem this plugin solves is simple. With the current framework for Joomla 1.0.10 and the current version of xAJAX, only one xAJAX component can run at a time.  If you try to run more than one component that uses xAJAX at a time one will work and the others will not.  This is because the Javascript that powers xAJAX is added to the head of the HTML and doing this more than once will result in duplicate function calls and overridden variables.
<br/> 
<br/>For example.  If you install a commenting component that uses xAJAX in a mambot and a knowledgebase component that also needs xAJAX they both try to add code to the HTML Head tag that powers these features.  One will knock out the other causing sites to not function correctly.</p>

 summary : <p>This XML parser uses the standard XML SAX parser (which in turn uses expat) to provide a SimpleXML-like data model in a streaming fashion. This way, you get the benefit of an in-memory model without having to load a whole document in memory.</p>

<p>To parse a document, you provide a path expression and a callback function. The path expression tells the parser when to use the callback as soon as a tree branch matching the path expression has been parsed. See the example use in the source code.</p>
 title : The PushXML Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The Dadi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Transport Sample Protocol (TSP) goal is to provide a standard interface for data distribution between a provider and several consumers on different hosts, allowing both flexibility and performance aiming at the ease of sampling analysis.
<br/>The TSP protocol, which is based on TCP/IP, allows a client to register to a TSP provider for synchronous (or asynchronous) sample delivery. It permits to select a subset of bench symbols at a selected update frequency.
<br/>The protocol may be used by several TSP consumer (text, graphical, ...) which will use the obtained symbols for real-time or batch display or post-processing.
<br/>Today, this protocol has been implemented as C library based on POSIX calls, running on Linux, Windows, Solaris, OSF1 and VxWorks (provider side only).
<br/>There is a pure Java implementation for the consumer-side too.
<br/>The original need for this project comes from the space industry satellite validation benches. In the use of a validation bench, many parts of the running software and connected hardware should be monitored. This monitoring traces the evolution over the time of huge numbers of parameters at high frequency (example 100 up to 5000 variables at 128Hz). This is the essence of &quot;sampling&quot; bench variables subsequently called bench symbols or sample symbols.
<br/>The different parts of the validation bench may then send a stream of data containing the different values of the queried symbols over time.</p>

 summary : <p>MINIX 3 is a new open-source operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible, and secure. It is loosely based somewhat on previous versions of MINIX, but is fundamentally different in many key ways. MINIX 1 and 2 were intended as teaching tools; MINIX 3 adds the new goal of being usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability.</p>

<p>This new OS is extremely small, with the part that runs in kernel mode under 4000 lines of executable code. The parts that run in user mode are divided into small modules, well insulated from one another. For example, each device driver runs as a separate user-mode process so a bug in a driver (by far the biggest source of bugs in any operating system), cannot bring down the entire OS.</p>
