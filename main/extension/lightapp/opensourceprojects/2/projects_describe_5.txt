 summary : <p>Vis5d+ is intended as a central repository for enhanced versions and development work on Vis5d, a free OpenGL-based volumetric visualization program for scientific datasets in 3+ dimensions.
<br/>This project started out, with the blessing of the original Vis5d developers, as a conversion of Vis5d&#39;s build process to use GNU autoconf and automake. (Inspired by the difficulty of getting Vis5d to compile on the author&#39;s LinuxPPC PowerBook.) It quickly became apparent that many other enhancements were possible, and were of wide interest to users. Moreover, a large number of enhanced versions to Vis5d exist that have not been merged into the original Vis5d sources, due to time and resource limitations of the original developers, or to differences of opinion about design directions.</p>

 title : The IronNails Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IronNails is a framework inspired by the Rails and rucola frameworks. It offers a rails-like way of developing 
<br/>applications with IronRuby and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
<br/>This framework uses the pattern Model - ViewModel - View - Controller (M-VM-V-C). It should be able to run on both WPF 
<br/>and Silverlight.
<br/>The idea is that the views can be created using a design tool like Blend for example and just save that xaml as is. The 
<br/>designer should not need to use anything else than drag and drop to create a GUI design. The behaviors are then added to 
<br/>the view by using predefined behaviors in the framework or by defining your own behavior.
<br/>The framework then generates a proxy for the view which will be used to transparently wire up the commands in the 
<br/>behaviors to controller actions.</p>
 title : The PDF Renderer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The PDF Renderer is just what the name implies: an open source, all Java library which renders PDF documents to the screen using Java2D. Typically this means drawing into a Swing panel, but it could also draw to other Graphics2D implementations. We hope you will come up with cool things to do with it that we never thought of.</p>

<p>PDF is one of the core file formats of the Internet, so it is very important for Java programmers to be able to both read and write PDFs. Great open source libraries like iText have long handled the writing half, but until now there has not been a good way to read PDFs using open source Java libraries. It could be used to draw on top of PDFs, share them over a network, convert PDFs to PNG images, or maybe even project PDFs into a 3D scene.</p>

 summary : <p>From Wikipedia:
<br/>The Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking, or B.A.T.M.A.N., is a routing protocol which is currently under development by the “Freifunk”-Community.</p>

<p>B.A.T.M.A.N.&#39;s crucial point is the decentralization of the knowledge about the best route through the network - no single node has all the data. Using this technique, the need for spreading information concerning network changes to every node in the network becomes superfluous. The individual node only saves information about the “direction” it received data from and sends its data accordingly. Hereby the data gets passed on from node to node and packets get individual, dynamically created routes. A network of collective intelligence is created.</p>

 summary : <p>Java 5 supports reading GIF files. Java 6 also supports writing GIF files. I needed a nice way to write gif images from Java 5. A lot of GIF packages exists for Java 5. But most of them does not give the same nice result as the implementation by Sun. Since I couldn&#39;t upgrade to Java 6 in my project, I backported parts of the javax.imageio package from openjdk-6-src-b09-11_apr_2008 (Can be downloaded from http://openjdk.java.net), so that it can run on Java 5. I&#39;ve introduced new package names, so that this package will not mess with the standard javax.imageio package. Feel free to use it. But remember that it comes with no guarantees!</p>

 title : The MXR Cross Reference Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Mozilla Cross-Reference project is a general hypertext cross-referencing tool with some support for integrating with version control systems and Doxygen. Its main goal is to support Mozilla development and developers. The main feature of the indexer is the ability to jump easily to the declaration of any global identifier or re-search for that as a string. Quick access to function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros makes code browsing more convenient. At-a-glance overview of which code areas will be affected by changing a function or type definition should also come in useful during development and debugging.</p>

 title : The Using IVR and Goolge Calendar to call Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Many people have the experience of using the Calendar,it does facilitate our works and lifes.But most of the Calendars are based on text alert, that means you can only get the reminder event in front of your computer.
<br/>aa
<br/>IVR
<br/>So I think if the Calendar can remind me by phone.If I want to achieve this idea, I need a Calendar that can provide me APIs, a technology that can make me to call through programming.</p>

<p>Fortunately,these technologies for this idea have been provided ,Google Calendar and IVR(Interactive Voice Response, based on phone call).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted some articles to introduce IVR.You can view them here:</p>

<p>IVR used in Voicent Gateway
<br/>IVR used in Facebook</p>
 title : The IVR used in applications Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Interactive Voice Response, [IVR](http://www.voicent.com/ivr.php?a=8223), is a phone technology that allows a computer to detect voice and touch tones. The system based on [IVR](http://www.voicent.com/ivr.php?a=8223) can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct callers. [IVR](http://www.voicent.com/ivr.php?a=8223) enable callers to interact with any software and use the touch-tone pad to input request or just say what then want to do, then the [IVR](http://www.voicent.com/ivr.php?a=8223) will use the text-to-speech software to read information back.</p>

<p>[IVR](http://www.voicent.com/ivr.php?a=8223) is ideal for group event reminders, marketing, lead generation, political campaign promotions, school fundraising, church communications, emergency notifications.</p>
