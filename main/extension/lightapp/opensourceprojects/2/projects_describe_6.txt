 summary : <p>Apache Addressing was an implementation of the Web Services Addressing (WS-Addressing), published by the IBM, Microsoft and BEA as a joint specification, on top of Apache Axis. Version 1.0 of the library was donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which closed the project in 2005.</p>

<p>As of today, a considerable amount of projects depend on this library. Unfortunately, most of them use modified versions, and this produces incompatibility issues that are extremely hard to avoid, even using advanced techniques like classpath concealing. In an effort of integrating several of these projects, I have decided to take this library out from the Apache archives and move it forward to a stable, bug-free version that could be used by any of the affected projects.</p>

 summary : <p>BurstCMS is a content management system intended to be run on PHP 5. The main idea behind BurstCMS is that you have modules and components. Modules are made up out of components.</p>

<p>Components are PHP classes or sets of functions that do small tasks such as parse BBCode. Modules are larger things such as blogs and forums. Modules utilize the functionality in components. So a forum module would utilize the BBCode parser component in order to parse BBCode. A blog can use the exact same BBCode parser to parse BBCode in the blog&#39;s comments.</p>

<p>Modules can share components in order to save space. If you have a traditional forum and a traditional blogging platform, why have two different sets of BBCode parsers?</p>

 title : The pyscd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Maps are often static. As most mapping clients render WMS (Web Map Service) data every time they are queried, this can result in unnecessary processing and increased wait times. GeoWebCache optimizes this experience by saving (caching) map tiles as they are requested, in effect acting as a proxy between client (such as OpenLayers or Google Maps) and server (such as GeoServer, or any WMS-compliant server). As new maps and tiles are requested, GeoWebCache intercepts these calls and returns pre-rendered tiles if stored, or calls the server to render new tiles as necessary. Thus, once tiles are stored, the speed of map rendering increases many times, making for a more seamless user experience.
<br/>GeoWebCache is one of the easiest ways to accelerate your WMS mapping server.</p>

<p>The compiler featured in z88dk is a much enhanced Small C compiler; the compiler accepts many features of ANSI C and is only deficient in a few areas where implementation on a z80 processor might prove inefficient. The compiler performs simple optimisations, but the bulk of the optimisation is achieved by a set of peep-hole rules, which will typically reduce the size of a large project by up to a third.</p>

 title : The action-sms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ActionSMSActionSMS es un plugin para Rails que añade a ActionMailer (el mecanismo estándar de Rails para enviar e-mail) la capacidad de enviar SMS&#39;s, en principio a través de la API de Movistar. </p>

<p>Inicio rápidoEl plugin es bastante simple de usar: </p>

<p>Instálalo: $ script/plugin install http://action-sms.googlecode.com/svn/tags/action_smsCrea el archivo config/sms.yml con el siguiente contenido: gateway: movistar
<br/>login: 
<br/>password: ¡Ya está! Ahora, cuando envíes mensajes con ActionMailer, Rails parseará la lista de destinatarios, y lo enviará como SMS a aquellos destinatarios que consistan en un número, y como e-mail a los demás, de forma completamente transparente. La forma de generar los mensajes, configurar el sistema, escribir los tests, etc., es la estándar de Rails (puedes leer una buena descripción de todos estos aspectos en el capítulo 24 del &quot;Agile Web Development with Rails&quot; o en el wiki de Rails). Enviar SMS&#39;s desde Ruby (sin Rails)ActionSMS se divide en dos partes: la parte puramente Rails de redefinición de ActionMailer, y la clase MovistarGateway que es la que maneja el envío de los SMS. Esto es con un doble objetivo: por un lado, poder incluir en el futuro otros gateways en el plugin (el gateway activo se configura en config/sms.yml y de momento sólo acepta el valor movistar), y, por otro, poder usar esa clase en scripts &quot;pure Ruby&quot;, lo cual sería tan simple como el siguiente ejemplo: </p>

<p>require &#39;movistar_gateway&#39;
<br/>gateway = MovistarGateway.new(&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;)
<br/>gateway.send([&#39;66666666&#39;, &#39;777777777&#39;], &#39;Texto del mensaje&#39;)</p>

 title : The actionconsole Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionActionConsole is a small and effective input/output console for actionscript 3. You can use it in any Flash (9 and up), Flex and AIR project. </p>

<p>The console is a hidden tool that runs inside your project, it can be opened with a shortcut. Opening the console can extend the functionality of your project for debugging purpose or otherwise. </p>

<p>A screenshot of an application with the console opened </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Same application with the console closed </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Input </p>

<p>ActionConsole has input functionality. A user can type text into the console and you can have your application read out this input in various ways. For instance, you could use ActionConsole to tweak a value of some variable inside your application at runtime, or call a certain method when some text is inputted into the console. You&#39;re building a simple CLI into your application in just minutes. </p>

<p>Output </p>

<p>ActionConsole also has output functionality. You can have your application write data into the console, and you can read that data at runtime by just opening up the tool using the shortcut. This makes ActionConsole a powerful debugging tool, no debug player is needed. </p>

<p>StatusActionConsole is currently under development. A somewhat stable beta release is planned. We encourage you to use the latest revision in your project while developing. If you encounter problems please report them, feature requests are also welcome. However, since ActionConsole is not tested enough it&#39;s not recommended that you leave the tool in when releasing your application to the public. There might be some serious CPU or memory issues that we haven&#39;t discovered yet.</p>

 title : The active-support-for-javascript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The focus is to extend the language, modifying the base classes to add several handy methods and shortcuts. It works on top of Prototype and extends the core classes somewhat to the same extent than ActiveSupport extends ruby&#39;s core to make a lot of stuff pretty. </p>

<p>For example, you can do things like: </p>

<p>  (10).minutes().fromNow()             //=&gt; Date object ten minutes in the future
<br/>  &quot;person&quot;.pluralize()                 //=&gt; &quot;people&quot;
<br/>  [&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;].toSentence() //=&gt; &quot;dog, cat and mouse&quot;
<br/>  Date.now().strftime(&quot;It&#39;s %H:%M&quot;)    //=&gt; &quot;It&#39;s 16:23&quot;Plus several other stuff, like string interpolation (a la Ruby), so you get: </p>

<p>  var name = &quot;johnny&quot;;
<br/>  $Q(&quot;Hello, my name is #{name.capitalize()}&quot;); //=&gt; &quot;Hello, my name is JohnnyAnd you can even interpolate inside objects! For example, let&#39;s suppose you have the following class: </p>

<p>  var Dog = Class.create();
<br/>  Dog.prototype = {
<br/>    initialize: function(name) { this.name = name; },
<br/>    woof: function() { return &quot;woof!&quot;; }
<br/>  }</p>

<p>  var bobby = new Dog(&quot;bobby&quot;);You can use interpolation inside the class passing the binding to $Q as a second parameter : </p>

<p>  Dog.prototype.greet = function() {
<br/>    $Q(&quot;I&#39;m #{this.name} and I #{this.woof()}&quot;, this); //=&gt; &quot;I&#39;m bobby and I woof!&quot;
<br/>  }Or you can do this even outside classes: </p>

<p>  $Q(&quot;It&#39;s #{this.getMinutes()} after #{this.getHours()}&quot;, new Date());So whatever you pass to $Q on the second parameter becomes what &quot;this&quot; points to inside the strings. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s a whole other world of stuff for you to discover (and for me --and whoever wants to help-- to document), so check out the code and start marvelling at the flexibility of JavaScript, and the wonders of ActiveSupport ;)</p>

 title : The activemodel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ActivemodelPython already has tons of SQL-wrappers and ORMs and some are quite good. Nevertheless I started my own. Mainly to see if it is possible to implement the API used in Rails. </p>

<p>Some parts required a lot of tricks and magic metaclasses. But in the end it worked well.  </p>

<p>Every model class represents a table in the database. Instances of the class represent rows of the table and the attributes of an instance are the column values of the row. </p>

<p>Unlike other object relationional mappers (ORMs) you do not have to specify the columns in the class. This follows the Don&#39;t-Repeat-Yourself principle (DRY). </p>

<p>Additionsally I added query features as seen in Django, SQLAlchemy and SQLObject. </p>

<p>The only supported database at the moment is MySQL but SQLite and other backends will follow probably. </p>

<p>Unlike Rails activemodel currently provides no mechanism for migration or validation.  </p>

 summary : <p>OverviewActiveUpload is Rails plugin that allows you to quickly and easily accept uploaded files and attach them to any model in your application. It uses a slightly modified version SWFUpload to create an elegant user experience, while at the same time being simple and flexible for the developer. </p>

<p>ActiveUpload also works with ActiveScaffold. See the ActiveScaffold section below for details. </p>

<p>InstallationTo install and and use the plugin, perform the following steps. </p>

<p>First install the plugin: </p>

<p>./script/plugin install http://activeupload.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/activeupload/Second, generate the migration, model and controller </p>

<p>./script/generate activeuploadThird, add the following lines to any model you wish to attach files to: </p>

<p>  has_many :attachments, :as =&gt; :attachable</p>

<p>  def attachment_id=(attachment_id)
<br/>    unless attachment_id.blank?
<br/>      attachments.clear
<br/>      attachment_ids = attachment_id.split(&quot;,&quot;)
<br/>      attachment_ids.each do |a_id|
<br/>        unless a_id.blank?
<br/>          attachment = Attachment.find(a_id)
<br/>          attachments &lt;&lt; attachment
<br/>        end
<br/>      end
<br/>    end
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  def attachment_id
<br/>    result = &quot;&quot;
<br/>    if attachments
<br/>      attachments.each do |attachment|
<br/>        result &lt;&lt; &quot;,#{attachment.id}&quot;
<br/>      end
<br/>    end
<br/>    result
<br/>  endFourth, add the form helpers to your new and edit views: </p>

<p>  
<br/>    Attachments
<br/>&lt;%= f.attachments_field :attachment_id, { :add =&gt; &quot;true&quot;, :edit =&gt;&quot;true&quot;, :filesize =&gt; 30720, :filetypes =&gt; [ &quot;*.gif&quot;, &quot;*.jpg&quot;, &quot;*.png&quot; ] } %&gt;
<br/>  </p>

<p>Fifth, add the view helper to your show view: </p>

<p>  
<br/>    Attachments
<br/>    &lt;%= view_attachments_field(@bench, {})  %&gt;
<br/>  </p>

<p>Sixth and lastly, add the javascript and stylesheets to your layout: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &#39;swfupload_theme&#39; %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag &quot;swfupload_callbacks.js&quot; %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag &quot;SWFUpload.js&quot; %&gt;ActiveScaffoldActiveUpload works well with ActiveScaffold. To get ActiveScaffold to render the correct upload forms you must create a partial form override. Luckily, ActiveUpload comes with one. In the plugin&#39;s public directory ($PROJECT/vendor/plugins/activeupload/public/) you will find a file named attachment_id_form_column.rhtml. Copy that file to your models views directory ($PROJECT/app/views/$MODEL/).  </p>

<p>cp vendor/plugins/activeupload/public/_attachment_id_form_column.rhtml app/views/modelSince attachment_id is a virtual column, you will need to tell ActiveScaffold to use it, you can do that by adding the following code to your model&#39;s controller: </p>

<p>active_scaffold :model_name do |config|
<br/>  config.create.columns = [:column1, :column2, :attachment_id]
<br/>  config.update.columns = [:column1, :column2, :attachment_id]
<br/>endFinally, add the following code to your attachments_controller: </p>

 title : The acts-as-activity-logged Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>acts_as_activity_loggedI needed a plugin which add modified_at, modified_by, created_at and created_by to my models. In general a kind of activity logging. I found Jamie van Dyke Plugin acts_as_activity_logged which was nearly what I&#39;m was searching for. Unfortunately Jamie&#39;s SVN wasn&#39;t accessible and the whole plugin seems to be not well maintained. After some research I found the source code and it wasn&#39;t that sophisticated as I thought. I had some ideas which would improve that plugin and would make more sense at all, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
 title : The acts-as-authentable Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Largely based on restful_authentication by Rick Olson. Changes include: </p>

<p>Bcrypt is used for password storage. Specified with RSpec. Authentication mechanisms are seperated into modules contained within the plugin. Generators are only used for migrations. Does not include email verification. This plugin does not generate controller code for you. Partly because I&#39;m lazy and partly since example code (taken from restful_authentication) can be found in the resources directory of the plugins spec folder. </p>

<p>For a rationale on why SHA1 with individual salts is sub-par to bcrypt read Thomas Ptacek&#39;s article. </p>

<p>ExampleUsing acts_as_authentable is as easy as: </p>

<p>Installing bcrypt-ruby: </p>

<p>  gem install bcrypt-rubyInstalling acts_as_authentable: </p>

<p>  ./script/plugin install http://acts-as-authentable.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/acts_as_authentableAnnotate the model object you want to be authentable: </p>

<p>  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>    acts_as_authentable
<br/>  endCreating a migration for adding fields to the authentable model: </p>

<p>  ./script/generate authentable user</p>

<p>    creates a migration:
<br/>      db/migrate/XXX_add_authentable_fields_for_users.rbIf you have rspec and rspec_on_rails installed verify the plugin with: </p>

 summary : <p>Acts_as_tsearch is a plugin for Ruby on Rails which makes it simple to implement scalable, full text search for Rails if you&#39;re using PostgreSQL as your database. It wraps the built-in full text search engine of PostgreSQL with a familiar &#39;acts_as&#39; implementation. </p>

<p>The primary author Ben Wiseley of ActiveRain explains their motivation:  While scalability problems with acts_as_ferret (likely through our own ignorance) led us to develop this we&#39;d love to thank acts_as_ferret for providing an excellent model on how to do as acts_as_search plugin for Rails and getting us very quickly through our first few months.

 summary : <p>Please note that this project has moved to Github: http://github.com/avdgaag/acts_as_publishable* </p>

<p>Specify this act if you want to show or hide your object based on date/time settings. This act lets you specify two dates two form a range in which the model is publicly available; it is unavailable outside it. </p>

<p>InstallationUse subversion to check out this plugin into your Rails project: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://actsaspublishable.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ actsaspublishableYou can also check out or export stable releases; see http://actsaspublishable.googlecode.com/svn/tags/. </p>

<p>UsageYou can add this behaviour to your model like so: </p>

<p>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  acts_as_publishable
<br/>endThen you can use it as follows: </p>

<p>post = Post.create(:title =&gt; &#39;Hello world&#39;)
<br/>post.published? # =&gt; true
<br/>  
<br/>post.publish!
<br/>post.published? # =&gt; true
<br/>  
<br/>post.unpublish!
<br/>post.published? # =&gt; falseYou can use two special finder methods to find the published or unpublished objects. Use them like you use your standard #find:    </p>

<p>Post.find(:all).size              # =&gt; 15
<br/>Post.find_published(:all).size    # =&gt; 10
<br/>Post.find_unpublished(:all).size  # =&gt; 5Finally, there are scoping methods for limiting your own custom finders to just published or unpublished objects. These are simple wrapper methods for the #with_scope method and hence are used as follows: </p>

<p>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  def find_recent
<br/>    published_only do
<br/>      find :all, :limit =&gt; 5, :order =&gt; &#39;created_at DESC&#39;
<br/>    end
<br/>  end
<br/>endDo note that it is considered poor style to use scoping methods like this in your controller. You can, but always try moving it into you model. </p>

<p>Configuration optionsRight now this plugin has only one configuration option. Models with no publication dates are by default published, not unpublished. If you want to hide your model when it has no explicit publication date set, you can turn off this behaviour with the publish_by_default (defaults to true) option like so: </p>

<p>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  acts_as_publishable :publish_by_default =&gt; false
<br/>endDatabase SchemaThe model that you&#39;re publishing needs to have two special date attributes: </p>

<p>publish_at unpublish_at These attributes have no further requirements or required validations; they just need to be datetime-columns. </p>

<p>You can use a migration like this to add these columns to your model: </p>

<p>class AddPublicationDatesToPosts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
<br/>  def self.up
<br/>    add_column :posts, :publish_at, :datetime
<br/>    add_column :posts, :unpublish_at, :datetime
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  def self.down
<br/>    remove_column :posts, :publish_at
<br/>    remove_column :posts, :unpublish_at
<br/>  end
<br/>end</p>

 summary : <p>Google&#39;s AdWords API service lets developers design computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns. </p>

<p>AdWords API Starter Kit is a framework built on top of the AdWords API. It is written in the Java programming language and uses the AdWords API Java Client Library to communicate with the AdWords platform. This framework allows developers to focus on their business logic by providing a set of high-level classes and functions that encapsulate the details of the AdWords API. The framework&#39;s goal is to take down the wall developers generally face when trying to learn another API. With less time spent on learning the numerous classes and methods of the AdWords API, more time can be allocated towards designing innovative and creative ways of managing AdWords accounts. </p>

<p>FeaturesA flexible and modifiable codebase that can be used as a base for a range of AdWords applications A functioning demo that generates and adds campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords based on a set of products you define An ability to communicate with Production or Sandbox environments An extensive support for logging, down to the SOAP XML level -- AdWords API Team</p>

 title : The aed3-2c-2008 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Trabajos prácticos de la materia., </p>
 summary : <p>A popular approach for developing embedded systems applications is event-driven programming. Most embedded systems employ an event model and inter-process communication protocol in one form or another. In many such systems, the overhead of using an operating system which provides a framework for event-driven programming is unacceptable, in others, it is simply overkill. As a result, a lot of embedded applications use multiple run-to-completion processes implemented as functions being continuously called in a super loop of sorts. Most such implementations require developers to come up with a basic event-based inter-process communication scheme. Quite often such implementations, due to a lack of a well-defined protocol or framework end up producing spaghetti code with a plethora of globally accessible variables and each process using a different communication scheme. AEDEA is presented as an alternative to this approach. Even though the basic idea behind it is the same as the afore-mentioned &quot;super loop&quot;, it significantly reduces code complexity and development overhead and provides a uniform event-based inter-process communication scheme for all processes. It also includes a delta queue implementation of software timers. </p>

<p>AEDEA&#39;s beta version will be available for download by the 2nd week of January.</p>

 summary : <p>AgeFive is a re-implementation of Riven: The Sequel to Myst, working off the same data files. The project eventually intends to cover everything from initial set up to save games. </p>

<p>Naturally, one of the first major milestones to accomplish lies in parsing the Riven Mohawk archive format as well as decoding (and, in some cases, decompressing) the tBMP image, tMOV video and tWAV audio formats, as well as other data. In order to test the feasibility and robustness, smaller apps may be written long before an actual game client: for example, a small utility to extract all images from all Riven data files, working off one and the same backend that would eventually be used for the game application. </p>

<p>With the thinking that performance should not be a major issue, and that the project&#39;s results should be as reusable as possible by others in the future, it is preferred to maximize code readability over code efficiency. That said, techniques will be used to help mitigate some bottlenecks. For example, a Mohawk file&#39;s metadata will only be read once, and stored in a separate file for subsequent cached use, hopefully speeding up access to individual files tremendously. </p>

<p>Much prior research from independent parties is used. Some relevant links can be seen to the side of this page. </p>

 summary : <p>AIMLBot (Program#) is a small, fast, standards-compliant yet easily customizable implementation of an AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) based chatter bot in C#. </p>

<p>Put simply, it will allow you to chat (by entering text) with your computer using natural language. </p>

<p>More info here : http://aimlbot.sourceforge.net/ </p>

<p>What is AIMLbot4Glider: </p>

<p>AIMLbot4Glider is a class you can load in Glider v1.6.8 and up, it will use the AIMLBot technology to pretend you&#39;re a real player in World Of Warcraft(WoW) when gliding. It works with plain Glider Waypoints profiles as well as with PPather tasks. </p>

<p>It is protected under the Glider anti-warden method as it load like any other class. </p>

<p>AIMLbot4Glider does not create responses to say, whispers beside the once set in the options, instead AIMLbot4glider will use AIMLbot to generate a response based on the AIML files in your aiml folder. In other words AIMLbot4Glider is a way to implement AIML into WoW during Gliding. </p>

<p>One of the major advantages of this tool is that you can take over the chat at any moment in time, this can be done remotely by using the MSN network or locally. </p>

<p>Btw: You can control and check the status of Glider remotely as well. (Get screenshots, stats, start stop gliding, chat, and interact with the game directly macros/casting/anything you can control in game with the text interface) </p>

<p>AIMLbot4Glider featuresIt can stops the glide when combat is done send the AIML reply and start the glide again It can send a default response in case AIML does not know what to say It can avoid a whisper loop to yourself It can avoids a &quot;.&quot; (full stop) if that is at the end of the AIML message It can do randomly moves/jumps during the chat too looks live It can blacklist (ignore), players It can show appreciation when you get a friendly heal It can show appreciation when you get a friendly buff It can face (rotate) and approach players AIMLbot is chatting with if close It can respond to say&#39;s when only one player is close, your toon name or when keywords are mentioned It can avoid same message to be send repeatedly It can speak in battlegrounds randomly It can speak in battlegrounds on events It can make random misspellings It can send correction after a misspelling It can respond in a whisper to an invite It can initiate a chat with players watching you It supports several dynamic WoW specific AIML tags (Level, race, etc.) You can control Glider and the chat(if needed) with Windows Live Messenger (MSN) You can manually take over a chat with a person whenever you like (Step in) Configurable responses for appreciations, invites, initiate chat and corrections to misspelling Configurable minimum waiting time between saying thanks (So you won&#39;t spam) Configurable special reply on a GM whisper before hearthstone and exit Configurable random(20%) chat delay to simulate human typing Central AIML improvement options and downloads (Optional) All timings are random Auto update feature General infoFor more information I advice to download the help file, it contains all information you should know before using this class to it full positional. </p>

<p>Interact with the developer on the MMOGlider forum : http://vforums.mmoglider.com/showthread.php?p=1231386 </p>

<p>DownloadGo to the download tab at the top of this Google page and download the binaries. Binaries are ready to use files that are compiled for windows XP and Vista 32 Bit with .NET 2.0 (Same as the Glider requirements) </p>

<p>You can also download the AIMLbot4Glider Setup.exe (Starting version 1.0.9), for a eazy and flawless installation, you only have to select your glider install directory. </p>

<p>Source / SVNSVN checkout http://aimlbot4glider.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/STABLE </p>

<p>When you’re really key on the latest untested features or when you like to advice on changes and the coding, and you know what you’re doing, use the latest beta from the SVN (No support) http://aimlbot4glider.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BETA </p>

<p>Use any SVN client you like, I advice TortoiseSVN.. </p>

<p>DisclamerThe use of this program might be against the terms and conditions of the game manufacture, therefore the use is at own risk. You risk losing your account and all achievements gained in the game. </p>

<p>I really try to limit the risk of having a buggy version out on the internet, but mistakes can always happen, also I am human, and I won’t take responsibility for your lost. The developer(s) are not taking any responsibility.</p>

<br/>	&#39;http://www.example.com/air/MyUpdateableAirApp-%version%.air&#39;
<br/>);
<br/>myUpdater.run();
<br/>Getting startedTo use AirSimpleUpdater, you need to keep two files on your web server: The latest AIR installer archive for your application, and a copy of its application.xml file. </p>

<p>When you release a new version, simply overwrite the application.xml file and upload the new AIR installer archive.  If the filename of your AIR file changes with each version (it contains the version number), then include %version% in your URL (optional). </p>

<p>If the code snippet in the first section is enough of an introduction for you, download updater-1.0.js to get started. </p>

<p>Or, you can download the sample application code and poke around. </p>

<p>To see AirSimpleUpdater in action, install version 1.0 of the sample application.  After launching the application, you will be able to &quot;auto-update&quot; to version 1.1. </p>

<p>If you run into any trouble or have any feedback please email me. </p>

<p>Advanced usageYou may want to provide your own implementation for some of the functions in updater-1.0.js.  For example: </p>

<p>myUpdater.noUpdateRequired = function()
<br/>{
<br/>	alert(&quot;You already have the latest version! Congratulations!&quot;);
<br/>}Or: </p>

<p>myUpdater.whileWaiting = function(status)
<br/>{
<br/>	switch (status)
<br/>	{
<br/>		case &quot;CHECKING_FOR_UPDATE&quot; :
<br/>			statusText = &quot;Checking for update, please wait...&quot;;
<br/>			break;
<br/>		case &quot;DOWNLOADING_UPDATE&quot; :
<br/>			statusText = &quot;Downloading update, please wait...&quot;;
<br/>			break;
<br/>	}
<br/>	document.getElementById(&quot;status_update&quot;).innerHTML
<br/>		= statusText;
<br/>}Some of the other functions you might want to customize: </p>

<p> Function  Returns  Default behavior  Possible customized behavior   noUpdateRequired    Trigger normal program initialization  beforeUpdate  false to cancel update  Asks the user if they would like to update  Force the update  compareVersions  true if update required  Numerically compares version numbers  Compare using your own version numbering scheme  whileWaiting   Changes window title to update status  Show a customized status box  finishedWaiting   Restores window title  Hide customized status box  handleError   Displays error in an alert box  Show a customized error box</p>

 summary : <p>AjaxMessagingDESCRIPTIONAjaxMessaging, or a11g, is a plugin to provide real time messaging (aka COMET) for Ruby on Rails using Ajax and Messaging Oriented Middleware.  </p>

<p>ABOUTAuthor: Francis, Chong E-Mail Address: francis at reality dot hk License: MIT Website: http://code.google.com/p/ajaxmessaging/ Blog: http://www.reality.hk (Chinese Only) DETAILSUsing AjaxMessaging, Rails view can receive real time update from back-end Messaging Oriented Middleware (MOM). </p>

<p>What Happens: </p>

<p>Client open a AJAX connection to Rails Rails connect to MOM using STOMP, listening for specific channels, if there are incoming messages, they are sent to client. If no message for a short period (~30s), the ajax connection return and client try again.    Features: Message sent to client at realtime Only regular HTTP connection is required. No socket server, no hacks on HTTP Pushing. Therefore, most firewall and browser supports it. Subscription to multiple channels. Message can sent to either user or channels. Integrated plugin, simple helper functions.    Requirements: Rails 1.2+ json gem (gem install json) stomp gem (gem install stomp) Mongrel (gem install mongrel), you must use mongrel as web server as AjaxMessaging use Mongrel custom HttpHandler MOM supports STOMP, e.g. ActiveMQ </p>

<p>INSTALLATIONEnter following command in your project:    	script/plugin install http://ajaxmessaging.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/ajaxmessagingEdit config file:      config/mongrel_conf.ymlStart your MOM server. If you are using ActiveMQ, go to AMQ directory and enter following command:      ./bin/activemq  Start rails by enter following command:      mongrel_rails start -C config/mongrel_conf.ymlEXAMPLESYou may get an example project at:

 title : The ajaxslt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AJAXSLT is an implementation of XSLT in JavaScript. Because XSLT uses XPath, it is also an implementation of XPath that can be used independently of XSLT. This implementation has the advantange that it makes XSLT uniformly available on more browsers than natively provide it, and that it can be extended to yet more browsers if necessary. </p>

<p>AJAXSLT is interesting for developers who strive aggressively for cross browser compatibility of their advanced web applications. </p>

<p>This implementation of XSLT operates at the DOM level on its input documents. It internally uses a DOM implementation to create the output document, but usually returns the output document as text stream. The DOM to construct the output document can be supplied by the application, or else an internal minimal DOM implementation is used. This DOM comes with a minimal XML parser that can be used to generate a suitable DOM representation of the input documents if they are present as text. </p>

<p>NOTE(mesch) The world of browser and web applications has moved on since this library was implemented in 2005. Many more browsers now implement XSLT and XPath natively, and, more importantly, fewer web applications use XML as their transfer data format, and moved on to the more appropriate and pragmatic JSON. A simpler more flexible way to bind data to HTML on the browser side for display in web applications is google-jstemplate.</p>

<p>ShareonboxnetThis is a script to capture screen, upload the screenshot to box.net and return you an url to share the new image to your friends. You need ruby, curl, scrot and zenity installed on your system. </p>

<p>To use the script, first get a box.net account, then create a new box.net service. (You don&#39;t need to add actions, we only need a service api key) </p>

<p>After your new service created, download this ruby script http://code.google.com/p/allruby/source/browse/trunk/shareonbox.net/box.rb, filling your api key, login and password to it. </p>

<p>Then just run the script. </p>

<p>You can assign it a key binding, that will make the use of this script more convinient (I bind the script to  on my X61). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t bash me for the dirty code, I just need a work tool :) Too busy to refactor it. </p>

<p>Hint: if you want to edit the image before uploading, just need to add one line to the script.</p>

 title : The amber-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ForewordAmber is an Objective-C umbrella framework which extends the Cocoa API. It functions as my shared source repository, and consists of three frameworks; AmberFoundation which extends the Foundation framework, designed for use in Cocoa daemons; AmberKit which extends the AppKit framework, includes my custom UI controls, designed for use in GUI applications; and Core Networking. </p>

<p>There are a couple of additional frameworks which you are unlikely to use: </p>

<p>AmberKitAdditions.framework, a private framework which is not included in the Amber umbrella. It contains the AppKit extensions without the UI controls. It is a dependency of my custom UI controls when they aren&#39;t being built as part of AmberKit. libAmberFoundation.a which contains most of the AmberFoundation code and is built for use in iPhone applications. </p>

<p>I use the frameworks in my own applications and custom UI controls (take a look at the NSBezierPath+Additions header, there&#39;s some handy drawing methods) and I&#39;d encourage you to take a look through the headers and see if they could save you from implementing something I already have. I refactor any of my common code into the appropriate framework and include useful utilities that I find (and are appropriately attributed) so they are updated frequently. Feel free to use them in your own projects and contact me with any questions. </p>

<p>Using the FrameworkThere are two ways to include Amber.framework in your own project. </p>

<p>The first (and potentially easier) way is to build the sources for Amber. Checkout a revision and make sure that both projects share a build directory, you will need to adjust your build settings if they don&#39;t. Drag Amber&#39;s Xcode project file into your project into the &quot;Frameworks&quot; group (it doesn&#39;t matter where you put it but the &quot;Frameworks&quot; group makes most sense). Once it&#39;s part of your project you need to make it a dependency to make sure it builds before your target. Get-info on your target and select the &quot;General&quot; tab, add Amber.framework to both the &quot;Direct Dependency&quot; and &quot;Linked Framework&quot; sections. The second is to link against pre-built copies of the frameworks. You need to change the &quot;Framework Search Paths&quot; to include the directory where Amber.framework is found. This is probably going to be &quot;$(SRCROOT)&quot; - the quotes are important. Finally, both methods require you to include the framework in your target&#39;s bundle. Amber and it&#39;s constituents are embedded frameworks and must be included in your build product. Don&#39;t install them into a Library directory on the end user&#39;s system </p>

<p>This requires an additional &quot;Copy Files&quot; build phase with the targets &quot;Frameworks&quot; directory as a destination. </p>

<p>ConsiderationsLinking Amber implicitly links AmberFoundation and AmberKit, you only need to include Amber.framework which as an umbrella includes the others. As an embedded framework you must also include the appropriate runpath in your project build settings; this will typically be &#39;@executable_path/../Frameworks&#39; for an Application or &#39;@loader_path/Frameworks&#39; for a Framework. </p>

<p>The frameworks will work in both GC and non-GC environments and are compiled with -fobjc-gc. I&#39;ve tested them using the GC runtime and found no issues. They are also fully  32/64 Bit compatible. The frameworks use the (AFAdditions) and (AKAdditions) category namespaces respectively, ensure this and the methods contained don&#39;t conflict with your own categories. </p>

<p>If you use either of the frameworks, let me know and I can link your page from here. </p>

 title : The ambienttalk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AmbientTalk is an experimental object-oriented distributed programming language developed at the Software Languages Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. The language is primarily targeted at writing programs deployed in mobile ad hoc networks. </p>

<p>AmbientTalk is meant to serve as an experimentation platform to experiment with new language features or programming abstractions to facilitate the construction of software that has to run in highly volatile networks exhibiting intermittent connectivity and little infrastructure. </p>

<p>The language&#39;s concurrency features are founded on the actor model and have been largely influenced by the E programming language. The language&#39;s object-oriented features find their influence in languages like Smalltalk (i.e. block closures, keyworded messages) and Self (prototype-based programming, delegation). </p>

<p>AmbientTalk&#39;s main differences with mainstream languages are that: </p>

<p>It employs a purely event-driven concurrency framework, founded on actors. It abandons the RPC abstraction in favor of asynchronous, non-blocking message passing. Because the system automatically buffers such messages while the receiver of the message is disconnected, the programmer can abstract from temporary network failures by default. It has built-in programming language constructs for objects to discover one another in the local ad hoc network. Peer-to-peer service discovery is built into the language. It features a dynamic OO kernel language built upon the principles of prototype-based programming. More importantly, the kernel language is reflective and hence extensible from within the language itself. The language features both traditional C-style syntax for messaging, as well as keyworded message sends a la Smalltalk. This, together with its lightweight block syntax, allows programmers to easily build their own control structures.</p>

 title : The amse-javascheme Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JavaScheme (summary in Russian)JavaScheme предназначен для построения логических схем исполнения по Java-коду, помогая визуально представить выбранный метод некоторого класса. </p>

<p>Укладка схемы специально создана для языка Java, используя его синтаксические особенности, что позволяет наглядно изобразить порядок и возможные ветви исполнения. Для трех основных типов взаимосвязи между участками кода (вложенность, последовательный порядок в коде, выборочное исполнение) использованы отдельные графические решения, так, например, последовательно идущие секции программы располагаются вертикально, а в случае наличия выборочного исполнения (if, switch, catch-clause) независимые ветви располагаются горизонтально, таким образом, реальный порядок следования исполняемых участков кода будет соответствовать направлению сверху вниз в схеме. </p>

<p>Пользователь выбирает файл, содержащий в себе исходный код интересующего класса, затем выбирает один из классов, объявленных в этом файле, и метод класса для изображения в новой вкладке. Поддерживается сохранение схемы в .jpg, .bmp, .png или .gif. Для удобства восприятия вложенные структуры по желанию пользователя можно выделять рамками.  </p>

<p>Текущая версия программы поддерживает синтаксис языка Java версии 1.6. Поддерживается возможность изображать методы package local-классов, в том числе если их несколько в данном файле; тем не менее, на данном этапе не разрешается просматривать схемы для вложенных классов. </p>

<p>Возможное развитие:• возможность разметки кода специальными тэгами, позволяющими не изображать на схеме отдельные части кода либо сворачивать некоторые части в одно целое; • превращение изображения в динамическое: </p>

<p>• возможность сворачивания вложенных конструкций щелчком мыши по изображенной вершине дерева схемы, 
<br/>• возможность посдвечивания следующей конструкции для конструкций break и continue, 
<br/>• гипертекстовая навигация по вызовам методов (по щелчку мыши по части схемы, соответствующей вызову метода, переходить к схеме для этого метода); 
<br/>• API, поддерживающий динамическую загрузку визуальных форм для конструкций языка; • интеграция в среду разработки (IDEA, Eclipse).</p>

 summary : <p>amumag </p>

<p>An adaptive mesh micromagnetic package. </p>

<p>Uses finite elements to simulate arbitralily-shaped geometries, like rough thin films. Dynamically adapts the mesh resolution to the variation of the magnetization. E.g.: uses coarse cells inside magnetic domains, but very fine cells in the domain walls. Multi-threaded execution takes advantage of multiple CPU&#39;s. Uses the Fast Multipole Method for an efficient calculation of the magnetostatic fields. NOTE: This code is released to the public because it has been used in publications, and we do not wish to present results from &quot;black-box&quot; code. The package is however not yet ready for general use, as it is still being improved and documented. </p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE 2009-11-23: Most of the software on this site has not been upgraded for the latest production releases of the Android platform. Some of the projects have moved on and others have actually seen their lifecycle to the end and have been implemented by Google. If you have any questions about any of the projects on the page feel free to ask. You can find a version of Glance built for 1.0 in the Android Market. Updates to Glance will be coming in the next few weeks and be posted to the Market as well as a Glance project page. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2008-12-17: Logcat has been ported to the G1 devices. Its a simple little apk that pipes the logcat output to the screen for easy viewing. Download the Logcat.apk on the right. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2008-08-18: Most of the code here is currently for M5.  We are working to update certain components to 0.9r1. </p>

<p>Reserved hosting space for a small collection of Android developer examples and general tinkering projects. </p>

<p>Stuff we built to fiddle with Android on the HTC Vogue:vogue-skin: Simple 240x320px Android emulator skin which mimics the Vogue&#39;s display. </p>

<p>Messages: This is a fully integrated threaded text messaging application geared towards the Vogue. </p>

<p>Scribble: A simple text editor to create/modify/view text based files on android. Scribble is also integrated with Glance with a context menu option to open files. </p>

<p>Glance: File manager to facilitate exploring and managing the system and data images from a running device. </p>

<p>HttpDownloader (0.9r1): Android app to download files from the web directly to a running device.  We use this on the HTC Vogue to avoid manipulating the data.img file on the storage card each time we want to test a new APK. </p>

<p>RemoteLogcat: Android app to broadcast the logcat output to a remote server, so that we can watch real-time as we explore applications on the device. </p>

<p>LogcatActivity: Predecesor to RemoteLogcat, allowing you to view the Logcat output on the handset, and optionally save a limited history to a file on the device. </p>

<p>See http://it029000.massey.ac.nz/vogue/ for more information about running Android on an HTC Vogue (we&#39;re using the HTC Touch on Sprint). </p>

<p>Misc. Android developer resourcesaxml2xml.pl: Tool to translate Android binary XML files to plain text XML.  Useful to run over system APKs, and the framework-res package to discover layout voodoo used by the Android team. </p>

<p>aidl-cblistsub.pl (0.9r1): Utility to generate extended RemoteCallbackList classes to ease the burden of implementing callback listeners in a service. </p>

<p>TestKeepAlive (1.0): Sophisticated demonstration of a persistent mobile TCP connection.  The logic here should closely match how Google implements &quot;push&quot; notification of e-mail, calendar, and Gtalk IM. </p>

<p>Solitaire (0.9r1): Simple game implementation demonstrating various Android features, including elaborate custom drawing and state recovery.  Currently plays only Klondike however Freecell and Hearts are coming soon. </p>

<p>JNITest: Working example of JNI on Android, thanks to Davanum Srinivas.  This also serves as a crude benchmark demonstrating the performance overhead of native reads versus a supplied InputStream. </p>

<p>AsyncService: Simple example of how to implement an asynchronous service on Android.  This is old code, maybe even for M3, but the concept still applies. </p>

<p>AlphabetListView: Widget I wrote early on in the development of Five to support alphabet-based navigation.  I don&#39;t intend to use this moving forward, but it does serve as a good, robust example of custom widget creation.</p>

 title : The anti-phishing-email-reply Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTICENOTICE Due to a failure with Google Code&#39;s Subversion service, we are in the process of transitioning this project to SourceForge. </p>

<p>DescriptionThis project is intended to organize email service provider response to email phishing campaigns that convince the end-user to reply via email with their information. </p>

<p>There are many projects aimed at stopping email phishing campaigns, and there are many projects aimed at stopping users from browsing to known phishing web sites.  This project does not aim to solve either of these problems.   </p>

<p>This project was started by email service providers in the higher education IT sector.  Students, faculty and staff have been targeted by phishing campaigns that convince them to reply to email messages with their personal information, most notably their email account password. </p>

<p>The phishers then use the stolen account credentials to send more phishing campaigns using the school&#39;s otherwise trustworthy email system. </p>

<p>The reply address of these phishing messages are usually fake accounts within legitimate email domains, such as live.com or yahoo.com.   </p>

<p>The intent of this project is to maintain a list of accounts that are being used (or have been used) in the reply-to address of phishing campaigns.  Email service administrators can use this list to actively block outgoing smtp submissions destined for these accounts.  The list can also be used to scan recent SMTP logs to determine if any users have already replied. </p>

<p>This project may also be used to host tools to aid in reformatting the list for automatic import into various email server configurations. </p>

<p>DownloadThis is the list of reply addresses being used in phishing campaigns. </p>

 title : The aocchat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionI finally decided to release my Age of Conan port I did of the most popular used chat library to connect Anarchy Online&#39;s ingame chat servers. This PHP library was originally done by Auno and has been used in a number of different public and private development projects for Anarchy Online.  </p>

<p>The chat library on itself cannot do anything. You will have to write your own code that actually use the functionality - or adjust some of the existing Anarchy Online projects to work with Age of Conan. Personally I ported Bebot to work with AoC in very short time. </p>

<p>Changes From Original CodeAll modifications done has been done so the original structure of the library exists. This has been done to make it easier for people to port over any existing Anarchy Online projects they may have running. The only thing that works a little bit different is the buddypackets. Before that only reported online/offline.  In this library you get a status with: </p>

<p>Online/offline status. Level of the character. Location of the user (ID) if the user is online or a timestamp on last online if the user is offline. Class of user (ID) </p>

<p>Class ID can be following18: Barbarian 20: Guardian 22: Conqueror 24: Priest of Mitra 26: Scoin of Set 28: Tempest of Set 29: Bear Shaman 31: Dark Templar 34: Assassin 39: Ranger 41: Necromancer 42: Lich 43: Herald of Xolti 44: Demonologist DownloadYou can download the code from the repository here. </p>

<p>LicenseAochat is distributed under its original GPL v2 license. This means in short that you are allowed to modify and release updates to the library as long as you credit the original contributors. If you release anything using a modified version of this library you have to release the complete source code of your modified library under a GPL v2 license aswell. If you decide to modify the AoC version of the chat library or use it for a project please be kind and notify me by mail so I can keep this library updated. :-)</p>

<p>Tellurium Automated Testing FrameworkLatest UpdateIntroductionTellurium SubprojectsHow to use Tellurium ?Tellurium Maven RepositoryVideos and PresentationsTellurium SupportAcknowledgmentsNews </p>

<p>Latest UpdateTelluriumSource.org is up and running Run Tellurium Integration Tests with Maven Cargo Plugin Tellurium 0.7.0 RC1 is Available Now  Santa: The Tellurium UI Module Group Locating Algorithm How to create your own Tellurium testing project with IntelliJ 9.0 Community Edition What&#39;s New in Tellurium 0.7.0  IntroductionThe Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium) is a UI module-based automated testing framework for web applications. The UI module is a collection of UI elements you group together. Usually, the UI module represents a composite UI object in the format of nested basic UI elements. For example, the Google search UI module can be expressed as follows, </p>

<p>ui.Container(uid: &quot;GoogleSearchModule&quot;, clocator: [tag: &quot;td&quot;], group: &quot;true&quot;){
<br/>   InputBox(uid: &quot;Input&quot;, clocator: [title: &quot;Google Search&quot;])
<br/>   SubmitButton(uid: &quot;Search&quot;, clocator: [name: &quot;btnG&quot;, value: &quot;Google Search&quot;])
<br/>   SubmitButton(uid: &quot;ImFeelingLucky&quot;, clocator: [value: &quot;I&#39;m Feeling Lucky&quot;])
<br/>}The UI module makes it possible to build UI elements&#39; locators at run time. The framework does Object to Locator Mapping (OLM) automatically at run time so that you can define UI objects simply by their attributes, i.e., Composite Locators denoted by the &quot;clocator&quot;. Furthermore, Tellurium uses the Group Locating Concept (GLC) to exploit information inside a collection of UI components to help finding their locators and the GLC is denoted by the &quot;group&quot; attribute in the above UI module.  </p>

<p>The Tellurium framework defines a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for web testing. Still take the above Google search module as an example, you can use the following DSLs to do a Google search, </p>

<p>type &quot;GoogleSearchModule.Input&quot;, &quot;Tellurium test&quot;
<br/>click &quot;GoogleSearchModule.Search&quot;
<br/>waitForPageToLoad 30000One very powerful feature of Tellurium is that you can use UI templates to represent many identical UI elements or dynamic size of different UI elements at runtime, which are extremely useful to test dynamic web such as a data grid. One typical data grid example is as follows, </p>

<p>ui.Table(uid: &quot;table&quot;, clocator: [:]){
<br/>   InputBox(uid: &quot;row: 1, column: 1&quot;, clocator: [:])
<br/>   Selector(uid: &quot;row: *, column: 2&quot;, clocator: [:])
<br/>   UrlLink(uid: &quot;row: 3, column: *&quot;, clocator: [:])
<br/>   TextBox(uid: &quot;all&quot;, clocator: [:])
<br/>} Data Driven Testing is another important feature of Tellurium. You can define data format in an expressive way. In you data file, you can specify which test you want to run, the input parameters, and expected results. Tellurium automatically binds the input data to variables defined in your test script and run the tests you specified in the input file. The test results will be recorded by a test listener and output in different formats, for example, an XML file. </p>

<p>Tellurium UI Model Plugin (TrUMP) is a Firefox plugin to automatically create UI modules for users. In addition, Tellurium provides you the capability to composite UI objects into a Tellurium widget object. You can pack Tellurium widgets as a jar file and then use a Tellurium widget just like a single tellurium UI object once you include the jar file. As a result, Tellurium is robust, expressive, flexible, and reusable.  </p>

<p>In summary, the main features of Tellurium include: </p>

<p>Abstract UI objects to encapsulate web UI elements   UI module for structured test code and re-usability   DSL for UI definition, actions, and testing Composite Locator to use a set of attributes to describe a UI element Group locating to exploit information inside a collection of UI components Dynamically generate runtime locators to localize changes UI templates for dynamic web content XPath support jQuery selector support to improve test speed in IE Locator caching to improve speed Javascript event support Use Tellurium Firefox plugin, Trump, to automatically generate UI modules Dojo and ExtJS widget extensions     Data driven test support  Selenium Grid support JUnit and TestNG support Ant and Maven support The Tellurium Core is written in Groovy and Java. Tellurium Engine and Trump are implemented using JavaScript and jQuery. The test cases can be written in Java, Groovy, or pure DSL. You do not really need to know Groovy before you use it because the UI module definition and actions on UIs are written in DSLs and the rest could be written in Java syntax. Detailed User Guide, Frequent Asked Questions, and illustrative examples are provided. We expect and welcome your contributions. </p>

 summary : <p>About the ToolkitThe Force.com Toolkit for Google Data APIs provides a free and open-source set of tools and services that developers can use to take advantage of Google Data APIs from within Force.com.  </p>

<p>The goal of the toolkit is to make Google Data APIs – starting with Spreadsheets, Documents and Calendar – easy to use from within the Force.com environment.  </p>

<p>The toolkit is modeled after the Java Client library for Google Data, with many of the same class and method names.  In some cases the names have been changed to fit with Apex Code naming conventions. </p>

<p>The Classes found here expose the Google APIs directly within Apex, making it easier to access them natively from Force.com apps and providing tighter integration between the platforms with less developer effort. </p>

<p>For a user not familiar with the Force.com platform, this cloud development platform provides a robust and trusted application development and delivery environment for businesses large and small. </p>

<p>Apex ProgramersFor programmers of Apex Code, there is a wealth of reusable code and great examples of writing Test Methods to achieve high code coverage. </p>

<p>Of particular interest is the XmlDom and XmlDom Element classes, these are reusable in any a number of API integrations, this class has been tested with Google REST, Amazon, RSS and  Ebay API&#39;s to mention a few.  It will parse incoming XML and turn it into an Apex object (DOM) that can be accessed by standard methods like getElementByTagName() and firstChild(), each element contains a nodeValue, sound familiar? </p>

<p>This and much more can be found in the source tree here, drop a note if you would like to contribute! </p>

<p>Share and Enjoy. </p>

<p>::Sobre o Projeto::Reunião inicial 20/08/2008 </p>

<p>A Vertigo Computação foi criada em 1999 e tem foco em sistemas de missão crítica, integração de legados, arquitetura SOA, mapeamento de processos de negócio BPM. Amplo domínio das plataformas JEE5 e BEA. </p>

<p>Em 2005 a Vertigo tinha de 5 a 7 colaboradores. Hoje já são aproximadamente 50 e com expectativa de crescer ainda mais. </p>

<p>Um dos processos que a Vertigo pretende controlar é o de controle de custos e métricas de projetos. O que a Vertigo realmente necessita é de um:  </p>

<p>Sistema de Controle dos Gastos Indiretos em Projetos </p>

<p>Processos que supostamente serão informatizados: </p>

<p>- A princípio, tudo que está relacionado a gastos indiretos dos projetos. </p>

<p>- Solicitação de diárias </p>

<p>- Aprovação de diárias </p>

<p>- Controle do pagamento de diárias </p>

<p>- Solicitação de Vourchers </p>

<p>- Relatórios diversos </p>

<p>Todo gasto está relacionado a um cliente e um projeto. Esses dados servem de base para a Vertigo receber seus honorários. </p>

<p>Na Vertigo, como em muitas empresas de informática, seus funcionários são convidados a permanecerem na empresa até mais tarde. Ex.: Até Às 23:55, sábados, etc. </p>

<p>Restrições: </p>

<p>- Todas as reuniões deverão ser marcadas após  18:00 para facilitar  o acesso aos  interessados. </p>

<p>- A aplicação deverá utilizar banco de dados MYSQL porque eles já possuem softwares internos neste banco de dados. </p>

<p>- Servidor de aplicação poderá ser WEBLOGIC da BEA(a confirmar). </p>

<p>- Plataforma JEE5 </p>

<p>- O sistema vai ter que funcionar perfeitamente para o negócio mesmo que seja necessário cortar escopo ou separar em releases. </p>

<p>- No ambiente de produção, a aplicação deverá rodar em servidor linux com conteiner a ser definido. </p>

<p>Premissas: </p>

<p>- Todos os integrantes poderão ter acesso a Vertigo. </p>

<p>Requisitos não funcionais: </p>

<p>- O sistema deverá suportar navegadores Internet Explorer e Firefox para estações Windows e Firefox para estações Linux. </p>

 title : The apolloim Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Current StatusThis project is no longer the main project of the original developers, we are changing our focus to new software for the official SDK release.  This does not mean we are stopping working, this just means that it isn&#39;t our primary focus.  The full source + lib purple is in the SVN under apollo_1.02.  Since we can&#39;t work on it as much as we&#39;d like, we encourage anyone and everyone to get the source and start working on it.  If you want to see your changes merged back into the main source tree, send it to humajime @ gmail.com.  I&#39;ll be managing the source tree.  When changes are received, I will package them and release new versions of Apollo. </p>

<p>What Is It?Currently, a libpurple based IM client which brings AIM, MSN, .Mac, and ICQ to the iPhone. </p>

<p>Can I Help?Of Course You Can!  We may not be focused on it anymore, but you sure as heck can. It is open source and I am now taking up the role of source manager.. </p>

<p>10/1/2007Version 1.0.2 released. </p>

<p>Unicode Support </p>

<p>10/1/2007Version 1.0.1 released. Here we have some much requested bug fixes: </p>

<p>.Mac support is easier to use.  DELETE your .Mac accounts and add them again! Mysterious double size buddies fixes. MSN login problems fixed to the best of our testing. Conversation with hidden buddies and buddies not on buddy list. Login time improvements. Fixed a handful of crashes. </p>

<p>9/23/2007Well, it tooks us longer, but we decided to tweak until it was perfect.  Welcome to ApolloIM 1.0 - here&#39;s our change log. </p>

<p>Added support for DotMac, ICQ, MSN in addition to AIM.  Through libpurple. Buddylist notification of open conversation Multiple account sign on - I&#39;ve been on 8 accounts at once, although, I wouldn&#39;t recommend more than 2-3 active accounts on edge, otherwise it gets slow real quick Sectioned buddy list by accounts Away / Unaway via the pretty green dot in the upper right.  Tap it, turns red, you&#39;re away.  Tap it again, turns green, you&#39;re back. Support for Alias&#39;d buddy names. Support for Status Messages  - shows up in the buddy list Time Stamps in conversation windows Removed Buddyinfo, for now Preparing to add a pane to &quot;Settings&quot; - eliminates need for &quot;Prefs&quot; button for us, will allow extended user options Completely brand new UI. Entire application is brand new, recoded from the bottom up. Stability should be amazingly enhanced. Wifi Keepalive still requires summerboard.   We&#39;ve tested and retested, and while we could have released days ago we chose to keep piling on as many features as we could.  So here you go, the fruit of our labors. </p>

<p>While you&#39;re at it, check out our new homepage - we&#39;re coming up in the world.  We&#39;ll still call our googlecode page home for our svn, but apolloapp will be used to announce more releases and hopefully soon provide more detailed information about features and the like.  Check it out. </p>

<p>9/17/2007Hey guys - just wanted to chime in and say we haven&#39;t forgotten you.  We&#39;re hard at work on 0.2.0, and we&#39;re close to a release.  It&#39;s our most feature packed version yet, better stability, keepalive works pretty well, and we&#39;re adding most of the protocols people have been requesting.  We&#39;re hoping to clear out the issues page :) </p>

<p>As for now, hang tight.  We don&#39;t want to put out any screenshots or anything until our release - we have some surprises in store :) </p>

<p>Until then, feel free to email us - arminius2@gmail.com - and once again, thanks for your support.  Really, you&#39;ve kept us coding and we&#39;ll keep pioneering as long as there is community support.  Thanks guys, really. </p>

<p>-- Quick update - I&#39;ve personally been involved with the iPod touch hacking team, and well, the second we&#39;re inside the touch we&#39;ll have an Apollo client ready. </p>

<p>9/9/2007BETA 0.1.2 is out - here&#39;s the changelog -  </p>

<p>Loads of stability fixes!  Removed options button in favor of using the ringer button.   Ringer button dictates vibrate or playing sounds New Sounds, only send/recv, but much more pleasant Fixed Conversation window sometimes not responding after resume from suspend Fixed &quot;Disconnect not disconnecting&quot; Added Wifi Keep Alive If you are using SummerBoard, the latest version now works with ApolloIM to not turn off   Wifi.  There is no reconnect support yet, but this is a solid feature.  Note: This will drain your battery much faster because Wifi is kept on while in lock while ApolloIM is running.  But it works pretty great and the drain seems to be manageable Does not vibrate on send.  In other news, we&#39;re gearing up for libpurple.  We don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll feel confident to release our work, but we do have a test client that can sign on to aim / msn / jabber.  It&#39;s not pretty yet and not all of the dangly bits are hooked up - but we&#39;re pretty happy with our progress.  Special thanks to the Adium Team as well as Sean Egan for pointing us in the right direction a few times.  There&#39;s no set timeline for when it will be ready, but as soon as we&#39;re sure it&#39;s solid, we will release it.  The release of libpurple will start the 0.2.0 versions. </p>

<p>As soon as we&#39;re sure libpurple is working great, we&#39;ll bump our version up to 1.0 :) </p>

<p>Enjoy the new beta, and please, if you have any feedback - arminius2@gmail.com  - We&#39;re also going to have a site ready for you very soon.   </p>

<p>9/4/2007Released BETA 0.1.1 to fix a couple small things.  Preferences weren&#39;t sticking but should now, and back on Preferences takes you back to the buddy screen.  Badges should work better now. </p>

<p>9/3/2007Well, we&#39;ve released BETA 0.1 - that&#39;s right folks, we&#39;re above Zero.  The stability in this version is far superior, and I believe that it&#39;s actually ready for &quot;Use.&quot;  We&#39;ve piled through the issues and fixed as many bugs as we could have, and for being barely a week old, I think we&#39;re doing amazing things.  We have also just gotten, as of today, libPurple fully compiled and the nullclient/ncurses client (Finch) working, and so you can expect support in the near future for MSN/Yahoo/Jabber/Gtalk and as many others as we can get linked - special thanks to Core &amp; Nightwatch for working hard on that. </p>

<p>Since last week we&#39;ve implemented a host of changes - mostly at the request of people like yourself.  So please keep filing &quot;Issues&quot; and if you&#39;ve got a comment on a build or would like to say thanks - feel free to email the team (emails at the right). </p>

<p>Notable Fixes: -Conversation Windows&#39; scrolling is a lot smoother and works a lot more reliably (Fixed by moving to a UIScroller) </p>

<p>-Defaults back to the send box after sending a message (was the conversation window. Fixed by moving to a UIScroller) </p>

<p>-If you are disconnected, your password is wrong, or you chose to disconnect - it will not close ApolloIM.  You&#39;re free to select another account or change your pass and then reconnect. </p>

<p>Firsts: -First application to implement Edge Keep Alive - found method in NetworkController.h that  should bring Edge up if it&#39;s down as well as keep edge alive while in suspend.  This however does not apply to Wifi yet - wifi is seemingly controlled by Springboard, and when springboard suspends at lockdown it will bring this down.  We&#39;re on the lookout for getting a springboard hack implemented (a la summerboard), and as soon as we get something we&#39;ll implement it asap.  For now, assuming you&#39;ve got plenty of bars of coverage, Edge will stay connected.  I would warn you that there is the chance you will miss a call / text message, but every time I have received a text/call while on ApolloIM (on Edge), it has exited Apollo and allowed me to take the call.  Will require much testing. </p>

<p>-First application to implement vibration.  Admittedly, it&#39;s a dirty hack right now - but our buddy pumpkin in #iphone-uikit has come through and found a way to get vibrate working.  You can turn it on and off (Along with sound!) at your discretion. </p>

<p>Other New Features: -Buddy info works, but isn&#39;t pretty. -Delete button for Accounts -UI Badges like Mail/MobileSMS for unread messages </p>

<p>What sort of works: -Sound is kind of wonky at moment.  For example, if you&#39;re playing a song on the iPod  and you get a message while sound is on, it will pause your song and not resume.  We haven&#39;t figured out yet how to send the notification to turn it back on.  For now, I would recommend that you keep sound off while you intend to listen to your earphones and just use vibrate. </p>

<p>9/1/07Fixed edge / &quot;Generic Error&quot; problems.  Turns out the iPhone&#39;s DNS resolver is royally f&#39;d and the new Firetalk didn&#39;t like it, but I have remedied this for now by just popping the raw IP into the server host field. </p>

<p>This should fix the immediate issues that cropped up from last release.  Notably &quot;Generic Error,&quot; and this will also be the last release  until Monday night where I endeavor to clear out the &quot;Issues&quot; page.  Several dev&#39;s are getting ready to do  branches with sound/vibrate updates and I&#39;m personally gearing up for a real &quot;suspend&quot;.   </p>

<p>Special thanks to the dude at the Apple Store in boulder who had ApolloIM on his phone.  It was really rad seeing that. </p>

<p>Gizmodo, I&#39;m hoping for a &quot;ApolloIM One Week Later:  85% less suck on the road to Beta&quot; Tuesday morning. </p>

<p>9/1/07Wow, 7300 downloads last night.  That&#39;s really nuts.   </p>

<p>Truth be told -.8 was just a quick fix for the buddy list, today I will be releasing a proper implementation (working on it right now, 10am on a Saturday morning).  I would hold off until Early Sunday morning if you haven&#39;t upgraded yet. </p>

<p>8/31/07Negative .8 is up and the buddylist should be fixed and there should be far less crashing.    Before you sign on, I advise you to set your account to inactive, save, then go back and set it as active.   </p>

<p>Note:  Edge does not work in this connect.  It will be fixed Saturday  - Sept 1st - with version negative point seven five.  New firetalk is too fast, interface doesn&#39;t have a chance to come up. </p>

<p>8/30/07Firstly,  I want to thank the person who donated $300 to the new team.  These kind of donations keep me working hard, and now that we have a real team coming together, will keep us focused. If you wish to help out, every little bit helps, and will be used 100% towards materials needed while coding.  Just contact us and we&#39;ll set you up with our paypal information. </p>

<p>Now, on to the news... </p>

<p>Suspend support is partially working.  You can go and use other programs, and ApolloIM will still stay open.   </p>

<p>The main problem with suspend is that the iPhone goes into a low power mode when shoved into your pocket waiting for a call - and this mode will shut off edge / wifi.  Simply pinging the server won&#39;t keep the wifi up, as it seems the kernel does its best to plain unload it.  I don&#39;t know what the prospective fix for this, one idea would be to move to a client/remote daemon, which would mean you would run a client on your home computer which would record all the incoming messages to you and send it over to you (and when your phone goes off, you&#39;d still be on, because the daemon is still running). </p>

<p>Suspend as whole, however, should work while you&#39;re playing music.  If you&#39;re playing a song while ApolloIM is on and in your pocket, it will keep the iphone active enough to keep the program connected.  The trick for me here is to find how exactly Apple does that, and well, I&#39;m on the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also improved the Conversation window, at the cost of making the Send button uglier - if you have problems with the send button, aim for hitting the &quot;text&quot; on the button.  You no longer can type in the main window, and I may release another update very soon to use &quot;text bubbles&quot; like iChat uses.  I have removed the keyboard button in favor of just being able to tap the main view to bring up the keyboard (or you can tap the sendfield at the bottom which,like MobileSMS, will bring up the keyboard). </p>

<p>This will be the last update for a while.  I have been working alone on this project since it&#39;s beginning, but the team has started to come together.  It was kind of funny to see people say &quot;The ApolloIM team&quot; when it was just me, but thanks to my initial release, I&#39;ve gotten some star players to help out.  Notably Dankow who will be working on the interface and keeping code tidy, and Core who has stepped up to help us get libpurple worked out.   If you know libpurple well, and would enjoy helping us integrate it, please send me an email at arminius2@gmail.com . </p>

<p>LibPurple will enable us to have Yahoo, MSN, Jabber, and GTalk support when we get it ready, as well as fix the &quot;Buddy&#39;s not showing up&quot; error.  I suspect my current implementation of libfiretalk is bugged, and I can either work on exchanging it for a different version or get purple working an adding support for the other services.  I&#39;m told one solution could be for you to create a new screen-name and import your buddylist with a &quot;real&quot; client, and then not to change the formatting of any names.  It&#39;s cumbersome, but until we get Libpurple working, it&#39;ll have to do. </p>

<p>8/27/07Fixed suspend support.  ApolloIM will keep running now if you press the homebutton.  SVN is up, binary may be up tonight.</p>

 summary : <p>ENThe goal of this project is to create a minimum application that  goes beyond the Django tutorial and shows you how to use some of the normal practises you could find in a real application. </p>

<p>Some of the examples are also part of a blog post at http://trespams.com, my blog about Python and Django. The blog is in catalan, but it provides authomatic translation :) </p>

<p>Other samples comes from user request or from prototypes we have made at http://apsl.net our consulting Django company. </p>

<p>CAL&#39;objectiu d&#39;aquest projecte és crear una aplicació mínima que vagi un poc més enllà del tutorial de Django i mostri algunes de les pràctiques més habituals que hom es pot trobar en aplicacions reals. </p>

<p>Alguns dels exemples serveixen de suport a algún post del meu blog a http://trespams.com, per il·lustrar algún concepte de Python i Django. </p>

<p>Altres exemples provenen de prototis que hem anat fent a http://apsl.net, la nostra empresa consultora de Django i que hem trobat prou interessants i senzill per a posar-los aquí. </p>

<p>How to run the examplesOn each folder you&#39;ll find an example which shows a &quot;how-to-do&quot; feature. To test it just copy/rename properties.py.template to properties.py, modify it to fit your needs (99% of time it would be ok) and run python manage.py runserver </p>

<p>Sample applicationsproject: start your project with this scheleton. ajax like tail (for log display) Use imagekit : upload your images and create thumbnails with imagekit, a practical example. upload images to a database in batch mode. performance test to compare with php. To support http://trespams.com/2009/05/10/django-vs-php-framewors/ post. appagenda : Its a minimum application with html CRUD. Show also how you can use extjs to display a table and how to use jqgrid 3.2 to get the same as in extjs. Incluses extjs and jqgird libraries. I have had to patch jqgrid adding   if(ts.p.jsonReader.cell) cur = cur[ts.p.jsonReader.cell];  the patch has been sent to jqgrid author but not feedback has been received. </p>

 summary : <p>Anyone who at least once lost his project knows – I personally do - how important it is to create backups. Rdiff-backup (http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/) allows user to incrementally backup one directory into another. Increments make disk usage relatively low, as only differences between two consecutive backups are stored. This has its drawbacks, however. Although user can access files from most recent backup easily, simply by entering the backup directory, it is much harder to access and browse through older versions. Rdiff-backup allows to access them only by set of instructions, that require precise knowledge of file names and backup times. To investigate creation process of certain project one has to invest a lot of time and energy. This reduces rdiff-backup directory to simple copy of a project rather than repository of all its versions. </p>

<p>Possible solution is to create userspace filesystem based on rdiff-backup repository data. As these information are well and explicitly stored, they can be easily accessed by the filesystem and presented to user in clear and friendly manner. Instead of doing a lot typing and bookkeeping, user will be able to freely browse through any revision of the backed up directory. </p>

<p>The easiest – in my opinion – way to create one, is to use FUSE (Filesystem in userspace - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) library that allows the developer to focus on high level aspects of the filesystem (e.g. Accessing rdiff-back information and files), while it does all the necessary low level work itself. Since using FUSE does not require root privileges it can be used by any user to create personal filesystem on demand. </p>

<p>As soon as filesystem is correctly mounted, it will provide access to snapshot of the repository for every increment that had been done. Directory structure will be the same as the backed up directory at the time of the increment. Any file added to the repository at the will be accessible, yet only the accessed files will be replicated, so disk space usage stays low. </p>

<p>Latest version of archfs works with rdiff-backup 1.0.x and 1.1.x. </p>

<p>Idea for this filesystem was first presented by Lukasz Sznuk from University of Warsaw as one of the projects for course in Operating Systems.</p>

 summary : <p>Arcus is a raytracer designed to trace images in arbitrary cordinate systems (i.e. taking into account the effects of general relativity). </p>

<p>NewsAt the top of the news, for the duration: Currently, there&#39;s nothing here in terms of web page.  The progress of the system overall may be somewhat tracked by consulting the Arcus documentation book.  This link points to the SVN trunk, and as such might possibly be either relatively out of date or full of wild code which will in future be abandoned. </p>

<p>October 2, 2008: The first images from Arcus have been produced, and are available for consumption here just down the page! </p>

<p>ImagesA few images, indeed, exist! </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This was the first successful rendering created by Arcus -- it&#39;s nothing more than a drawing of the YZ plane (i.e. a solid color field).  The atlas contains only flat space, and the camera is positioned down the X axis. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This was the first rendering of a proper scene -- it&#39;s a sphere of radius ~2.8, centered about the origin, once again rendered in flat space, with the camera at a distance of 10 units along the X axis from the sphere.</p>

 summary : <p>UPDATEGFT technique works on Archos 604, 605, and 705 wifi models You can download a kitchen sink rootfs build (everything I could get to compile out of the Archos GPL tarball out of the box) from http://www.remix.net/archos/ax605_rootfs.tar.bz2 You can enable scp/sftp by either fixing the config to reference sftp/ssh from /tmp/ssh, or just hex edit the defaults in sshd. I haven&#39;t made this change in arcwelder-1.0.zip, this change will be made and a new archive will be uploaded (soon?). WARNINGThe techniques and software provided in this project are dangerous to the well-being of your Archos if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. If you&#39;re not comfortable in a Unix/Linux environment, DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE. You will brick your Archos and have nobody to blame but yourself.  </p>

<p>In using these techniques and software you assume all risk and hold harmless the arcwelder project and myself for any damages real or imagined. Don&#39;t go crying to Archos either, it&#39;s not their fault. </p>

<p>To make things even more interesting, I&#39;ve haven&#39;t tested things rigorously. Scared yet? You should be! </p>

<p>Nathan Ramella, n ar @ h u sh.com </p>

<p>SummaryThrough a technique dubbed &quot;Go Fighting Tabby!&quot;, or GFT for short, you can gain root access on an Archos 605 wifi running 1.7.13 firmware and execute arbitrary programs in its embedded Linux environment.  </p>

<p>This is the first step to gain access to the running Linux operating system, which until now has not been possible. </p>

<p>Using the GFT technique, you can install the &#39;ARCwelder&#39; package which will allow you to ssh into the Archos 605 wifi and run unix commands from a shell.  </p>

<p>Currently ARCwelder only provides an ssh package, however in time more packages may be included as they are tested and verified as working, some customization is necessary to ensure that they work on the embedded system, so the term &#39;hack&#39; is definitely applicable. </p>

<p>Go Fighting Tabby! Technique ExplainedThe GFT technique is pretty simple, after auditing the GPL tarball from Archos, I found a script named &#39;smbpasswdhelper&#39;. </p>

<p>smbpasswdhelper </p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>if test $# -ne 2
<br/>then
<br/>        echo &quot;usage: $0 account password&quot;
<br/>        exit 1
<br/>fi</p>

<p>/opt/usr/bin/smbpasswd -x $1</p>

<p>/opt/usr/bin/smbpasswd -s -a $1 &lt;&lt; EOF
<br/>$2
<br/>$2
<br/>EOFWhat got me interested was that it didn&#39;t quote $2, I figured $1 would be hard-coded to whatever the smb user is for connecting (guest maybe?), so I started poking it a bit. As it turns out, that wasn&#39;t even necessary, as I believe the avos application is doing a straight system call without sanitizing the user supplied password string.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re at all familiar with shell commands, the prospect of an unsanitized string being used in a system() call is pretty attractive from a hacker&#39;s perspective. It means by using a little shell trickery you can launch your own command. </p>

<p>But how do you use this script? </p>

<p>That&#39;s the nice part, the Archos UI has provided you a text box to type in whatever you want for the &#39;password&#39; under the wifi settings, after you&#39;ve connected to a wifi network. You can set the password and launch an smb server, in doing so the smbpasswdhelper script is run (along with your hijack command). Even better, it runs your command as root, so you&#39;ve got full privileges from the start. </p>

<p>GFT Technique AppliedConnect to a wifi network From the top level of the avos app, goto your wireless settings again, this time you should see your IP address and other network configuration information. Scroll to the bottom and select Wireless File Server.. Setup your Samba info as you like, but select the Password setting to bring up the keyboard UI. Change the password to &quot;1;ls -laR / &gt;/mnt/data/Data/file_list.txt&quot; , include the quotes, that&#39;s important Click/Run Enable File Server After a couple seconds, the UI will notify you that the fileserver has started, that means your command has run.  Pop back up to the top level of the UI Select the Files icon by double clicking it Browse to Data, you should see file_list.txt, you should be able to read the file by clicking it (If you have the Opera web browser, if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll need to attach your Archos to a computer and read the file that way), inside file_list.txt will be a full directory listing of your Archos device. You can run any supported Unix command using this technique, this gives you direct access to the &quot;hidden&quot; Linux partitions. This technique can be used to run / install other scripts, but if you install ARCwelder, you can just ssh in and do it that way. The Archos is set to power down the wireless whenever it can, so you may get disconnected if there&#39;s no activity. Since the archos support library is included in the GPL tarball, this may have something in it to hard-code longer timeouts. Installing ARCwelderDownload ARCwelder-1.0.zip  Connect your Archos 605 wifi to your computer, select hard drive mode Mount your Archos on your computer Unzip the contents of ARCwelder-1.0.zip into /Data/, this will make a directory named &#39;arcwelder&#39; and populate it with the necessary files. When complete you can verify this step by checking /Data/arcwelder/ and make sure that your file list matches the MANIFEST.txt file. Copy /Data/arcwelder/id_arcwelder into ~/.ssh/ on your client machine if you&#39;re using OSX or Linux, if you&#39;re using Windows download PuTTY and use that. id_arcwelder is a password-less RSA key. For instructions on using PuTTY check out the wiki entry How_to_use_RSA_keys_with_Putty DO NOT install id_arcwelder.pub into your ~/.ssh/ directory.  Use the GFT technique to run this command &quot;1;/bin/sh -x /mnt/data/Data/arcwelder/install&quot; , if you have trouble and need some debugging information you can GFT &quot;1;/bin/sh -x /mnt/data/Data/arcwelder/install 1&gt;/mnt/data/Data/stdout.txt 2&gt;/mnt/data/Data/stderr.txt&quot; , this will save both the standard output and standard errors into files so you can see what happened. A typical &#39;good&#39; stderr file will look something like this: + mkdir /tmp/ssh/
<br/>+ mkdir /tmp/empty
<br/>+ chmod 755 /tmp/empty
<br/>+ cp /mnt/data/Data/ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/data/Data/ssh/fix /mnt/data/Data/ssh/id_archos /mnt/data/Data/ssh/id_arcwelder.pub /mnt/data/Data/ssh/sftp-server /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh-keysign /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_banner /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_config /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_key /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key /mnt/data/Data/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub /mnt/data/Data/ssh/sshd /mnt/data/Data/ssh/sshd_config /tmp/ssh/

<br/>+ chmod 4711 ssh-keysign
<br/>+ chmod 600 /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_key /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
<br/>+ chmod 600 /tmp/ssh/authorized_keys
<br/>+ chmod 644 /tmp/ssh/id_arcwelder.pub /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub /tmp/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
<br/>+ /tmp/ssh/sshd -f /tmp/ssh/sshd_configUsing ARCwelderConnect to your wifi network using the instructions found on page 42 of the Archos User Manual.  Use the GFT technique to run the install script.  Once ARCwelder is installed, and you have installed the private RSA key on your client machine, connect your Archos 605 wifi to your wireless connection, Find_your_Archos_IP_address and then run &#39;ssh -l root &#39;, you should be greeted with the following banner and login prompt: $ ssh -l root 192.168.1.120

 summary : <p>Arid POJOs is a framework for simplifying POJO application development. </p>

<p>Automatic Spring Bean GenerationArid POJOs provides a custom Spring/XML namespace that scans a package hierarchy and generate bean definitions for the classes or interfaces that it finds. The classes and interfaces can be filtered by an AspectJ type pattern, which supports various criteria including name matching, annotations, and subtypes. The generated beans use autowiring. Here is a simple example. </p>

<p>...
<br/>     
<br/>...
<br/>The generated bean definitions can also instantiate an entirely different class. The original interface/class is passed as a constructor argument. This is used, for example, with the dynamic Generic DAO feature. </p>

<p>Dynamic Generic DAOsArid POJOs can also generate DAO implementations from an interface using a Grails GORM/Rails Active Record like mechanism. Here is an example interface: </p>

<p>public interface CustomerRepository extends GenericDao {
<br/>	Customer findByCustomerId(String customerId);
<br/>	Customer findUsingSomeStrangeNamedQuery(String firstName, String lastName);
<br/>}Arid POJOs will generate a proxy, which implements this interface. The findByCustomerId() method is turned into Criteria Query, which searches on the customerId property, and the findUsingSomeStrangeNamedQuery() method ends up calling a named query. This is accomplished using the following bean definitions: </p>

 summary : <p>This is a naive Bayesian text classifier that, given a bit of text can tell you the posterior probability (returned as a log likelihood) that it comes from each of the standard scientific article sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion). </p>

<p>What do we mean by a bit of text, well anything you want really, from a few words to a whole article, you decide on the boundaries. </p>

<p>You can use it to:Pull out all the bits of text from an article that are from your chosen section. Score each bit of text in 4 dimensions (i.e. how introductory, methodological, results-based or conclusionary it is) which may be useful for finding similar text. Use it to create training data etc. This project contains:A local version of the classifier, for better performance (see Downloads, or choose a version from the downloads list to the right) Links and info on how to access the web service interface to the classifier (see below) Example client software Ruby and Perl for accessing the web service from your code (see Downloads) Some Taverna workflows that give a demonstration of how to use the classifier web service (coming soon) The training data (useful for error analyses) datastore.dump A user guide for the web service (coming soon) Some javadoc describing the code for the web service interface and its associated bean classes. ArticleSectionClassifier-1.0-javadoc.zip Test the classifierYou can test the classifier through your browser here </p>

<p>Download the classifierDownloads are all listed here or you can see the featured downloads on the right hand side of this page.  </p>

<p>SOAP/WSDL Web ServiceThe wsdl document for the web service is here and you can test it directly through your browser here.  You can also download local clients in Java, Perl and Ruby for accessing the web service. </p>

<p>Using the classifier in JavaFirst you must include the ArticleSectionClassifer.jar file in your classpath.  Secondly it is best to increase the memory allocated by the Java executable using the -Xmx Java VM argument, I usually suggest -Xmx256m.  Then you can use the classifier in few lines of code. </p>

 summary : <p>What is AS-HIVE? </p>

<p>AS-HIVE allows developers to rapidly build applications and games that rely on state, event, and load management of external media files. </p>

<p>We&#39;d like to foster a collective of creative people who design and develop primarily using Adobe&#39;s Flash. We encourage input and participation from all ranges of people who code in Actionscript. </p>

<p>Hard core developers may be interested to know that AS-HIVE is built on a state-based MVC framework but you don&#39;t have to be a hard core developer to use it.  </p>

<p>Intermediate developers who don&#39;t wish to advance the framework can try the samples so that one can see how to save time and energy allowing AS-HIVE to handle loading your external assets like xml, pngs, flvs and mp3s. AS-HIVE also helps you animate screens by creating sequences that build up and tear down before moving to the next state.  </p>

<p>By integrating other open source projects like Tweener and Papervision3D, AS-HIVE offers a robust and reliable mechanism for manipulating 2D and 3D content allowing the developer to focus on architecture and flow. </p>

<p>How do I learn about AS-HIVE? </p>

(2008-04-22)Read this blog post to see how I&#39;ve decided to circumvent AS3&#39;s un-RESTful-ness :  http://blog.martinlegris.com/?p=92 . This is good news, within a week you will have access to the full scope of the youtube data api! (except uploading videos... which will come later). </p>

<p>Important information about supporting the new featuresI have tried, a month ago when the new API rollout happened, to implement the new features offered. However I ran into limitations of AS3 &amp; Flash CS3. Here are the details: http://code.google.com/p/as3-youtube-data-api/wiki/LimitationsOfCS3 </p>

<p>DetailsThe library is based on a singleton Client called YouTubeClient.  It provides feeds and iterators to go through the information received from the YouTube Data API.  These iterators return hard-typed data objects which you can explore easily using your auto-complete IDE such as FlashDevelop, Flex IDE, Eclipse w/FDT, Intellij Idea or other. Each request sent through is identified by a requestId which you can use to filter the different responses you receive, ensuring you do manipulate the expected data. Tutorials &amp; Samples2008-03-28 A new tutorial was posted on the google code website here: http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=92715&amp;topic=12359. The first tutorial was posted here: http://blog.martinlegris.com/?p=83 Some explanations on which events are thrown in which context by YouTubeClient can be found here: http://blog.martinlegris.com/?p=84 Another sample, this one to consume a standard feed is shown here: http://blog.martinlegris.com/?p=81 Help NeededAlthough i&#39;ve done a lot of testing, I realize it can be buggy. I would also need some help to document this beast of 35+ classes. If anyone is interested please let me (Martin) know. Hope you enjoy it! </p>

 summary : <p>A project to handle Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase) files for Actionscript 3.  My use is for writing files with AIR, but since it&#39;s built to handle ByteArrays sending and receiving from a server would also be viable.</p>
 title : The as3awss3lib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an AS3 library for accessing Amazon&#39;s S3 service.  It only works in Apollo because of restrictions in the browser player. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty comprehensive.  It supports managing buckets and objects.  I haven&#39;t implemented some of the access control stuff yet, or the bucket listing pagination features.  These are trivial to add -- I just haven&#39;t found the time yet.  The hard part (the protocol) works perfectly, so adding functionality is pretty straightforward. </p>

<p>This library has the following dependencies: </p>

<p>As3Crypto (http://crypto.hurlant.com/) </p>

<p>as3corelib (http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/) </p>

<p>The free Flex SDK (http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/sdk/) </p>

<p>There is currently no zip archive available.  Please check the code out using subversion.</p>

 summary : <p>BaseUI will help you to manage your assets (a logo, footer, a menu, etc) in the browser, in a liquid layout or a fixed layout. </p>

<p>BaseUI handles a list of DisplayObject. You will be able to use properties like top, bottom, left, right, horizontalCenter, verticalCenter, width and height even with percentage, some ratio mode for backgrounds and other specific properties.</p>
 summary : <p>AS3BloggerLib is an Actionscript 3.0 library that allows installed (AIR) applications to access the Blogger Data API. This library also contains functionality to authenticate a Google account using Google&#39;s ClientLogin protocol.  </p>

<p>It should be noted that this library only works with AIR applications due to the fact that, at this time, Blogger does not implement a cross-domain file. </p>

<p>Dependencies: as3corelib, as3syndicationlib </p>

<p>This project is still in development.</p>

 title : The as3bots Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThis project aims to provide an API to create a virtual robot battle game. ActionScripters will be able to code their own bots to compete against everyone else&#39;s in a Flash environment. </p>

<p>The idea is to have the arena, rules and a base bot created to allow beginners or advanced coders to easily build AI-based robots. </p>

<p>Once it is up and running, the idea is to build a bot that manipulates the data that it can acquire from the Game in the most optimum and efficient way - a really good way of learning AS3 and/or best practices. The info that can be gained from the Game will be limited for each bot, so programmers will need to choose which areas to specialise in. As the bot progresses in the ranks it will be able to gain more information, so its abilities can be extended. </p>

<p>This is a shared project, where anyone can contribute ideas and/or code. </p>

<p>Phase 2 and 3 are complete, with the latter integrating the motor2 physics engine. </p>

<p>Future PhasesWe already have many ideas for future phases of this project. These are viewable on the wiki. </p>

 summary : <p>As3cAs3c is a bytecode compiler for the AVM2 written in C#. </p>

<p>FeaturesIt allows you to... </p>

<p>compile inline assemlber instructions written in in ActionScript 3 while maintining full debugging capabilities. compile pure bytecode into a precompiled output format. inject precompiled files into a SWF by replacing or creating methods. </p>

<p>As3c works great with Mono on Linux and OS X. You do not even have to recompile it. </p>

<p>Syntax exampleHello worldThis example is equivalent to a simple trace(&#39;Hello World!&#39;). </p>

<p>package  
<br/>{
<br/>	import flash.display.Sprite;
<br/>	
<br/>	import de.popforge.asm.Op;
<br/>	import de.popforge.asm.__asm;		</p>

<br/>				Op.callPropertyVoid(&#39;public::trace&#39;, 1)´
<br/>			);
<br/>		}
<br/>	}
<br/>}New possibilitiesWhen using asm you can define labels wherever you want. You can also jump to labels from any point in your code. This opens completly new possibilities as you can see. Although this one might be a little bit confusing ;) </p>

<br/>{
<br/>	import flash.display.Sprite;
<br/>	
<br/>	import de.popforge.asm.Op;

<p>Detailsas3Glue is an ActionScript 3 library that enables communication between Flash/Flex/AIR applications and Arduino boards. It can together with one or several Arduino boards be used to monitor sensors (such as rotary encoders and motion detectors), control actuators (such as LEDs and motors) and interface other electronics (such as RFID readers) from Flash, Flex and AIR applications.  </p>

<p>The library includes Arduino sketches and ActionScript 3 code examples as well as the Standard Firmata v2 Arduino firmware and a serial proxy. </p>

<p>Firmata 1.0 vs Firmata 2.0The latest version of this library was developed for Firmata 2.0.  Arduino 0012 and later are distributed with Firmata 2.0. Earlier versions shipped with Firmata 1.0, which is NOT compatible with 2.0. If your project requires Firmata 1.0, you can find an earlier version of as3Glue the downloads section, although we do not recommend it for new projects. </p>

<p>FAQIf anybody from Adobe is reading this: Please add outputProgress event to Socket. (This is the same behavior as outputProgress event in FileStream.)  Otherwise it is impossible to determine the ouput progress on socket writes.. see http://rel.me/2008/1/17/socket-output-progress-in-air for more info.   </p>

<p>Everyone else: Vote for the fix! </p>

<p>Common questions: </p>

<p>In order to use flash.net.Socket in a Flash sandbox environment, you need to have a flash socket policy server. (AIR does not have this restriction.) Look at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html. To debug in the environment, I would use a standalone flash debug player with logging configured and you will see it attempt to connect to flash socket policy server at port 843. Because of this restriction, this library might be more suited for AIR apps. HTTPS doesn&#39;t always work. There are some minor bugs with the as3crypto library, so for example https at yahoo and yahoo owned domains (like delicious) don&#39;t currently work. </p>

<p>The goals for this project are: </p>

<p>Learn the HTTP protocol by trying to implement a client. Use AS3Crypto TLSSocket support for implementing HTTPS. Use it as a replacement for Flash&#39;s URLRequest/URLStream API. Support the Flash and AIR runtimes. </p>

<p>WorkingGET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE multipart/form-data (PUT and POST) HTTPS support using AS3Crypto TLS Post with application/x-www-form-urlencoded Reading chunked (Transfer-Encoding) Next to implementThe other http verbs Connection keep-alive gzip compression ...</p>

 summary : <p>The goal of the ActionScript 3 mail library is to provide easy access to mail protocols such as SMTP and POP3. </p>

<p>ProgressTo keep you informed on the progress being made in the development of this library, I&#39;ll try to update this as frequently as possible. Please keep in mind I only have limited time to work on this project. </p>

<p>So far, the following has been done: </p>

<p>Stateful SMTP support (EHLO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA, RSET, QUIT) The Internet Message Format (RFC 2822) has been largely implemented Documentation generated for all public classes Initial import of both the source and documentation has been done, all progress so far is available under Source </p>

<p>Next up: </p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say you have a Matrix A, and you compute the determinant of A. The class will cache that value and whenever you recall determinant, this class will give you the cached value instead of recalculating the determinant. </p>

<p>The drawback to this is that, while it is fast, it takes up a bit more memory. </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionSome time ago I was working on a little project for which I wanted to read and write Excel files in Flex. I Googled hither and yon but sadly I could only find a sample someone tossed out there sans code. So, I put together a little package to read and write Excel files. So far it supports reading text, numbers, formulas, and dates from Excel version 2.x-2003 and writing text, numbers, and dates. Formulas also update to reflect changes in cells they reference. </p>

<p>The API is intended to be straightforward and easy to use. There are some samples to play with and the obligatory ASdocs.  </p>

<p>SamplesI put together a few quick samples to show how it all works. </p>

 title : The asteriskcallnotification Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AsteriskNotifcationClient is an OS X Application which displays a message when it is notified by a Asterisk PBX. </p>

<p>It searches the local address book and if no contact was found the database for swiss telephone numbers: tel.search.ch </p>

<p>To be able to display call notifications you must install growl: </p>

<p>http://growl.info/ </p>

<p>Your Asterisk PBX must be running «Notify application module for the Asterisk PBX» It is open source and can be downloaded here: </p>

<p>http://www.mezzo.net/asterisk/app_notify.html </p>

<p>To build this app you need Xcode version 3.1 or greater. </p>

<p>To run the app you need OS X 10.5 Leopard or greater. </p>

<p>To test the app without a Astersik PBX please use the ruby script called udpserver.rb </p>

<p>just type this in your command line: </p>

<p>ruby udpserver.rb 00070707 </p>

<p>00070707 is the calling number</p>

 title : The async-msgcomp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Asynchronous messaging allows components to communicate in a robust and reliable manner. In particular sending a message is a non-blocking operation. This means that a receiver of the message cannot directly effect the sender. Compare this to synchronous messaging where the sender is blocked until the receiver decides to return. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to implement a light weight, robust and reliable asynchronous messaging scheme that supports inter and intra process communication within the same &quot;computer&quot; as well as inter-device communication. In addition, it is to be OS and language agnostic. </p>

 title : The asynchronous Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AynchronousNow you can make any method in one of your models asynchronous.  For example,  </p>

<p>class TestRecord &lt; ActiveRecord::Base    </p>

<p>after_save :an_alert 
<br/>   def an_alert 
<br/>logger.info &#39;We could now asynchronously send an email to tons of people with this alert.&#39; 
<br/>end 
<br/>asynchronous :an_alert 
<br/>end </p>

<p>That&#39;s it, just install the plugin, add a &#39;QueuedMethods&#39; table (follow my migration script), and add the &#39;asynchronous :symbol&#39; part below where you declare the method you are making asynchronous.  I&#39;ve included a migration script in the db folder to use for the QueuedMethods table.  </p>

<p>To process your queue just set up a cron job using the script runner: </p>

<p>&#39;script/runner &#39;MethodQueue.process&#39; -e production&#39; </p>

<p>This is still in its first draft, but working under the conditions shown in the tests.  Please feel free though to hack at it an make it better.  I think it&#39;s a pretty useful tool.  But a couple things I don&#39;t like:  </p>

<p>1) What&#39;s the standard way these days to create a table a plugin depends on?  Probably not in the install.rb in case there is a name conflict?  </p>

<p>2) The &#39;asynchronous&#39; part has to be declared below the method declaration.  Is there anyway to make it agnostic of the method declaration location? </p>

<p>TestingIf you want to test, you need to have a test table for the test model setup in the database.  I included a mysql.sql file to create that table in the test/fixtures dir.  Then you can just run &#39;rake&#39;, in your RAILS_PROJ/vendor/plugins/asynchronous. </p>

<p>Major ThanksChris Eppstein provided a great patch that got rid of race condition the original plugin had.  This makes it truly useful for most jobs people need something like this for.  Thanks man! </p>

 title : The aszip Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ASZip lets you generate ZIP files from ActionScript 3. </p>

<p>Here comes ASZip to generate Zip files from scratch with some files and folders into it. </p>

<p>This first version is using the native gzip (Deflate) compression from the flash.utils.Bytearray.compress() method, more compression algorithms will be added later like PPMD or Bzip2 and more. </p>

<p>To generate a zip file, with a text file and a PNG file, you would do : </p>

<p>// create the Zip file, first param : compression method
<br/>var myZip:ASZip = new ASZip (CompressionMethod.GZIP);
<br/>// create a flash.display.BitmapData
<br/>var myStevie:Stevie = new Stevie (0, 0);
<br/>// encode it as a PNG
<br/>var bytes:ByteArray = PNGEnc.encode (myStevie);
<br/>// create a text stream
<br/>var txt:ByteArray = new ByteArray();
<br/>// write some text into it
<br/>txt.writeUTFBytes(&quot;Hello there !!&quot;);
<br/>// add a pics folder
<br/>myZip.addDirectory (&quot;pics/&quot;);
<br/>// then a text folder
<br/>myZip.addDirectory (&quot;text/&quot;);
<br/>// pass the PNG stream and specify a file name and location
<br/>myZip.addFile (bytes, &quot;pics/stevie.png&quot;);
<br/>// pass the text stream and specify a file name and location
<br/>myZip.addFile (txt, &quot;text/story.txt&quot;);
<br/>// add a comment
<br/>myZip.addComment (&quot;A comment !&quot;);
<br/>// generate final Zip file
<br/>var myZipFile:ByteArray = myZip.saveZIP ( Method.LOCAL );</p>

 title : The atlas-addon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Atlas, a World of Warcraft instance map browser Copyright 2005 - 2009 Dan Gilbert Email me at loglow@gmail.com About AtlasFor some reason, Blizzard decided to include beautiful maps for every area of Azeroth except instances. You can still see the area surrounding you in the minimap when you&#39;re in an instance, but never the overall layout of the entire dungeon. This is where Atlas comes in. The core of Atlas is basically an image viewer. However, it&#39;s the images that come with Atlas that make it worthwhile: a map for every instance in the game. Furthermore, the maps are marked with the locations of bosses and other points of interest. Atlas also includes maps of battlegrounds, dungeon locations, flight points, and outdoor raid bosses. </p>

<p>After installing Atlas, you&#39;ll notice a new icon on the minimap that looks like part of a little globe (you can right-click the icon to drag it around the minimap&#39;s frame). Click this icon to open up the main Atlas window, which displays the maps and legend. You can alternatively use the slash-command /atlas. The drop-downs at the top of the window enable you to navigate between the maps. You can also drag the Atlas window around the screen. Lock it in place with the little lock button in the upper-right corner. </p>

<p>At the bottom of the legend is a small text-entry field as well as Search and Reset buttons. Type part of a word or name in the box and click the Search button, and the legend&#39;s entries are reduced to only those that match your text. Note that the search is performed only on the entries for the current map, not all the entries in the database. While not so useful for instances with only a few entries like Ragefire Chasm, the search comes in handy when there are a ton of entries, like for Blackrock Depths or the AtlasMajorCities plug-in. If you want to get the whole list back, just click Reset. </p>

<p>ConfigurationAtlas has a few simple options, accessible from the Options button in the upper-right corner of the main window, or with the slash-command /atlas options. A few of the settings aren&#39;t very self-explanatory so here&#39;s some more information about them. &quot;Auto-Select Instance Map&quot; detects the instance that you&#39;re in when you open Atlas, and then automatically switches to the appropriate map. This feature doesn&#39;t work in instances that have more than one map, like Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul, or many of the Outland instances. In this case, Atlas remembers the last map you had open. &quot;Right-Click for World Map&quot; makes the World Map open when you right-click anywhere on the Atlas window. This is useful when you want to quickly switch from Atlas to the World Map. &quot;Clamp Window to Screen&quot; makes it so that you can&#39;t drag the Atlas window off the edge of the screen. The rest of the options are pretty straightforward. The Reset Position button is useful if the Atlas window ever gets dragged completely off-screen and you can&#39;t get it back. </p>

<p>Atlas PluginsAtlas has a built-in plugin system allowing for the easy addition of map packs. In fact, Atlas ships with four of these plugins (for battlegrounds, dungeon locations, flight points, and outdoor raid bosses). If you&#39;re interested in making your own Atlas map pack, I suggest you start with one of these four as a guide. You can contact me or post on the Atlas forums if you need help, however I suggest you do as much research as possible beforehand. Furthermore, there are several Atlas plugins that do more than simply provide additional maps. AtlasLoot provides a loot table for each boss, and AtlasQuest displays the quests associated with each instance. Note that I don&#39;t develop these plugins myself; they have their own project leads. </p>

<p>Before InstallingAny previous versions of Atlas must be deleted prior to installation. Atlas plugins (AtlasLoot, AtlasQuest, etc.) designed for any version of Atlas prior to this one must be deleted. Map packs supplied by Daviesh for Atlas 1.8.6 must be deleted prior to installation (they&#39;re unnecessary now anyway). How to InstallUnzip the package into your World of Warcraft folder. Your zip software must preserve directory structures.

 title : The atvusb-creator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The uber USB flash drive creator for the AppleTV. Creates USB flash drive based installers that include patchstick, factory restore and various LInux distributions. </p>

<p>Brought to you by the creators of atv-bootloader and many others. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Intel/PPC OSX version of  atvusb-creator.  </p>

<p>The Windows XP/Vista interim solution atv-win </p>

<p>Note that the current version is atvusb-creator-1.0.b13 and atv-win-3.0.zip </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This version is comes with ssh, bin tools, and two plugins (XBMC/Boxee Installer/Launcher and SoftwareMenu). That&#39;s right, two full blown OSX applications with their own AppleTV plugin to launch AND get updates. And not only that but previous problems with launching an application into the front under all display resolutions has been resolved. </p>

<p>Remember that some USB flash drives just will not format correctly and if you have problems try another brand. Minimum flash size is 512MB. Follow the GUI and select &quot;ATV Patchstick&quot;, make sure to select the correct disk and hit the circling arrows to the left of the drive menu if you insert the USB flash drive after launching atvusb-creator. </p>

<p>The contents of the patchstick will look like the following, if yours does not look similar or is empty, then the creation failed and you need to create again either by pre-formating two hfsplus partitions using disk utility or trying a different brand flash drive. All USB flash drive are different, some work, some do not work. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Standard patchstick rules: create the patchstick on your OSX box, power-down the AppleTV, insert the flash drive, power-up the AppleTV, wait for boot/patching, power-down again, remove flash drive and power up and enjoy XBMC for Mac (http://xbmc.org) or Boxee for Mac.(http://www.boxee.tv)  Remember that Boxee requires an account so if you don&#39;t have one, head on over to http://www.boxee.tv/atvusb and register for an account. </p>

<p>One final note (sure, sure), Both XBMC and Boxee are net installed from XBMC/Boxee launcher so remember to first select &quot;Update&quot; and install the individual applications. </p>

<p>Oh yes, atvusb-creator can be found in the downloads section so have at it and enjoy XBMC and Boxee native on the AppleTV OS. </p>

<p>The other two platform (Linux and Windows) will be released later.  </p>

<p>XBMC Launcher-0.8 has been released. Check the Update menu in either XBMC or Boxee Launchers. Not only can the Launcher update the Application but it can also update itself. Next for this version is the XBMC and Boxee Launchers have been combined into one. the launcher update will remove both of the older launchers and remove them with the new one. XBMC/Boxee Launcher issues should be goto http://code.google.com/p/atv-xbmc-launcher/issues/list  </p>

<p>Quick Help </p>

<p>1) if the sha1 checksum fails, then the download of the AppleTV update dmg failed and you need to delete it from the downloads folder. </p>

<p>2) WARNING DO NOT RUN atvusb-creator-1.0.0.b1 TWICE, there is an error that will require a AppleTV Factory Restore to fix if you run the PATCHSTICK twice. Much apologies if this has happened, do a factory restore and use b8. Once again, DO NOT RUN a patchstick made from atvusb-creator-1.0.0.b1.tar.gz TWICE.  UPDATE: This warning does not apply to versions greater than b1.  </p>

<p>3) And take the spaces out of the name of the folder name in atvusb-creator-1.0.b2.tar.gz </p>

<p>4) Users need to stop highjacking other issue threads. If you have a problem, please take the time to create an issue with a description of the problem. Otherwise I can&#39;t see that someone has added something different and respond and more important, others can find a previously solved issue with having to read every comment. </p>

<p>5) This uses the AppleTV update dmg and NOT the MacOSXUpdCombo10.4.9Intel.dmg or any other dmg. We are pulling out boot.efi from the AppleTV update dmg. Only this boot.efi will work for booting the AppleTV. The text above the &quot;Choose a DMG&quot; says &quot;Download AppleTV update DMG&quot; for a reason and no other DMG will work. </p>

<p>6) I&#39;m still seeing downloads of other version, the current version is atvusb-creator-1.0.b13 and this version does fix some issues that are present in the other versions. </p>

<p>7) WARNING Be very careful in selecting the correct USB device. Any USB mass storage devices are selectable and once you start the process, the contents are gone! A future version will have more info about the USB mass storage device selected and issue warning if the size is greater that 16GB. </p>

<p>8) If you are having problems under 10.5 getting the download to extract in Safari,  turn off auto expand in safari, then re-download and expand using the Finder. </p>

<p>Uninstall XBMC/BoxeeThis is done on the terminal after logging into the atv by ssh, but still pretty easy, as there are only a few folders to delete (password is frontrow): </p>

<p>login (if appletv.local does not work use the IP address of your AppleTV) </p>

<p>ssh frontrow@appletv.localdelete launcher and XBMC / Boxee </p>

<p>sudo rm -rf /Applications/{Boxee,XBMC}.app/ 
<br/>sudo rm -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/PlugIns/XBMCLauncher.frappliance/remove settings of Boxee and XBMC: </p>

<p>rm -rf /Users/frontrow/Library/Application\ Support/{BOXEE,XBMC}/reboot and that&#39;s it </p>

<p>sudo rebootmain</p>

 title : The autoconnect Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Auto Connect ProjectIntroductionThis module provides the handy ability to get a connection string from a client to server, without having to do specific configuration. The basic idea is the server broadcast on a small list of random ports. The client listens on one of these random ports. When it  receives the broadcast the data contains the connection string for the server.  </p>

<p>One example usage is in an internet cafe management system I developed. The client program was installed via a windows installer. Originally the user then had to edit the config for each machine in the shop. This was fine for one or two machines. However if you&#39;ve got 70+ machines this it took a long time to update the configuration. One solution is to have default set up locations. However if you have to move the server off the default or change it later, then you need to update all the clients again. </p>

<p>My solution to this was to use UDP broadcasts. The server ran a &#39;beacon&#39; when the clients &#39;watched&#39; for. When the client started it watched for the beacon. Upon &#39;seeing&#39; it, it was able to connect. The clients stopped watching for the server beacon until it lost its  connection or the server went down. This was very useful and was later expanded to tell  clients about other servers that were near by. </p>

<p>ExampleThe &quot;autoconnect.example&quot; contains an example client and server that models the basic idea. The &quot;test_server.py&quot; runs a simple XML-RPC server and the &quot;test_client.py&quot; discovers this and connects to call the greet() method. </p>

<p>The unit test case for this project also illustrate how the project is used. Look in the &quot;autoconnect.tests&quot; for further details.</p>

 summary : <p>AutoRest first public release 31/10/2007Simplify the development of rest based applications by using a generic controller implementation.  
<br/>Based on scaffold_resource of rails 1.2.3. 
<br/>   </p>

<p>With a single call of a class method, includes the default methods for a rest controller  
<br/>using user-supplied configuration. 
<br/>   Smart defaults are generated for all the missing configuration parameters. 
<br/>   </p>

<p>AuthorEmmanuel Oga. http://EmmanuelOga.WordPress.com 
<br/>UsageFor a complete sample app, check the sample app in the downloads. 
<br/>That app should be extracted to the root of the plugin. The sample app specs covers a great deal of the functionality that would be very difficult to spec without a complete rails app. 
<br/>By using the ar_spec_scaffold generator, a controller with all the options ready for customize is generated. 
<br/>   </p>

<p>The generator usage is the same as scaffold_resource: </p>

<p>ruby script/generate auto_rest ResourceName optional_field_1:type ... optional_field_n:type 
<br/>     </p>

<p>The optional fields are used only to include them on the migration. This generator produces also  
<br/>the proper specs on RAILS_ROOT/spec folder. You can use the --skip-rspecing to skip the generation 
<br/>of rspec-based specs. 
<br/>   Don&#39;t forget to: 
<br/>have rspec and rspec on rails plugins and have ran ruby script/generate rspec if you wish  to use rspec. 
<br/>      Set the routes. AutoRest is currently developed with a maximum 2-level  nesting of routes in mind. See http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources 
<br/>        So it uses routes like 
<br/>         ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| 
<br/>search_opt= { :search =&gt; :get } 
<br/>         map.resources :zones, :collection =&gt; search_opt do |zone| 
<br/>zone.resources :customers, :name_prefix =&gt; &quot;zone&quot;  
<br/>end 
<br/>         map.resources :customers, :collection =&gt; search_opt 
<br/>end 
<br/>       For the integrated ferret support, you should put a :search =&gt; :get route on the collection of resources, just like i did above. Also include acts_as_ferret 
<br/>plugin and acts_as_ferret on the model class of the resource. 
<br/>       Set the proper resource relationships on models (has_many / belongs_to)      Create an application layout. If you include a call to ar_breadcrumbs in your layout, breadcrumbs will be available (i would say this is only usefull when you are working with nested resources).   &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&gt; AutoRest Test App

 title : The avyenne Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Avyenneor living the &quot;not invented here&quot; syndrome </p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to learn to develop a text editor in Mono/.NET from scratch. </p>

<p>I really like the Emacs concept, but as you grow into elisp, you become too tied to it, at least in my opinion. Say &quot;reusability&quot;... I don&#39;t use elisp outside of Emacs and I&#39;ve heard some opinions on Emacs like &quot;lisp is not Haskell&quot; or similar. I&#39;ve been looking for an editor which supports just any extension/macro language I want to. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve always wanted my own text editor (shoot me). ;) </p>

<p>So, what I&#39;d like to borrow from the Emacs concept is: </p>

<p>modes - I really like the concept of modes. I see them as extensible packages which define what I can do with a file. I&#39;d like them to feel more &quot;packaged&quot; but still abstract in terms of using common operations (like saving a file or &quot;M-x compile&quot;). transparent extensibility - Look up a function&#39;s description (C-h f in Emacs), get to the source file, modify it and use your modification without hitches, like restarting the editor. Eclipse, for example, annoys me when everytime I install a plugin it wants to be restarted. extensive documentation - Okay, I certainly will be lacking here for some time. :) But it should be there. integration with other tools - Show me the lines of source-code my compiler complains about. Call a debugger when I run into errors. configuration in the editor itself - I&#39;m not sure about that one. I really like the idea, but I still want to have the option to use some fancy dialogs. </p>

<p>What I&#39;d like to add: </p>

<p>script engines - Choose whatever you want, as far as there&#39;s a .Net implementation which creates assemblies. There are many already. Some of them are: IronPython, IronRuby, Boo, IronScheme (!!! well, in the perfect utopia of my mind, using IronScheme as extension language will in fact be some kind of &quot;package-oriented&quot; emacs) plugin concept - Everything besides the core should be a plugin. The plugin engine should not be vloated, like in Eclipse. I&#39;d like a straightforward solution. I&#39;ve tried mono-addins, but it just doesn&#39;t fit. I need to load assemblies directly (f.i. from script engines) refactoring - That is, keeping an AST in memory and using it. user interfaces as plugins - I don&#39;t want a definitive look. I want options for using the console, living in a Gnome environment, using the KDE look or MS Windows. Whatever there is or will be, I want to be able to put up a UI plugin which can handle the look of the user&#39;s environment. multithreading where it&#39;s useful - There are things which don&#39;t need to be synchronized that much. Like downloads of plugins for example? I want them to happen while I continue with what I was doing. Don&#39;t be too excessive here. Threads are evil in general. ;) </p>

<p>Problems: </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any clue yet, how to embed a scripting language in .NET in an elegant way. I have a working boo scripting engine, but looking at the IronPython source, I&#39;m getting ashamed of myself. :) I don&#39;t know much about abstract syntax trees and how to use them. I know about ANTLR and how it builds parsers and lexers I could apparently use. I have some problems with the UI at the time. I began to create my own edit control but I noticed it took longer than I wished. So, I&#39;ll be switching to Scintilla or whatever and prepare an abstract layer. I know this will be as much work as an own editor. but I can implement the things as I need them and concentrate on the other features first. This project really needs a better name!</p>
 title : The awapi-local-db-sync Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The AdWords API Local Database Sync project is designed to simplify the process of maintaining a local store of AdWords account data. The scripts that make up the project can be used to schedule reports using the AdWords API, store the results in a local database (using SQLite), and then run queries against the database to determine, for instance, what AdWords account data has recently been added or updated. </p>

<p>The scripts are written in Python, and make use of the SOAPpy libraries for accessing the AdWords API SOAP service. The Python code is written against the dbapi2 database API, and by default it will use the SQLite implementation and store the report data in a SQLite database file on the local file system. It is possible to swap out the SQLite libraries for another database library that supports the dbapi2 interface.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails 2.02 Amazon SimpleDB Deployed on Amazon EC2 No local database is used. No MySQL or sqlite. </p>

<p>See the Setup for installation instructions. You will need an Amazon Web Services account. </p>

<p>This is a rather simple project, but I think it does a decent job in demonstrating the power of handing off infrastructure to third-party utility computing services (clouds) like EC2, S3, SQS, and SimpleDB. </p>

<p>It would be trivial to scale this application with a little bit of resource caching (calls to  Amazon) and an observer. You could deploy it on n servers (in fact there are scripts that will automatically drop in new EC2 instances based on CPU load) without any concerns over database clustering. Naturally you still need to develop with data integrity in mind, and ActiveResource has no where near the attention of ActiveRecord to date, so it&#39;s not a replacement for your typical relational DB setup in most instances. </p>

<p>Next Steps:Implement a proper caching layer at the controllers. Put a decent UI on it. Replace the proxy with direct calls to SimpleDB (we&#39;re marshalling objects twice right now). Put together the cap recipes for EC2 deployment. - Dave Rapin</p>

 summary : <p>The B method is a rigorous software engineering process that is supported by a notation. The process starts with the creation of an initial model, composed essentially of state and operations. The state is a set of variables and an invariant condition that identifies the safe states. The operations may change the state of the model but shall be such that the invariant is preserved. Proof obligations that guarantee the overall consistency of the model are generated and must be discharged. The initial model is then the subject of successive refinements. Each refinement must also be checked rigorously. The result of the refinement process in the classic B method is an algorithmic level description of the operations that may then be synthesized to source code in a programming language. </p>

<p>The B method is supported by different industrial and academic tools. The purpose of this project is to provide techniques and tool support to extend the refinement process to generate assembly level description of the operations.</p>

<p>Parsing natural language is a hard problem, but it can be avoided by writing Babel.  By using this format natural language processing (NLP) can be separated from the real artificial intelligence work.  Babel provides a way to divide the two challenges. </p>

<p>Babel is not a representation of parsed natural language.  It is designed to represent specific meaning and does not include many of the subtleties of natural language.  Babel does not try to model natural language completely.  The aim is simply to be able to represent the meaning of most natural language.</p>

 summary : <p>Assignment 2: Game Playing
<br/>Due Oct. 15 at 11:59pm
<br/>This assignment can be done in teams of two.
<br/>Important Note: The university policy on academic dishonesty (cheating) will be taken
<br/>very seriously in this course. Students will work in pairs on this assignment. You may not
<br/>discuss the specific questions in this assignment, nor their solutions with any other group.
<br/>You may not provide or use any solution, in whole or in part, to or by another group.
<br/>You are encouraged to discuss the general concepts involved in the questions in the context
<br/>of completely different problems. If you are in doubt as to what constitutes acceptable
<br/>discussion, please ask! Further, please take advantage of office hours offered by the instructor
<br/>and the TA if you are having difficulties with this assignment.
<br/>Part 0: Starting Out
<br/>Download the Java backgammon code from the course website. Compile the code, and try
<br/>running the driver program Bg.class to play a game by yourself.
<br/>If you find bugs in the code, please report them via the class mailing list and I will distribute
<br/>an updated version of the code.
<br/>Part 1: Implement Expectiminimax Search
<br/>Create a new class ExpectiminimaxBackgammonAgent.java, a subclass of BackgammonAgent.
<br/>java, which performs minimax search. You will need to create a game tree con-
<br/>taining nodes corresponding to game states with branches corresponding to possible moves
<br/>and possible rolls of the dice. Use the evaluation function NaiveEvaluation.java to eval-
<br/>uate board configurations in the game tree that are at the cutoff depth.
<br/>Feel free to subclass NaiveEvaluation.java if it makes your testing easier.
<br/>Part 2: Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning
<br/>Create a new class, AlphaBetaBackgammonAgent.java which prunes search in the game
<br/>tree using the alpha-beta algorithm. It will be helpful to first write pseudocode for this
<br/>algorithm on paper before attempting to implement it. Submit this pseudocode along with
<br/>your source code (see Submitting Your Assignment below).
<br/>Again, feel free to subclass NaiveEvaluation.java if it makes your testing easier.
<br/>Part 3: Develop a Better Evaluation Function
<br/>Create a new class, BackgammonEvaluationXX YY.java, an extension of Evaluation.
<br/>java, where XX and YY are your group members’ student numbers. Improve upon
<br/>the naive evaluation function distributed with the code. The following website contains

<br/>For example, a simple evaluation function could count the total number of spaces that a

<br/>function could count the number of “blots” (isolated checkers) left by a player, and give a
<br/>negative score to them.
<br/>The XX YY will be used to identify your backgammon playing agent in a tournament in-
<br/>volving the agents developed by the class. The best backgammon agent will earn a prize for
<br/>its creators. The tournament will be run using our own AlphaBetaBackgammonAgent.java,
<br/>so even if there is a problem with your implementations in Parts 1 and 2 you will be able to
<br/>participate in the tournament. The tournament will be run using 2-ply look-ahead. Agents
<br/>using evaluation functions that do not return values within reasonable amounts of time,
<br/>crash, or try anything shady will be disqualified,
<br/>Testing Notes
<br/>Testing these search algorithms can be time consuming. Please use these hints to make
<br/>testing simpler:
<br/>• Modify DIE MAX in Dice.java to be a small number.
<br/>• Turn off doubles by setting use doubles to false in BackgammonBoard.java.
<br/>• Set up the board with only a few pieces in a particular configuration.
<br/>For testing Expectiminimax and Alpha-beta, it is sufficient to show two small example cases
<br/>for each. Print out a visualization of your search tree, showing your algorithm choosing the
<br/>correct move. For the Alpha-beta search, you should also print out the alpha and beta values
<br/>when printing the search tree.

 title : The badges Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Badges is an authorization plugin (as in &quot;we don&#39;t need no stinking badges&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinking_badges). </p>

<p>It does not provide authentication capability, nor it&#39;s own User model, but instead is meant to work with other authentication plugins such as acts_as_authenticated or restful_authentication.  You will need a User model, and the &#39;current_user&#39; method to be implemented at the controller level using an include. </p>

<p>Badges relies on the following domain model: A Privilege represents a particular named capability that is checked for authorization. Roles have a set of Privileges. Privileges can belong to more than one Role. Users can have one or more Roles. Users can have a role in general, or a role on an authorizable object, or on a Class of authorizable objects. </p>

<p>Badges enforces authorization by checking if a user has a particular privilege.  Users get privileges by having roles, as each role comes with a certain set of privileges.  Since what privileges a role has is stored in the database, it is easy to create new roles with different levels of privilege without needing to change any code, or to change existing roles while the application is running.  There is an included UI for updating roles and privileges. </p>

<p>Authorization can be checked at all layers of the application: view, controller, and model. </p>

<p>View: </p>

<p>  You have the privilege to  &#39;Are you sure?&#39;, :method =&gt; :delete %&gt; the project!</p>

<p>Controller: </p>

<p>  class FooController &lt; ApplicationController

<br/>    privilege_required &#39;manage foos&#39;, :on=&gt;Some::Foo :only =&gt; [:create, :update, :destroy]

<p> </p>

<p>Barcode Generator for Rails - ReDuxBarcode generator makes generating/displaying barcodes in any format like, PNG,JPEG,JPG etc.. for any alphanumeric id, a piece of cake. </p>

<p>It uses Gbarcode for encoding barcode data and ImageMagick to generate  images out of it for displaying in views.(yes yes.. you read it correct, its NOT using RMagick anymore) </p>

<p>This way we can generate any barcode type which Gbarcode -&gt; Gnome Barcode project supports. </p>

<p>USAGEits as simple as saying  </p>

<p> This will generate a barcode for FJJ4JD in BARCODE_39 format with default width and height and include it in the view. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>the images are stored in /public/images/barcodes subdir. </p>

<p>Options Options Options ..to customize your barcodes, you can optionally pass following information in your views  </p>

<p>encoding_format (Gbarcode constants for eg. Gbarcode::BARCODE_128 etc..) width height scaling_factor xoff yoff margin   in this case your view will look like : </p>

<p> 100, 
<br/>                    :width  =&gt; 400,
<br/>		    :margin =&gt; 100,
<br/>		    :xoff   =&gt; 20,
<br/>		    :yoff   =&gt; 40
<br/>%&gt; this will produce something beautiful like this .... </p>

<p> </p>

<p>InstallationRequirementsImageMagick (c image manipulation library more info ) gbarcode (ruby gem:: gem install gbarcode more info ) install plugin via svnscript/plugin install http://barcode-generator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/barcode_generator </p>

<p>PROJECT MOVED TO GITHUB </p>

<p>http://github.com/aenima/base-auth/tree/master</p>
 summary : <p>Client for the Google Base API implemented in RubyBase4R is currently able to create and update Google Base items. Support for querying the Base API could be added in the future, contributions are welcome. </p>

<p>2009-05-28I have exported the code to github for anyone that prefers to use git http://github.com/doooks/base4r/tree/master == </p>

<p>2008-08-18 API docs updated.2008-08-17 Updated to v0.2Add a required &quot;unique_id&quot; attribute to Item, as this is now required for all Base items see http://base.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78170#id. Workaround xml formatting weirdness that has appeared since I last ran the unit tests by removing inter-tag whitespace in unit tests. Remove the default values for &quot;target_country&quot; and &quot;item_lang&quot; in the constructor for UniversalItem and ProductItem to make the code a little less Brit-centric.</p>
 title : The base4r Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The basecampjs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a JavaScript wrapper for the Basecamp API. It covers everything in the API except file attachments for comments and messages. For the API to work it has to be used in an environment like AIR where cross-domain XMLHttpRequest calls are allowed. </p>

<p>Here is an example of getting back an Array of projects from Basecamp. </p>

<p>var basecamp = new Basecamp(&quot;your.basecamp.url&quot;, &quot;user_name&quot;, &quot;password&quot;);
<br/>basecamp.projects({
<br/>	success: function( projects_xml ) {
<br/>		var projects = Basecamp.Project.from_xml( projects_xml );
<br/>		alert( projects.length );
<br/>	}
<br/>};Here is an example of how to create a new message assuming you&#39;ve already used the API to retrieve the desired project_id, message_category_id and person_id. </p>

<p>var message = new Basecamp.Message({
<br/>	title: &quot;Testing from API&quot;,
<br/>	body: &quot;This is a test from the JavaScript API wrapper.&quot;,
<br/>	category_id: message_category_id
<br/>});
<br/>basecamp.post_message( project_id, message, [person_id], {
<br/>	success: function( message_xml ) {
<br/>		var message = Basecamp.Message.from_xml( message_xml )[0];
<br/>		alert( message.id );
<br/>	}
<br/>});Why?I finally found some time to explore Adobe AIR and thought ... &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t I write an AIR app for Basecamp.&quot; The first step was to write this API wrapper/adapter so that I could easily communicate with Basecamp. </p>

<p>RoadmapIf I continue to find time (and have a Basecamp account to play with) this API will surely evolve as I begin to use the different parts while building the AIR app. Beware that as it stands right now this API wrapper is mostly untested. </p>

<p>I&#39;m particularly anxious to add the file uploading for messages and comments. </p>

<p>DocumentationFirst place to look is the actual Basecamp API documentation (http://developer.37signals.com/basecamp/index.shtml). Currently this API follows their Ruby wrapper (http://developer.37signals.com/basecamp/basecamp.rb) very closely. Other than that ... its all code for now. :)</p>
 summary : <p>Ideally this will work somewhat like an engine, providing cart, user registration, shipping, pricing and categories.  </p>

<p>However it will leave the products objects/format up to the store creator as each type of product has specific requirements. Just add &#39;acts_as_product&#39; to your Car, Bike, Painting etc object.</p>

<p>This project splits the bash completion package of Ian Macdonald (see: http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion) into multiple files. </p>

<p>The objectives of this project are that bash completion: </p>

<p>should load faster should consume less memory should have an open development environment should have automated tests </p>

<p>Should load fasterBash-completion-lib loads 10 times faster as does the single file bash completion package. </p>

<p>Should consume less memoryCompletion functions are loaded run-time for only those commands you actually complete - the moment you press TAB.  After the first completion, the completion function is installed and stays in memory for fast subsequent completions. </p>

<p>Should have an open development environmenthttp://code.google.com/p/bash-completion-lib/ </p>

<p>Should have automated testsDejaGnu is used to run automated tests. </p>

<p>It shipps a huge scriptchain, that is used by the styles shipped with BS-NG, but can also be used separately. Since v6.3 you have the opportunity to create your own prompts. For important notes on how to do so, refer back to the documentation. </p>

<p>If you don’t understand an option or something does not work as expected read the documentation. It’s installed in /usr/share/doc/bashstyle-ng/index.html ( /usr is default but may vary if you passed an other prefix to configure). </p>

<p>Currently BS-NG shipps 15 pre-defined Styles for your prompt. Most of them can be modified via the Custom Prompt Builder. If you want to save your current configuration and want to re-import it later (or for using it on a different user/machine) you can do so via the Profiler (bs-ng-profiler --help). </p>

<p>Standalone (GConf-Free) Configuration (for faster Bash-Startup) can be created via the RCGenerator (rcgenerator --help). </p>

<p>SVN AccessYou can get the latest in-development version by running: </p>

<p>svn co http://bashstyle-ng.googlecode.com/svn/trunk bashstyle-ng </p>

<p>Once you’ve done the initial checkout you can use svn up to update the svn. </p>

 title : The bayesian-inference Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This package is a collection of useful classes for basic Bayesian inference. Currently, its main goal is to be a tool for learning and exploration of Bayesian probabilistic calculations.  </p>

<p>Currently it also includes subpackages for stochastic simulation tools which are not strictly related to Bayesian inference, but are currently being developed within BIP. One such package is the BIP.SDE which contains a parallelized solver for stochastic differential equations, an implementation of the Gillespie direct algorithm. </p>

<p>The Subpackage Bayes also offers a tool for parameter estimation of Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamical Models. This tool will be fully described briefly in a scientific paper currently submitted for publication.  </p>

<p>I hope that in time it will mature into an useful tool for general use.</p>

<br/>backup directory. 
<br/>Add script to automate the whole process (including burning the CD/DVD) using anacron/cron functionality. 
<br/>Add notification capability which informs the user of scanning performed and alerts when the backup exceeds preferred value in MB. 
<br/>Possibly more to come... </p>

<p>Simple backup utility written in Ruby programming language! This project consists of just a small bunch of scripts, mainly to deal with XML configuration files. </p>

<p>Features: 
<br/>As you are probably aware at this point, this is a console based application Gathers files from many locations Keeps track of the data and copy only new files or the ones with different timestamps Keeps track of the previous backups to prevent storing the same files on different CD&#39;s Is configurable with simple wizard Has logging facility Checks the size of the backup folder and notify the user when it exceeds preferred size Checks the size of the file before adding it to the backup folder to see if it fits More or less that&#39;s all. Well, there are a few things someone who wants to try it should know. First, there is not much validation in place so please enter the data as specified in the examples when running the configuration utility. Second, the source is not commented in a very sophisticated way, but I think everyone who wants to tweak it a bit will find out what is where. The utility has no name yet, so feel free to send me some if you find this tool useful at all. The whole application consists of two main scripts, one for running configuration program and the other for running actual backup. </p>

<p>Installation: </p>

<p>This utility was written for Linux and for Linux only! Tested on Ubuntu 7.04. You would have to have ruby installed, check www.ruby-lang.org for download and installation instructions. For the application itself just download the tar.gz folder from the link below, unpack it, and you&#39;re ready to go! </p>

<p>Setup: </p>

<p>Simply run backupConfig.rb file (you can make it executable with chmod or run ruby filename.rb) and follow the rabbit. </p>

<p>Run: </p>

<p>Run bckp.rb similarly to backupConfig.rb, if you have ruby in place just make sure you have an -x flag set on this file or run ruby bckp.rb and you are ready to go. Before running bckp you have to run config utility to have all the settings in place. </p>

<p>If anyone will find it interesting, wants to learn some Ruby and would like to extend its functionality let me know and I put the files somewhere in cvs or subversion server. Possible enhancements include: </p>

<p>GUI with GTK2 or some other Linux aware toolkit some kind of notification facilities launching external CD/DVD burner or similar functionality If someone has some more ideas please feel free and let me know. </p>

<p>This script was written on Netbeans 6.0 M9 development version with Ruby support. </p>

 summary : <p>BComposer - Bulletin composition made easierIntroductionCreated to handle a complete mailout bulletin system, providing powerful features for administrators including user access and project based restrictions, and a simple live-editing interface for non-technical users. </p>

<p>A template system is provided using Liquid templates so that designers and programmers can create complex bulletins. which can be later &quot;filled-in&quot; my non-technical people, and not have to worry about a WYSIWYG editor causing havoc to the designs. </p>

<p>Recipients are managed on a per project-group basis, which means they can be shared between projects in the same group. This is a powerful feature that allows projects to share the same code base. </p>

<p>The project is currently of alpha quality. Although it will work perfectly well in most situations, there are still a few important features missing which may limit its implementation value. </p>

<p>Project DocumentationThis is still a big work in progress, so please expect more details soon. </p>

<p>Currently, BComposer is only recommend for experienced users as much of its functionality is not yet documented.  </p>

<p>InstalationInstructions - Basic instructions on how to get started and some requirements. FeatureRequests - some of the features that aren&#39;t quite there yet or are planned. CreatingTemplates - methods available for use in your Liquid base templates. ScreenShots - coming soon ... ProjectsUsingBcomposer - some (public) mailing lists which are using the application. InternationalisationGettext is supported although not fully implemented throughout the project. Currently Spanish and English are supported, but more can be added easily. If you would like to see BComposer in another language, please download the gettext source pot file, and create a new translation using a program like poEdit. </p>

<p>Who made this?This project was created by Sam Lown to initially provide a simple bulletin list program for the company Internet21 in Madrid. More interest came about for the project from other contacts and the project was subsequently released as Open Source. </p>

<p>If you find this program useful, I&#39;d love to hear from you, especially if you have made any modifications that could be back-ported to the main trunk. </p>

<p>Currently, I&#39;m quite busy on other projects, but should you wish for any further functionality and don&#39;t have the programming support in house, please get in contact with me. </p>

<p>After some thought, the Affero GPL license has not been used, subsequently you are free to modify the code for private use and provide a public service based on your code. Of course, any resale or distribution must include the source, and no fees can be made for the code itself. I would of course very much like to hear from anyone interested in creating a public service based on the project for support or features, and accept donations. </p>

<p>A dual-license may also be considered as currently I am the only author of the project, although I may take some convincing. Of course, any publicly contributed code could not be included without the explicit permission of the contributor.

Now I know that usually you are not too interested in how often your users try to violate the limits you impose on them but in my environment, a machine &quot;split&quot; into several instances using OpenVZ, it&#39;s pretty critical to know when the assigned resources aren&#39;t enough anymore. </p>

<p>On that note, I&#39;m planning on adding a way of seeing which limits are about to be breached by a vps so you can decide whether to raise the barrier or to wait for it to fail. </p>

 title : The beast-mcmc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BEAST, Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees, is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular sequences. It is orientated towards (strict and relaxed) molecular clock analyses. It can be used as a method of constructing phylogenies, but it is also intended for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. It uses an XML input format that allows the user to design and run a large range of models. We also include a program that can convert NEXUS files into this format. </p>

<p>By overlaying an unencrypted base install with an encrypted filesystem via UnionFS, all changes made to a system are unreadable to an unauthorized user. This would include not only valuable personal or proprietary information, but any other data which may seem harmless, but as an aggregate provide more information about the users than they would like available to a thief or anybody else who might acquire physical access. </p>

Apple gave us that spiffy new HUD window but no controls to put on it.  So I started my own.  Yes I know there are a few good AppKits out there already to achive the desired look, but they use images to create the components.  I have hand drawn every one of these controls using ONLY native Cocoa drawing functions (NSBezierPath, NSGradient, etc...)  This makes them resolution independant and makes your app less heavy come distribution time</p>

<p>IntroductionBicycle LED POV is an electronic LED bar to attach on bicycle wheels. When riding the bicycle, the LED bar will draw with light, text messages and image animations. </p>

<p>Custom text messages and animations will be drawn on a PC software and downloaded using an USB cable. </p>

<p>Goals of the projectcreate a Free/Open hardware, firmware and software LED POV for bicycle wheels; easy to use for non electronics technician people; find some company that wants to sell PCBs, kits or final assembled product;   use only Free Software tools as possible, like CAD software for PCB design, C compiler for MCU firmware, etc; open to improvements and new ideas from community. Your participationBecause hacking is fun and projects are like life, always evolving, If you have any ideas, If you think you can improve the project, If you want to say something, please leave a message on the discussion group. This project is a work in progress, It&#39;s an effort to improve actual bicycle LED POVs as the SpokePOV from Ladyada. There is room for a lot of improvements as the project involves different areas as: </p>

<p>mechanics; electronics; software; LED art; animations; demos. </p>

<p>DescriptionBicycle LED POV is an electronic LED bar to attach on bicycle wheels. A magnet is also attached on a fixed part of the bicycle (as example, the fork), so the hall effect sensor mounted on the Bicycle LED POV can detect each full rotation of the wheel. </p>

<p>Bicycle LED POV consist of mainly three different parts: Hardware; Software and Firmware. </p>

<p>Hardware </p>

<p>HaRdware consist of an electronics printed circuit board with LEDs and a few components as a microcontroller unit, a memory to hold the text messages and image animations, an USB connector and 2 NiMh cells. </p>

 title : The bio-vet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a somewhat random collection of bioinformatics programs and libraries written in Java/Groovy.   Or it will be, once I get a chance to prepare and upload some of the things I&#39;ve written.   </p>

<p>Note: This project is distinct and separate from the BioGroovy project which is built on top of BioJava.   I support the  BioGroovy/BioJava projects and don&#39;t want to cause any confusion, so when I get a chance to figure out how, I will change the name of my Google code project.  </p>

<p>AboutRecently I have found Groovy and Java together to be a very productive agile tool set.  For me, almost all development starts with a simple script that generates some smallish analysis that I have to do before the end of the day.  Over time, I end up reusing this code and improving it and often I end up having to build large-scale pipelines to do these same analysis in bulk.    Goovy+Java gives me a very smooth path to do this </p>

<p> Write quick and dirty single file scripts in Groovy to get today&#39;s results out.   If those prove useful, abstract the core bits out into reusable Groovy classes.   If those prove useful repeatedly invest the minimal effort to translate into Java.   Since Groovy can mix in Java classes with zero impedance, I am able to tap into the entire rich world of Java libraries in my quick-and-dirty one off scripts.   Moreover, since these libraries are distributed as JAR files compiled for the JVM, I can be almost certain that if I see a library somewhere on the web I want to use that I can download it, drop it in my groovy lib directory,  and it will just work.   This contrasts with languages where there is frequently some native component to compile, introducing a huge uncertainty as to whether or not I will be able to get a particular library to even install for me today, much less get the analysis results I need out and to my many customers.   In my field, it&#39;s all about getting results today, while somehow building an infrastructure for the long term in the background virtually for free.   Groovy/Java lets me do this.    </p>

<p>Without Groovy, Java is a poor choice for an agile bioinformatics language.  The syntax is noisy and employs maximal bondage (must tediously throw or catch all exceptions, etc.).  Those are good features for large projects, but when your project is in the early &quot;results today!!&quot; mode, it&#39;s not acceptable.   Moreover, java itself has clunky invocation syntax that usually forces you to wrap it in a shell script just to hide the ugliness from the user.    Groovy solves almost all of the issues that Java has an agile language.    Groovy can be run as a script or compiled, has lazy typing with dynamic type resolution, lots of syntatic sugar, Perl/Ruby-like regular expression syntax, list and hash syntax, easy deployment, etc.    </p>

 title : The biohacker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mistakes are the portals of discovery. James Joyce (1882-1941) </p>

<p>A metabolic network is defined as the set of biochemical reactions that the enzymes coded for in an organism&#39;s genome are capable of catalyzing. When the network of an organism is derived from pathway databases, it needs to be debugged for </p>

<p>incoherences e.g., the metabolic model must obey mass balance laws. 
<br/>incompleteness e.g., the metabolic model is missing known reactions, genes, or compounds 
<br/>inconsistencies e.g., the metabolic model is inconsistent with experimental results 
<br/>Because of these issues, reconstructing metabolic networks from annotated genomes is currently a time-consuming, error-prone process. </p>

<p>We develop BioHacker, a debugger for metabolic networks. BioHacker not only detects these issues, but also generates explanations as to where the problems lie and generates hypotheses for how to fix them. </p>

<p>thank you for your interest in our work.   if it is only for personal research / educational purpose, it is not necessary to do anything. please feel free to implement it and use it.   if you plan to use it for commercial purpose, you need to talk to the university&#39;s tech transfer office to get a lisence.   i personally pretty much interested in seeing silverlight version of 2.0 and apprecite your interest.   thanks takeo</p>
 summary : <p>The aim of this project is to provide an alternate method of providing traditional CAPTCHAs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha). CAPTCHA are devices that provide web forums and other web based resources with protection from computer generated spam.  Current techniques for the creation of CAPTCHAs are not compatible with the tools,  necessary for users with visual impairments to effectively use resources protected by CAPTCHAs.  Traditional CAPTCHAs are designed to prevent optical character recognition tools(OCR) thus tools for the visually impaired are not able to interpret the contents of the CAPTCHA.  Current methods of providing CAPTCHAs for the visually impaired use audio versions of the CAPTCHA, this version is susceptible to speach recognition software and as such distorted sounds are added to defeat this type of attack.  However this method is not ideal in noisy environments such as Coffee shops and offices where it can be challenging to distinguish between the environments background nose, distortions which are used to defeat speech recognition software and the contents of the CAPTCHA.  This results in numerous erroneous inputs and a frustrated user. </p>

<p>The method we propose requires the user to classify images correctly, in-order to verify that they are not an automated spamming program.   An example of this process would be for the user to be displayed five images: the sun, a person jumping, Batman, a flower and a pizza.  The user will be asked to select the images which describe action, as jumping is an action and Batman is an action film, then these two images would be the correct answer. This method can not be replicated by a computer program, making the complex associations between images and words which is currently not within the capabilities of computers and will remain so for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>Project Objectives: </p>

<p>  The creation of technology for the collection of large numbers of images to be used with the CAPTCHA system. </p>

<p>  To develop the machinery for the categorising of large numbers of images, through the use of human volunteers. </p>

<p>  To create a prototype using the categorised images. </p>

<p>  Conduct usability testing with the aide of target users. </p>

<p>  To report the findings in a written report, appropriate for publication or dissemination.</p>

 summary : <p>Chaque machine supervisée du parc a un « agent » déployé dessus, qui tourne en arrière-plan. Il s&#39;agit d&#39;un script Ruby que je vous fournis, capable d&#39;examiner les taux d&#39;occupation de la RAM et de différents points de montage disque (attention, il ne fonctionnera pas sous Windows). </p>

<p>Un serveur central (que vous allez réaliser en Rails) permet à l&#39;administrateur de définir facilement et rapidement son parc (salles, machines dans ces salles avec leurs IP…), et va interroger à intervalles réguliers ces machines pour vérifier qu&#39;elles sont actives, et leur agent opérationnel. Les agents examinent à intervalle régulier leur machine, et font spontanément remonter au serveur tout incident (taux d&#39;utilisation trop élevé). Le serveur fournit, dans son interface web, une page de supervision en temps réel, qui représente « graphiquement » le parc, et utilise AJAX pour ajuster fréquemment l&#39;aspect des machines représentées, afin de traduire les éventuels incidents (ou terminaisons d&#39;incident). </p>

<p>Définition simple de parc </p>

<p>L&#39;administrateur doit pouvoir injecter son parc dans le système : salles et machines dans ces salles. Une machine, pour les besoins de notre outil, peut se limiter à son nom et son IP, mais si vous voulez vous lâcher, libre à vous. </p>

<p>La définition du parc doit pouvoir se faire sans JavaScript, évidemment. Tout le système doit d&#39;ailleurs être accessible, et JavaScript/AJAX ne sont là que pour rendre le tout bien plus confortable. On doit donc avoir des liens et des formulaires classiques pour ajouter une salle, ajouter des machines dans une salle, et maintenir tout ça par la suite (retrait ou déplacement de machine, retrait de salle, etc.). </p>

<p>Une salle a simplement un nom : pour notre outil, on se fout un peu de sa capacité, son emplacement, etc. </p>

<p>À intervalle régulier (par exemple toutes les minutes), le serveur va vérifier que les machines inscrites dans le système sont joignables, et que l&#39;agent y est opérationnel. Pour cela, il se connecte sur l&#39;agent et envoie le message idoine. </p>

<p>Affichage de supervision </p>

<p>Il s&#39;agit d&#39;un écran affichant graphiquement le parc, qui se met à jour régulièrement pour refléter les incidents éventuels en cours. </p>

<p>Les salles sont représentées sous forme de boîtes rectangulaires. Dans ces boîtes, les machines concernées sont affichées (boîte obtenue par CSS, grand icône d&#39;ordinateur, comme vous voulez…) Tout incident en cours pour une machine est affiché en association avec celle-ci (icône plus petit superposé à, ou au-dessous de, la représentation de la machine) L&#39;écran doit pouvoir se mettre à jour régulièrement, de façon accessible. Si JavaScript n&#39;est pas actif, on aura donc recours à une équivalent HTTP de l&#39;en-tête Refresh, grâce à l&#39;élément </p>

<p>. Dans le cas contraire, on utilisera AJAX pour éviter de rafraîchir toute la page : la réponse nous indiquera alors uniquement les incidents terminés ou apparus depuis la dernière consultation, et on ajustera dynamiquement le contenu de la page. </p>

<p>Toujours dans un souci d&#39;accessibilité, toute image doit bien sûr avoir une contrepartie textuelle (qui n&#39;est pas forcément visible avec les images activées, mais doit l&#39;être en images désactivées ou dans une consultation textuelle de la page). </p>

<p>Il est inutile de rafraîchir trop souvent, sauf peut-être pendant les tests : un intervalle d&#39;une minute est a priori amplement suffisant (en revanche, au-delà de 5 minutes on n&#39;est vraiment plus « temps réel »). </p>

<p>Remontée d&#39;incidents et historisation </p>

<p>Les incidents parviennent au serveur de deux façons : </p>

<p>Il les détecte lui-même lors de vérifications périodiques de connectivité des agents, comme vu en section II.2. Les agents font spontanément remonter des incidents au travers d&#39;une requête HTTP de création REST appropriée, comme indiqué dans leur documentation. Le serveur doit historiser les incidents, ce qui suppose qu&#39;un incident a au moins les propriétés suivantes : </p>

<p>Machine concernée Type d&#39;incident (ex. RAM trop basse, espace libre trop bas sur un point de montage, connectivité défaillante) Propriétés complémentaires (ex. RAM restante, espace disque restant, etc.) Moment de détection (date/heure) Moment de résolution (constatation d&#39;incident terminé) Pour la connectivité, c&#39;est le serveur lui-même qui crée l&#39;incident et, lorsqu&#39;il constate qu&#39;elle fonctionne alors qu&#39;un incident est actif (détection sans résolution), le marque comme résolu. Pour les autres types d&#39;incidents, qui sont remontés spontanément par les agents, ces derniers gardent trace des incidents qu&#39;ils ont signalés et notifient automatiquement leur résolution lorsqu&#39;ils la constatent. </p>

<p>Cette historisation ouvre la voie au calcul de durées de résolution, de durées totales d&#39;incident, etc. On peut imaginer pas mal de statistiques. </p>

<p>Partie authentifiée </p>

<p>L&#39;application dispose d&#39;un ou plusieurs comptes utilisateur, tous administrateurs, et il est nécessaire de s&#39;authentifier pour pouvoir accéder à toute opération modificatrice, donc principalement la définition du parc. En revanche, la supervision, l&#39;interrogation manuelle, les éventuelles statistiques, etc. sont accessibles en anonyme. </p>

<p>Interrogation manuelle d&#39;une machine </p>

<p>Depuis l&#39;écran de supervision, il doit être possible d&#39;interroger manuellement l&#39;état d&#39;une machine en s&#39;adressant à son agent. On peut simplement vérifier sa connectivité, ou demander l&#39;état de la RAM ou d&#39;un point de montage. Cela peut avoir lieu dans un écran à part ou en AJAX (ceci dit, ça doit pouvoir être utilisable sans AJAX, comme d&#39;habitude). </p>

<p>Le contrôleur sollicité va se connecter à l&#39;agent comme il le ferait pour vérifier la connectivité, mais invoquer d&#39;autres commandes (voir la documentation), créer ou résoudre l&#39;incident éventuel comme il le ferait lors des vérifications périodiques normales, et signifier le résultat à la partie client.</p>

 title : The boling-for-batches Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Boling For Batches v1.0.2Plugin for RailsI often need to execute really large computations on really large data sets.  I usually end up writing a rake task to do it, which calls methods in my models.  But something about the process bugged me.  Each time I had to re-implement my &#39;batching code&#39; that allowed me to not chew up GB after GB of memory due to klass.find(:all, :include =&gt; :everything_under_the_sun). Re-implementation of the same logic over and over across many projects is not very DRY, so I got out my blow torch and lit it up.  The difficulty was that the part that was different each time I batched was at the center of the code, right in the middle of the batch loop.  But I didn&#39;t let that stop me! </p>

<p>   [O] means the batch was skipped due to an offset.    [L] means the batch was skipped due to a limit.    [P] means the batch is processing.    [C] means the batch is complete. and yes... it was a coincidence.  This class is not affiliated with &#39;one laptop per child&#39; LicenseCopyright (c) 2008 Peter H.

 title : The bonnie-64 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bonnie, originally written in 1989-90 when I was in the employ of the Oxford English Dictionary project, is a C-language benchmark measuring the performance of Unix filesystems.  There is some discussion at http://www.textuality.com/bonnie. </p>

<p>There is another version of Bonnie, Bonnie++, developed by Russell Coker, which appears both at http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/ and http://sourceforge.net/projects/bonnie/ - it is in C++ and includes many tests that Bonnie doesn&#39;t.  It works around the 32-bit limit by scattering the data across multiple files. </p>

<p>Bonnie64 is a slight rev of the original Bonnie, designed to run on 64-bit computers.  Also the output is a bit more useful since it reports in M/sec rather than K/sec.  Its construction is discussed at my blog see http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/16/Bonnie64 and http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/07/ZFS</p>

 title : The brightcontent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bright Content is a lightweight, RESTful [1] content management platform written in Python from reusable components. Its most common use is as a Weblog engine. It is based on a simple, coherent philosophy for content architecture, and reuses sound Web standards and software components to avoid over-architecture and code bloat.   </p>

<p>Bright Content offers many of the usual features of Weblog engines and other content engines, but its basic operation and plug-in model is based on the WSGI standard for Python Web components. Many existing WSGI components can be plugged directly into Bright Content in order to enhance its operation, and Bright Content also has a set of specialized components for common content needs. </p>

<p>Bright Content also builds on the Atom Syntax, Atom Protocol, and an XML data flow. XML is used modestly (e.g. not for configuration) and is intended as much as possible not to get in the way. Built-in templates are XSLT for now, but support for plug-ins providing other templating systems is in the near-term roadmap. </p>

<p>This project is in public repository since Sep 2008. It&#39;s been created in the first half of 2007, while flex sdk was still in beta. First deployed project using it was an interface for BBC Scottland, dating back to July 2007. So don&#39;t dare calling this &#39;new&#39;, please. </p>

<p>&quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted&quot; - Fyodor Dostoevsky, in The Brothers Karamazov </p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Everything is permitted&#39; does not mean that nothing is forbidden...&quot; / &quot;One can be virtuous through a whim&quot; - Albert Camus, in The Absurd Man </p>

<p>BTween is aimed to provide both a very strict and verbose syntax - which motivated me to write this api - and a very loose, quick&#39;n&#39;dirty one. </p>

<p>First one is intended to comply with the complexity of current flash/flex applications, which will benefit from the tighter use of good OOP practices and patterns. Second is given to the simple uses we still may have of flash - you certainly won&#39;t want to loose time creating a fully standardized and documented application when coding a simple banner, for example. I strongly disrecommend the use of long chains of tweens in a single line for a serious application, as well as I recommend the use of the regular Event model in most cases, and the instantiation of BTween objects instead of the &quot;static calls&quot; way. </p>

<p>So this looks good to me: </p>

<p>var tween:BTween = new BTween();
<br/>tween.queue(trace,&quot;I&#39;m a callback&quot;);
<br/>tween.add({target:blueBall,y:100});
<br/>tween.add({target:redBall,y:200});
<br/>tween.start();While this might be good for a banner that will be sent to trash after a couple of days of use </p>

<p>BTween.make().start({target:blueball,y:10},{target:redBall,y:200}).queue(doSomething);With this being an intermediary approach: </p>

<p>var tween:BTween = new BTween();
<br/>tween.queue(doSomething);
<br/>tween.start({target:blueball,y:10},{target:redBall,y:200});This flexibility haven&#39;t made of BTween a sumo fighter, though. The minimal footprint is around 3k, making it light enough to be used in banners or other weight-sensitive uses. The API is also meant to be easily extensible, you can actually code your own extension in a few minutes, implementing IProperty or ISequenceable interfaces. </p>

<p>BTween is in ALPHA state, though I&#39;ve been using it for almost an year, and even its design is being improved each day. If anyone is interested in helping, I&#39;d be happy to give commit rights. Just contact me. </p>

 title : The buildobjects Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>buildobjects provides a number of java classes that allow you to code your build process in  a truly object oriented fashion. It is not forcing you into a certain way of structuring your code and projects. Instead it aims at providing useful building blocks. </p>

<p>The rationale for using java was the availability of the full tool support to th build script. So when using buildobjects you get completetion, search for usage, and a fully featured debugger. </p>

<p>Getting StartedDownload and install buildobjectsGet the buildobjects-dep.jar from the downnloads section.  Put the file into the local file system and create and an alias or a script to run it: alias bo=&quot;java -jar /pathtobuildobjects/buildobjects-dep.jar&quot;Make sure that you are using java 6. </p>

<p>Getting the project set upThe project to be built looks somewhat like this: </p>

<p>|-- build
<br/>|   +-- Build.java
<br/>|-- lib
<br/>|   |-- some.jar
<br/>|   +-- more_dependencies
<br/>|-- src
<br/>|   +-- Sources go here...
<br/>+-- test
<br/>    +-- Test srouces go here...The build older contains the actual build script. A minimal build script looks like this: </p>

<p>import org.buildobjects.BuildBase;
<br/>import org.buildobjects.artifacts.Classes;
<br/>import org.buildobjects.artifacts.FileLocation;
<br/>import org.buildobjects.artifacts.Location;
<br/>import org.buildobjects.projectmodel.JavaModule;</p>

<p>public class Build extends BuildBase {
<br/>    private JavaModule module;</p>

<p>    public Build() {
<br/>        Location location = new FileLocation(&quot;.&quot;);
<br/>        Classes libraries = location.jarDir(&quot;lib&quot;);
<br/>        module = new JavaModule(tasks, location, libraries);
<br/>    }</p>

<p>    public void build() {        
<br/>        build.publish(module.publishable());
<br/>    }
<br/>    
<br/>    public static void main(String[] args) {
<br/>        new Build().build();
<br/>    }It is a good practice to have a separate project in your IDE setup for the builds. This includes the buildobjects-dep.jar on the classpath. </p>

<p>How to run?To trigger your build form the IDE you can just execute the main method in the buildfile.  To run a build from the command line the buildfile has to be compiled. Fortunately the buildobjects Tasklets do the job for you: </p>

<p>bo -source build BuildAfter running the build you will see a new directory appearing: </p>

<p>|-- target
<br/>|   |-- 20081106-145511-build.1
<br/>|   |   |-- SUCCEEDED
<br/>|   |   |-- index.html
<br/>|   |   +-- testproject-simple
<br/>|   |       |-- test-results.txt
<br/>|   |       +-- testproject-simple.jar
<br/>|   |-- environment.json
<br/>|   +-- index.htmlThe target folder is associated with the build environment in which the builds happen. It has an index.html listing all the builds (as well as a json keeping things like the last buildnumber. For each build a new folder is created, that has all the buildresults. </p>

<p>To see what this build actually published have a look at the JavaModule class. It is expected that projects will define their own JavaModule class. If it is put in the build folder it will be compiled when the build is run. </p>

<p>The example use here is available via svn: http://buildobjects.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example/testproject-simple.</p>

 title : The bulk-loader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BulkLoader is a minimal library written in Actionscript 3 (AS3) that aims to make loading and managing complex loading requirements easier and faster. BulkLoader takes a more dynamic, less architecture heavy aproach. Few imports and making heavy use of AS3&#39;s dynamic capabilities, BulkLoader has a one-liner feel that doesn&#39;t get in your way. </p>

<p>BulkLoader hides the complexity of loading different data types in AS3 and provides a unified interface for loading, accessing and events notification for different types of content. </p>

<p>This library is licensed under an open source MIT license. Features: </p>

<p>Connection pooling.  Unified interface for different loading types.  Unified progress notification.  Events for individual items and as groups.  Priority   Stop and resuming individually as well as in bulk.  Cache management.  Statistics about loading (latency, speed, average speed).  Various kinds on progress indication: ratio (items loaded / items to load), bytes , and weighted percentage.   Configurable number of retries.  Configurable logging.   Various assest types (XML, NetStreams, Swfs, Images, Sound, Text Files) </p>

<p>Design goals: </p>

<p> Minimal imports.  Few method to learn.  Consistent interface, regardless of content type. </p>

<p>BulkLoader gracefully handles progress notification in these use cases: </p>

<p> Few connections to open: bytes total can be used instantly.  Many connections opened: progress by ratio  Many connections opened for data of widely varying sizes: progress by weight.</p>

<p>WHY BUNDLE-FU IS SPECIALWeb 2.0 sites have lots of tiny javascript/css files, which causes one extra round trip per file to the server and back!  This is bad!  Bundle-fu throws it all up into a big package and sends it out all at once.   </p>

<p>Bundle-fu can speed your load time up around 50%. </p>

<p>It: </p>

<p>Does not require a separate config file Automatically regenerates the bundle if you modify an included file, or change the include order. Is easily bypassed by passing &quot;?bundle_fu=false&quot; into your page (including assets separately vs bundled).  It does not affect other users of your site, and stays bypassed for the your session only.  Bundle-fu makes debugging fun! Is optimized for production mode (only generates the bundle file once when the server is first started). Puts the bundles in javascripts/cache and stylesheets/cache, so it&#39;s easy to ignore with subversion. Rewrites relative URLs in your CSS files, so you&#39;ll never have broken images. Minimizes your javascripts by default using the Ruby Version of JSMin.  Optionally, if you install PackR, it will automatically use that instead. No additional requests on your rails application - bundled files are served as static files. Supports multiple combinations of JS/CSS, using the :name parameter USAGE / INSTALLATIONStep 1Install this plugin </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/timcharper/bundle-fu.git vendor/plugins/bundle-fu &amp;&amp; rm -rf vendor/plugins/bundle-fu/.gitStep 2Put the following around your stylesheets/javascripts (note it works with any method of including assets!): </p>

<p>  
<br/>    ...
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    ...
<br/>  That&#39;s it! </p>

<p>HELPGeneral Documentation Read the FAQ and CAVEATS Post to the mailing list OTHER RUBY ON RAILS ASSET BUNDLERSBundle-fu isn&#39;t the only Ruby on Rails plug-in that will bundle assets.  It simply has a new approach to doing so. </p>

<p>Other asset bundling solutions: </p>

<p>AssetPackager - Requires a separate config file to work.  Option to compress javascript. Rails 2.0 - Very clean implementation.  Doesn&#39;t rewrite relative CSS urls.  Bundles only in production mode.  Doesn&#39;t bundle includes from asset include helpers from 3rd party plug-ins.  No bypass mechanism (though it could be implemented easily).  No js minification.

I&#39;m also looking into getting Jython working support but I have not had time yet. </p>

<p>How it WorksCreate an XML configuration document to setup the resource(s).  Then create a JRuby script to initiate the request and send/receive data from the web resource(s) you setup in the configuration. The you can either embed the script in the xml configuration file or link to it from the config file.</p>

 summary : <p>OverviewBushel provides utility classes for Ant Ivy that allow a developer to use a directory of OSGi bundles as a dependency repository. It does this through a custom metadata parser that converts a MANIFEST.MF file into a valid ivy.xml. The aim is to assist IDE-free OSGi development and continuous integration best practice.  </p>

<p>Current limitations are that Import-Package and Export-Package parameters in the manifest file are ignored, however Require-Bundle is honoured. </p>

<p>ExampleThe Bushel example bundle is based on the Eclipse PDE/New Plug-in Project/OSGi Simple LogService Example. </p>

<p>It includes all the Ant and Ivy scripts required to compile and run the bundle, and can be used as a template for your own project. </p>

<p>To use the Ant script, you must provide the path to the Eclipse home dir (the parent dir of the plugins/ dir) using -Declipse.home=/path/to/eclipse. It provides the following targets: </p>

<p>ant compile - Compile your bundle using Ivy to generate the classpath. ant bundle - Package your bundle jar ready for deployment. ant run - Run your bundle in equinox in console mode. Try ss, or diag 2, or help, and then finally close, to exit. </p>

<p>TODOImport-Package/Export-Package support. Examples with other OSGi containers (Felix, Knoplerfish etc). Eclipse Update site support. Check out the project Issues for more detail. </p>

<p>...Other DetailsBy default, migrations are loaded from the directory src/main/db/migrations and follow the naming convention yyyymmddhhmmss_some_description.sql.  Version history is stored in the database in the schema_version table, which captures the version, date-applied, and how long it took for the migration to execute for each applied migration. </p>

<p>Supported DatabasesAll functionality is supported for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, HSQL, and H2Database, though the migrate functionality is likely to work with many other database systems.  Create/drop/reset are less likely to work out of the box.  Our goal is to support all of the major database systems and we&#39;re eager to hear how it works with other systems. </p>

 title : The cabbie Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Cabbie?Cabbie is a PHP Model-View-Controller framework that borrows its ideas from Ruby on Rails and emulates a lot of its features. Cabbie is sponsored by Works4all (http://works4all.nl) and was written for their Wiban project. </p>

<p>Why Cabbie?Because we can, and because: </p>

<p> Cabbie </p>

<p> :P </p>

<p> how&#39;d you come to pick it? </p>

<p> Because it&#39;s a spin on the name Filing Cabinet </p>

<p> which is how an SQL DB works </p>

<p> clickity click </p>

<p> its done. </p>

 title : The cachecontrol Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Why?There are many caching frameworks out there - this isn&#39;t one of them. Instead it aims to make it as simple as possible to use caches without worrying about thread safety and cache invalidation or having to reinvent the wheel and repeat common mistakes. </p>

<p>LightweightIt&#39;s deliberately not heavyweight or comprehensive. There&#39;s no need. We want to make sure that simplicity outs. The APIs are named like a Cash Machine. Likewise, control of caches is split up - one set of APIs for those asking for caches, and another or those controlling them. It should be blindingly simple to write your own wrappers for your favourites. There are no dependencies apart from Java 5! </p>

<p>IoCInversion of Control is a powerful paradigm in helping to write easily tested, highly coherent, loose couplings of objects. We&#39;ve designed this API to best suit Constructor Injection. We also make use of a closure-like approach to visit things! </p>

<p>Where did Cache Control come from?Inspired by the humane interfaces and compelling simplicity of projects such as Ruby, XStream, Hamcrest and Rehersal. Many thanks to Joe Walnes for showing us the &#39;BetterHashtable&#39; - a lesson never forgotten... Like all good libraries, this one&#39;s come out of a real problem we once had to debug for days!</p>
 title : The cachedassets Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CachedAssetsRails plugin to intended to help reduce the number of HTTP requests when loading static assets like stylesheets and JavaScript files. </p>

<p>InstallationTo get the latest version: </p>

<p>  script/plugin install http://cachedassets.googlecode.com/svn/trunkUsageInstead of using the default Rails helpers like </p>

<p>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &#39;scaffold&#39; %&gt;use: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= cached_javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= cached_stylesheet_link_tag &#39;scaffold&#39; %&gt;The key here is to have as few of these statements as possible because the plugin will  make a single asset from the list of sources. </p>

<p>So, if you might have something like: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag &#39;lightbox&#39; %&gt;
<br/>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag &#39;yui/yahoo-min&#39;, &#39;yui/event-min&#39;, &#39;yui/treeview-min&#39; %&gt;then you want to combine them into a single statement, like so: </p>

<p>  &lt;%= cached_javascript_include_tag :defaults, &#39;lightbox&#39;, &#39;yui/yahoo-min&#39;, &#39;yui/event-min&#39;, &#39;yui/treeview-min&#39; %&gt;</p>

 title : The cafe-grader Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This software was used in APIO&#39;08.  It currently has mainly two components: the web submission system and the grader.  The web app uses Ruby on Rails; while the grader was written in plain Ruby.  It also uses the sandbox developed by Martin Mares as part of the MO Contest Environment. </p>

<p>We have moved to Gitorious. </p>

<p>Currently, we are combining the two main components (i.e., the web interface and the grader) so that all administrative tasks (including problem uploading and grading) can be done by web interface. </p>

<p>If you can read Thai, see this for installation. </p>

<p>For general specification (a bit out-dated) of the grader see its specification.   For installation, see this for web interface (again, quite out-dated, as for now an easier way is to use Phusion Passenger), and this for the grading system (or judge) (also out-of-date).</p>

 title : The calcti4perl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewA bindings compatible NSControl subclass which draws a calendar much like the one sported by the iPhone. The project also includes AFWeekView designed to eliminate having to use checkboxes to represent days. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>AFCalendarControl exposes five bindings: </p>

<p>AFCurrentMonthBinding, the month to display NSContentBinding; an enumerable collection AFContentDatesBinding; bound to the model subpath for the date property, expects an NSDate object NSSelectedIndexBinding; the index of the selected object in the object returned by NSContentBinding AFDateHighlightedBinding; bound to the model subpath, expects a BOOL wrapped in an NSNumber. If set the control will draw an indicator below the date&#39;s day number. DependenciesMac OS X Leopard 10.5 Objective-C 2.0 Xcode 3.0 CalendarControl is dependent on a framework (AmberKitAdditions) contained inside another one of my projects Amber found at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework which must be available at compile time.  </p>

<p>Using the ControlThe easiest way to use CalendarControl is to instead download Amber.framework which contains all my custom UI controls and the AppKit additions required to use them. </p>

<p>Otherwise you can download the code for this project alone using an svn:external property to pull the &#39;code&#39; subdirectory, i.e. http://calendarcontrol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/application/code, you could also pull the &#39;code&#39; directory from a branch or tag. </p>

<p>Building the ControlIf you checkout the entire project (see &quot;Repository Structure&quot; below) and are building it from source then the Xcode project must be able to find the Amber Xcode project file. </p>

<p>It expects to find the Amber working copy at the same level as it&#39;s own working directory. It must also be able to link the framework; the two projects should either share their build products directory, or you must set custom header search paths. See here http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2008/Sep/msg00268.html for more information. </p>

 summary : <p>CalendarDateSelect is semi-light-weight (about ~20k of javascript/css) and easy to use (but gets even lighter with bundle-fu)!  It takes full advantage of the prototype.js library, resulting in less code, but maintaining a great deal of functionality.</p>

<p>Some of it&#39;s capabilities: can pick a date, or a date-time, or a date with an optional time, as a popup selector or an embedded calendar!   speaks several different formats is easy to localize is extensible.  Calendar Date Select doesn&#39;t do everything under the sun (which is a good thing), but you can build on top of it.</p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE: http://yeti-factory.org/2008/2/28/sleeping-mongrel-handlers  May be of interest to people who want to further research the effect of a bulk of sleeping mongrel handlers on their server.  In testing, the Rails app showed to still be responsive while the threads were sleeping (granted, the trivial code).  More anecdotal production use notes are still required, tho.  Also:  in the testing, the server showed itself to eventually reach an error condition with &quot;too many open files&quot; caused by the number of sleeping threads.   This was at the 200 simultaneous threads point. </p>

<p>can has chat is a plugin for Ruby on Rails that allows you to easily plugin messaging functionality to your app using XMPP4R.  The plugin uses a separate dRuby server to receive chat events, and can optionally use a provided Mongrel handler script to use pseudo-server-push style communication that eases the load that server polling (also supported) would cause. </p>

<p>can has chat requires the JSON and XMPP4R gems, and a working Jabber server (http://www.ejabberd.im/, http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp).  Use of the server-push script requires Mongrel.  Chats with users of non-Jabber transports requires your Jabber server to be configured with transports for those networks, as well as a valid username and password for each chatter on that network.  If you wish to use anonymous jabber authentication, you&#39;ll need to use the trunk version of XMPP4R. </p>

 title : The canviz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Canviz is a JavaScript library for drawing Graphviz graphs to a web browser canvas. More technically, Canviz is a JavaScript xdot renderer. It works in most modern browsers. </p>

<p>Using Canviz has advantages for your web application over generating and sending bitmapped images and imagemaps to the browser: </p>

<p>The server only needs to have Graphviz generate xdot text; this is faster than generating bitmapped images. Only the xdot text needs to be transferred to the browser; this is smaller than binary image data, and, if the browser supports it (which most do), the text can be gzip- or bzip2-compressed. The web browser performs the drawing, not the server; this reduces server load. The user can resize the graph without needing to involve the server; this is faster than having the server draw and send the graph in a different size. There is the potential to offer other features: </p>

<p>Mouse-over and mouse-out events to allow changing attributes (color, size, etc.) of portions of the graph Animations between graph states (see issue #26) A draggable interface like Google Maps for exploring large graphs (see issue #22) Please join me in the Canviz discussion group if you&#39;d like to use or help develop Canviz. Canviz can draw all the sample graphs provided with Graphviz and even supports other features not represented there, but Canviz is not finished yet and is still undergoing changes, sometimes drastic ones. I welcome you to use Canviz in your projects, but recommend that you also subscribe to the Canviz changes and Canviz issues groups so you can learn about changes to Canviz that might affect how you use it.</p>

 summary : <p>SummaryCapture Me is a flexible screen capture and recording utility for Mac OS X which features a floating capture window, several saving options, and resize ability. </p>

<p>DetailsTo use the program, drag and resize the floating window to cover the area you want to capture. Then click in the window to capture the screenshot. You can resize it, copy it to the clipboard, and save it in a variety of formats and locations. Its behavior is customizable with respect to what happens after a capture. A newly added movie recording mode now allows up to a one minute long QuickTime movie (no sound) to be produced. </p>

<p>What advantage does Capture Me hold over the built in OS X screencapture facility? For some tasks, the answer is simple - there is none - the built in screen shot is elegant and easy to use. However, there are occasions when it&#39;s nice to be able to choose what file format your capture saves in, copy it to the clipboard without holding down four keys at once, or resize it on the fly. It&#39;s also common to want to take successive shots of the exact same position on the screen without moving the capture region at all, or make all your captures the same size. These tasks are trivial with Capture Me, but difficult at best with the built in utilities. Another possible use is as a floating capture pad - see the comment below for an example of one user who does this. </p>

 summary : <p>CakeCMS (previously named Capuchn CMS)
<br/>CakeCMS is an open source content management software (CMS) built using the CakePHP framework and the Dojo javascript toolkit. CakeCMS aims to be as simple to use as Wordpress for the end user (site admins) while offering a developers an easily extendable framework to create rich websites. </p>

<p>Features: 
<br/>Fully-featured image gallery 
<br/>TinyMCE editor 
<br/>Integrated Simple themes 
<br/>Quick development using MVC framework 
<br/>Integrated email client 
<br/>Email to post (with pictures) 
<br/>Single page, full-ajax admin page</p>
 summary : <p>The aim of this project is to implement an online system to manage car pooling. Users can register for the service. To prevent spam, user registration is safeguarded, for instance by new users having to type in a code displayed in a blurred image, or by sending a confirmation email to users. To facilitate user registration, users can use existing OpenID compliant user accounts (such as blogger ids and yahoo email addresses). Users can add locations, these are points where cars stop to pick up/drop people. Optionally, locations can be associated with maps (google maps, trademe smaps etc). Users can offer rides, and users can browse rides offered by others and accept them. For instance: </p>

<p>John offers a ride for Wednesday 8:30 from Linton school to Massey, back starting at 16:30 from the ecology car park. James accepts this and meets John at the car park.  </p>

<p>Users can register a google calendar with the system. If they do, ride information will be copied automatically to their calendar. Users can then setup the calendar to send them notifications about the rides (like an SMS message or email ½ hour before).  </p>

<p>Ride information is kept in a central database. For each user a “social score” is calculated (dream up your own formula) indicating whether the user actively contributes to the car pool or is only leeching.</p>

 summary : <p>Caramel: a RedCloth enabler for RailsCaramel is a Ruby on Rails plugin that facilitates conversion of Textile input to HTML via RedCloth. </p>

<p>Problem:If you have a text field, say &#39;content&#39;, in your model and you intend to use that text field to contain the HTML for your web pages, then either the user of your web app must know HTML or else you&#39;ll have to convert the user&#39;s input from some other format like Textile. </p>

<p>The latter solution is quite attractive, and on top of that there is a great Ruby gem out there that does this conversion for you in a very easy way! It&#39;s called RedCloth and it works with Markdown as well. </p>

<p>But if you store the Textile markup in the database and convert it using RedCloth, you end up with a lot of processing overhead which will almost certainly get scary if your website gets popular. On the other hand, if you convert the Textile and then save the HTML to the database, you&#39;re back to forcing the user to learn HTML if he/she ever wants to go back to make edits. </p>

<p>Solution:Store BOTH Textile and HTML! Sure, this doubles the amount of data you have to store in the database, but storage is much more affordable than man-hours and per-request processing expenditures. </p>

<p>But who wants to go to the trouble of defining a before_save callback with RedCloth configs for each and every HTML-based column in your database? Enter Caramel. </p>

<p>Caramel is designed to make it very easy to instruct your model on which database columns will be used to store the Textile markup and which columns will be used to store the HTML. Caramel adds a method to ActiveRecord which looks for  certain naming conventions in your tables (or responds to the developer&#39;s configuration within the model) and then sets up a before_save callback based on your model. </p>

<p>Installation:Get to the command line, navigate to your plugins directory on your rails app, and then type in the following to install Caramel via anonymous checkout: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://caramel-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ caramelNote: This will install the very latest version of Caramel, which might be untested or even unstable. As stable, tested versions become available, I will make an effort to post milestones here. Until then, please feel free to use the trunk version, which as of writing seems very stable although untested. </p>

<p>Please also see the Usage section below, since you&#39;ll have to make some accommodations in your database. </p>

<p>Usage:For any columns in your database that you would like use for HTML, simply create a column for Textile storage and a column for HTML storage: </p>

<p>create_table :web_pages do |t|
<br/>  t.column :content, :string
<br/>  t.column :content_html, :string
<br/>end...and in your model, Caramel takes care of the rest with 1 method call: </p>

<p>class WebPage &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  caramelize
<br/>endIf you want more control over the way that Caramel behaves, of if you simply don&#39;t want to use Caramel&#39;s naming conventions, you can specify which columns to use (and how to treat them) as follows: </p>

<p>class WebPage &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  caramelize
<br/>  @@html_columns = [
<br/>    Sweets::HTMLColumn.new(:raw =&gt; :my_textile_column, :cooked =&gt; :my_html_column, :redcloth_options =&gt; [:lite_mode])
<br/>  ]
<br/>endNote that :redcloth_options (optional) accepts any options that can be read as restrictions for RedCloth.new. </p>

<p>Development Roadmap:The biggest changes I would like to make in the near future are as follows: </p>

<p>Write some tests! I&#39;m new to test-driven-development and to testing as well, so although the current implementation has been tested well in production, I see the value of writing a separate test suite and intend to get one rolling in order to facilitate other items in the dev roadmap:  Have the caramelize method accept a block for config rather than reading configuration from a @@ class variable (see activescaffold plugin for a clean example of what I&#39;m talking about). Write an installer for the plugin which generates a migration file and a model file for storing all the HTML in a single table with polymorphic associations instead of requiring that the Textile and the HTML both be in separate columns for each table.</p>

 summary : <p>SADI, and it&#39;s first implementation in CardioSHARE, are a novel Web Services framework that dynamically generates RDF graphs by accessing Web Services.  Web Service discovery is achieved by registering the type of relationship (i.e. the predicate) that the Web Service creates between its input data and its output data. </p>

<p>See an early prototype application demo.  Note that THERE IS NO DATABASE/TRIPLESTORE under these demos!  All data is being discovered dynamically by the SADI system through &quot;semantic interpretation&quot; of the query, followed by discovery of Semantic Web Services capable of generating the data required to resolve the query, automated execution of the discovered Services, retrieval of the resulting triples, and finally resolution of the query using a normal SPARQL query engine (at the moment we are using Pellet). </p>

 summary : <p>Cassia is a .NET library for accessing the native Windows Terminal Services API. It can be used from C#, Visual Basic.NET, or any other .NET language. </p>

<p>What can I do with it?Cassia supports the following operations on both local and remote terminal servers: </p>

<p>Enumerating terminal sessions and reporting session information including connection state, user name, client name, client display details, client-reported IP address, and client build number (WTSEnumerateSessions, WTSQuerySessionInformation, and friends) Logging off a session (WTSLogoffSession) Disconnecting a session (WTSDisconnectSession) Displaying a message box in a session and getting a response from the user (WTSSendMessage) Enumerating all processes (WTSEnumerateProcesses) Killing a process (WTSTerminateProcess) Shutting down or rebooting the server (WTSShutdownSystem) In addition, Cassia supports enumerating all terminal servers on a domain (WTSEnumerateServers). </p>

<p>So, how do I use it?ITerminalServicesManager manager = new TerminalServicesManager();
<br/>using (ITerminalServer server = manager.GetRemoteServer(&quot;your-server-name&quot;))
<br/>{
<br/>    server.Open();
<br/>    foreach (ITerminalServicesSession session in server.GetSessions())
<br/>    {
<br/>        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Session ID: &quot; + session.SessionId);
<br/>        Console.WriteLine(&quot;User: &quot; + session.UserAccount);
<br/>        Console.WriteLine(&quot;State: &quot; + session.ConnectionState);
<br/>        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Logon Time: &quot; + session.LoginTime);
<br/>    }
<br/>}A sample console application demonstrating all of Cassia&#39;s functionality is included in the distribution. </p>

<p>What platforms are supported?Cassia has been tested on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2000. It should work on Windows Vista as well. </p>

<p>But what about the standard .NET Framework library? (Or, why Cassia?)Well, support for the Terminal Services API in the .NET Framework is rather limited. Specifically, the only Terminal Services operations supported in the .NET library are: </p>

<p>Process.SessionId, which retrieves the Terminal Services session ID for a given process. ServiceBase.OnSessionChange, which provides notifications of changes to Terminal Services  sessions in a Windows service. SystemEvents.SessionSwitch, which provides notifications of changes to the session in which the application is running, provided that it is running a message loop. SystemInformation.TerminalServerSession, which tells you whether the calling process is running in a Terminal Services session. </p>

We can make our computer shout &#39;build-------failed!&#39;, or we can make keyboard light blink randomly and quickly, or we just pop up a message to tell ourselves what&#39;s happened with build... </p>

<p>CC Monitor works on RSS of CruiseControl. It also can work on any CI Build Tool which provides RSS to report build status. The default rule to assert successful build is rss item title contains &#39;success&#39;, &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;passed&#39;. </p>

<p>&quot;100% CLEAN&quot; Softpedia award </p>

<p>CC Monitor 1.2 releasedFixed bug: can&#39;t update widget panel UI when refresh widget panel has error </p>

<p>Changed: command &quot;say&quot; will not be asynchronism </p>

<p>Upgrade: can get committers while monitoring CruiseControl 2.7.x. </p>

<p>CC Monitor 1.1 releasedFixed bug: refresh settings page while configuring setting first time </p>

<p>Upgrade: default notifications including display message by Growl, say and display build status will be triggered asynchronism. </p>

<p>CC Monitor 1.0 releasedCC Monitor is upgraded to be a ruby internal DSL runner and needs ruby installed. For previous versions built on javascript eat too much memory and CPU time, the core of CC Monitor is rebuilt on ruby, and the widget will be only used as a view to display build status. After start CC Monitor, a ruby process will be running background. </p>

<p>The simplest script for monitoring a buildobserve build mingle =&gt; &#39;http://server/projects/minlge.rss&#39;This script will display build status icon on your widget. </p>

<p>How CC Monitor worksmap committer names: committers: For user name used to commit code is always abbreviated, you can redefine committer names by keyword &#39;committers&#39;. The user name should be unique in the script and should not be keywords of CC Monitor DSL and ruby, otherwise please put it into double-quotes, see example below. define build: build, def_build: Example: build mingle =&gt; &#39;http://server/projects/minlge.rss&#39;, mingle is build name and should be unique so that we can use it later, and it also works with ruby string, &#39;http://server/projects/minlge.rss&#39; is the rss feed of project. observe build status:  keep eyes on, keep one eye on, observe, observes: See example below. get build status and info: build: Except to defined build, this keyword can used to get build infos when it is inside block of observing build status. See example below. cant load: Example: say growl build message if cant load build new?: Return true if it is first time to get the recentest build. failed?: Return true if the recentest build is failed succeeded?: Return true if the recentest build is succeeded. loaded_error?: Return true if cant load build message: Build message string includes build name and build status. status: Return &#39;loaded error&#39;, &#39;succeeded&#39; or &#39;failed&#39; link: Return build report link url after loaded build. Return build rss url defined if cant load build committers: It is parsed from the recentest build rss item description. It is only supported well when observing CruiseControl.rb build now. refresh: Refresh build status, build will be refreshed automatically when observing it by keywords of observing build status. rss item title: Return the build rss item title. rss item description: Return the build rss item description. succeeded=: Reset build succeeded status, if the default parser can&#39;t parse your CruiseControl rss item title correctlly, you can check rss item title by yourself and use this to reset build result. send out build status message:  display: used to display build status icon or link on widget. Example: display build status icon, display build message link growl: used to send message to Growl Application. Example: tell growl build message say: same with &quot;say&quot; on Mac. Example: say build message, committers any other ruby code Custom CC Monitor scriptcommitters xli =&gt; lee, pwang =&gt; wpc, &quot;build&quot; =&gt; &quot;bu def&quot;</p>

 summary : <p>Ceibal-Chess(La versión en español de esta página se encuentra aquí) </p>

<p>This project is about creating a Chess activity for the Sugar environment to teach kids the basic rules of the game and allow them to play with one another and vs. the CPU. </p>

<p>Ceibal-Chess is a brand new Chess project that aims to produce a chess Activity for the Sugar and the XO </p>

<p>FeaturesFree as in Freedom (GPLv2) Designed from the ground up to work on the XO. Distributed as an Activity Bundle (.xo) Completely developed in Python + PyGame. Integration with GNU Chess. Player vs Player mode (in one Laptop, using DBus planned). Valid movements highlighting. Enemy movements highlighting. Portable: known to work on various Linux distros and Mac OS X. Easy to learn and use, without complex menus or options. The project is still in its early stages, with some known bugs open, but it&#39;s reaching an stage where heavy testing for bug-fixing would be extremely beneficial. </p>

<p>The source code is stored in google code. Anonymous checkout using Subversion is enabled, and the code includes an script for automatically creating the Activity Bundle which can be used to deploy the Activity on XO laptops. </p>

<p>You can contact the project administrator at asegovi AT gmail DOT com. There is also a google group, called ceibal-chess. </p>

<p>DownloadGet the developer beta over here! (recommended) If you have Subversion installed and like living on the edge, get the latest version by using the following command: svn checkout http://ceibal-chess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ceibal-chessRunning on WindowsDownload the developer beta (or get it via subversion), and double click the file called &quot;main&quot; (main.py), after having installed Python. </p>

<p>Running on Linux and Mac OS XGet the developer beta or the latest source code version using Subversion and run the main.py python script. </p>

<p>Installing on the XOFirst get the latest source code version for Linux or Mac OS X, then run the createbundle.sh BASH script. The created .xo bundle will be stored in the bundle/ directory. Copy this file to the XO and open it using Firefox or running the sugar-bundle-install command from the Terminal Activity. </p>

<p>Once installed, restart Sugar by pressing Control + Alt + Erase. The Ceibal-Chess icon should appear among the other activities. </p>

<p>It is also possible to run Ceibal-Chess from the Terminal Activity in the same way that it&#39;s run on Linux, provided you first unset the SUGAR_BUNDLE_PATH environment variable. </p>

<p>For more info, please visit: http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Ceibal_Jam </p>

<p>Hardware RequirementsDesigned to run on the XO, Ceibal-Chess has a small memory footprint and uses little CPU, saving battery life. The minimal hardware requirements to run Ceibal-Chess include: </p>

<p>500 MHz processor. 32MB RAM (64MB recommended). 20MB of free disk space (less when installed in the XO). Software RequirementsCeibal-Chess is developed in the Python programming language using the Pygame graphics library. These are the only requirements. </p>

<p>Python 2.x (not 3.0). Pygame 1.8.1. Notes: </p>

<p>Make sure you download the Pygame library version that matches your Python version. Linux users usually have Python installed and can get Pygame using apt-get or yum. XO users already have both dependencies -no need to install anything-. Windows and Mac users will have to get both packages.  NOT FOR PRODUCTIONCeibal-Chess is still a work in progress and as such, it&#39;s still not ready for prime time. You can expect the application to crash, dumping lots of debug files and might not be for the faint-hearted.

 summary : <p>This project will attempt to combine sensor data from the Android phone with detailed maps of buildings to give indoor directions.  Data sources will include magnetic, orientation, accelerometer, and GPS data.  We hope to build a separate web application to distribute maps to Android phones in an efficient manor.</p>
 summary : <p>In this project, you are asked to write a P2P file sharing software similar to BitTorrent. You can complete the project in Java or C/C++. There will be no extra credit this time for C/C++. The P2P file sharing software should play a role of both a client and a server. </p>

<p>BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. Among its interesting features, you are asked to implement the choking-unchoking mechanism which is one of the most important features of BitTorrent. In the following Protocol Description section, you can read the protocol description, which has been modified a little bit from the original BitTorrent protocol. After reading the protocol description carefully, you must follow the implementation specifics shown in the Implementation Specifics section.</p>

 summary : <p>What is centos-itfchgWhile looking for a way to make the Franklin CDU-680 EVDO USB Modem, I found a piece of code for Ubuntu (which is included in the root of the project) to change mode of the card. This is an adaptation of this code to make it work in CEntOS 4 based on the original C code for itfchg (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=682596) and lshw (http://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter). </p>

<p>What is CFAST?The Consolidated Model of Fire and Smoke Transport, CFAST, is a computer program that fire investigators, safety officials, engineers, architects and builders can use to simulate the impact of past or potential fires and smoke in a specific building environment. CFAST is a two-zone fire model used to calculate the evolving distribution of smoke, fire gases and temperature throughout compartments of a building during a fire. These can range from very small containment vessels, on the order of 1 m3 to large spaces on the order of 1000 m3. </p>

 summary : <p>Log4j Abstract API for ColdFusion.</p>

<p>Log4j Introduction:
<br/>Log4j is an open source Java project that gives the developer the ability to control which log statements are output with arbitrary granularity. It is fully configurable at runtime using external configuration files and most important, it can be utilized within ColdFusion</p>

<p>Project Description:</p>

<p>Coldfusion include log4j internally which is used whenever  tag is employed. However the specified log files can only be saved in a folder which is sometime not accessible (especially in shared hosting). This CFC will enable logging to an arbitary log file without the above mentioned limitation. It also provide additional benefit of setting the max size of the log file created, along with configuration of backup files, the level of logging to output (debug, info, warn, error, fatal), and formatting of the messages.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Author(s) mentioned in the links as without these I am not sure if I could have written this utility.</p>

<p>Comments and feedback are always welcome. Happy logging</p>

 title : The chalkgame Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: They said that the game cabinet uses the arrow keys as the joystick (no change). It may or may not be able to go diagonally. The top three buttons are mapped to QWE and the bottom three are RTY. We can decide which setup works best next time and we can always leave it so that if people play on a keyboard they can use either or/both control schemes. </p>

<p>This is a project that a few of us (currently unnamed) people have begun for the RPI Game Development Club. It is a side-scroller similar to the Simpsons game with the most unique features making this game stand out from all of the rest are the unique storyline and the art style of the game (both of which currently don&#39;t exist, but they will soon!). Please note that our license will change as soon as we discuss which license we want to distribute under. </p>

<p>On a side note, we will release a download when there is something fun to do in the game. Currently, the game does pretty much nothing except moving around. If you feel like playing it, get it from the svn, until we have decided that the game is &quot;done&quot; in some sort of aspect (like you can play level 1). </p>

 summary : <p>A library of tools for writing chess AI&#39;s, as well as servers, clients, and any other software that requires a chess engine. Speaks proper FEN, SAN, and long algebraic notation. Supports standard chess and chess960 (Fischer-random). Handles move validation and checkmate/ stalemate/ repetition/ 50-move-rule checking. Features server-side timekeeping with optional latency compensation. </p>

<p>The compact minimax AI framework utilizes alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables under the hood. This enables the developer to produce a modern custom bot by simply overriding AI.evaluate. Additionally, chesstools.book provides an intuitive interface for building opening book databases for use in conjunction with an ai. </p>

 title : The chronicle-recorder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Chronicle records every memory and register write in the execution of a Linux process, using Valgrind to instrument execution at the machine code and system call level. These events are indexed and compressed; from the resulting database the Chronicle query tool can efficiently reconstruct the state of memory and/or registers at any point during the execution. Additional queries such as &quot;when was the last write to location X before time T&quot; and &quot;when was location X executed between times T1 and T2&quot; are also supported. This infrastructure has a variety of possible uses, but the most obvious use is as the basis for powerful debuggers. </p>

<p>Chronicle by itself is not all that useful to anyone except tool builders. If you&#39;re looking for a useful debugger, try Chronomancer, an Eclipse-based UI for debugging C and C++ programs using Chronicle. </p>

<p>Chronicle is released with the permission of Novell. Thanks Novell!</p>

 summary : <p>The Chronicle framework provides complete register and memory-level recording of Linux processes and efficient queries over the recorded traces. Chronomancer builds on Chronicle by providing a UI for inspecting and querying traces --- effectively an extremely powerful debugger. Chronomancer can display program state for any chosen point in time; find the last write to any given memory location; display the execution path taken through a function (no more stepping!); display correct call stacks in the presence of tail calls or stack corruption; and much more! </p>

<p>Chronomancer supports debugging C and C++ programs with DWARF2/3 debug information such as is generated by gcc. It is implemented in Java as an Eclipse plugin and can integrate with the Eclipse CDT. It offers extension points so other plugins can define new commands, views, event queries, and custom data renderers. </p>

<p>Chronomancer is small, about 10K lines of code, quite new, and has many rough edges and missing features. (There are many features that would be easy to add that no other debugger has ever offered.) However, it can already be used to debug interesting problems; it has already been used to successfully analyze a difficult Firefox garbage collection bug. </p>

<p>Chronomancer is released with the permission of the Mozilla Foundation. Thanks MF!</p>

 summary : <p>Circular-Application-Menu (C-A-M) by Cole Anstey </p>

<p>This is a circular-application-menu (C-A-M) prototype mirroring the same structure as the existing application menu for the GNOME desktop.  This was originally just a paper prototype which I did back in March 2007, and decided to code over Christmas 2007-2008. </p>

<p>Updated </p>

<p>18th May 2009 - Fixed an error where .svg icons were not being used by default over any .xpm alternatives (http://code.google.com/p/circular-application-menu/issues/detail?id=15#c9). </p>

<p>14th May 2009 - Fixed an error where programs were launching and ignoring any arguments (http://code.google.com/p/circular-application-menu/issues/detail?id=15#c5). A command such as the following should now hopefully work &#39;nautilus /home/collie/code/circular-application-menu/&#39;. </p>

<p>4th September 2008 - Added an request to display only one menu at a time (http://code.google.com/p/circular-application-menu/issues/detail?id=7).   The shown menu in the hierachy can be changed via the Page-Up/PageDown/Home and End keys.  Thanks to bitseven. </p>

<p>3rd September 2008 - Fixed an error than some people where experiencing during construction (http://code.google.com/p/circular-application-menu/issues/detail?id=6&amp;can=1).   Thanks to everyone who provided a stack trace. </p>

<p>27th August 2008 - Added a reflection effect by default.  This stresses the processor somewhat; but it can be easily turned off (see below).  Also added a highlight around the edge incase it&#39;s displayed over a black background. </p>

<p>25th August 2008 - Made any &#39;overlapped&#39; portions of a menu by a sub menu translucent by 75%.  This helps to stop the previous visual ambiguity with overlapped menus items merging with the current menu items.  Also changed the small triangle which denoted a sub menu into a glyph to make it easier to differentiate between applications and menu types. </p>

<p>24th August 2008 - Added the ability to specify the emblem to use for the &#39;root&#39; menu.  By default it&#39;s the GNOME logo; but it can now be changed to allow for a specific distro logo.  An Ubuntu one has been provided as an example.  See the &#39;Application Options&#39; section on how to specify your own. </p>

<p>23rd August 2008 - Changed the right mouse button click functionality slightly so it now aligns the currently shown menu to the click coordinate.  Also fixed a bug so it warps the mouse to the centre of the screen when the root menu is initially shown. </p>

<p>28th July 2008 - The menu now uses the blur plugin by default; to blur underneath the menus.  This can be turned off with an optional parameter (see below). </p>

<p>25th July 2008 - Fixed an error that sometimes occurred if the angle for a submenu was over 360.0 i.e. 360.6.  This was a bugger to hunt down as it didn&#39;t ever happen for me, though I got reports that assertions were occasionally happening for other people in this scenario. </p>

 title : The citrixrmsreport Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project aim is to create a tool that can export data or report that Citrix Management Console&#39;s basic report lacks. </p>

<p>Program currently allows user to select multiple servers and extract data all at once. </p>

<p>Program Prerequisite MS Excel (Version 11, AKA Excel 2003) must be installed on the local system to generate the report It does not work with Excel 2007 (v12.0)   .Net Framework 2.0  (Thinking of moving to .net3.x for wpf..) Current VersionVersion 1 </p>

<p>Limits and way it works. use app.config to connect to DB(MS SQL only)  use app.config to list servers   available metrics are hardcoded (this is because there are user based metrics (eg ica-tcp latency) that will enumerate if the program lists the available metrics from DB.  Version 2 Source Code Only, Not yet complete </p>

<p> Export to OpenOfficeXML format  Local install of Excel is no longer required.  Change to GPL (as required by ExcelPackager) </p>

<p>Future VersionTodo on immediate next version </p>

<p> Create Config panel to help user configure the connection and list of servers.  Implment Async call to the DB so that app does not freeze during the SQL call.  (Nearly complete, - see AsyncCallSample in WIKI section) </p>

<p>Todo , wish list </p>

<p> implement better MS Excel handling (eg force save so user may not save for example, servername.xls)  implement datagrid or XML file generator of its own so that excel interop assembly is no longer needed. (see issue section &quot;Excel Compartibility&quot; http://code.google.com/p/citrixrmsreport/issues/detail?id=1 , suggested design change)  Also Export to CSV with Datagrid  use ODBC to attach to RMS server.</p>
 title : The ciui-dev Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a development code base for CiUI. All bug fixes, features and patches will first be checked in here before releasing it as a version to clientside&#39;s repository. </p>

<p>CiUI is an alternate solution to iUI. It is built on the same principles as iUI with a few key differences: </p>

<p>AJAX calls are performed after a page slides DOM doesn&#39;t get overloaded with &quot;pages&quot; as they load. Instead, two DIVs are constantly being reused Page titles are set on the source page, not on the destination page Only specified &quot;a&quot; tags are assumed a part of the UI Some of the features of CiUI include: </p>

<p>Support for forms in two different ways (in-page update or submit to other page) On-demand page caching (via classname annotations)  Pagination (loading more content within one page) </p>

<p>Here are some items on the to-do list: </p>

<p>Create a handle to a custom content processing function. Instead of simply grabbing content of my_page.htm, users will the option to process and display the page content as they wish. Utilize CSS3 transforms and animations to perform hardware-accelerated animations </p>

<p>You can read more information on the announcement blog post here: http://www.clientcide.com/cnet-js-standards/ciui-cnet-iphone-ui </p>

<p>and here: http://ajaxian.com/archives/ciui-cnet-iphone-ui </p>

<p>Also join our group here: http://groups.google.com/group/ciui </p>

<p>Current version is 0.3. Download it here </p>

<p>Release notes </p>

<p>version 0.3 </p>

<p>New feature: page caching.  When you annotate your link with classname cache, i.e. My Page the page will be cached. Meaning, navigating to that page again will not fire a new Ajax request. </p>

<p>Bug Fixes: The cancel function now functions properly (ciUI.cancel()) when you&#39;re trying to cancel a loading page When a new page is requested while the current one is still loading, the current page will stop loading before trying to load the new one. (This was causing unexpected content appear after users navigated away from a page). Fixed an issue with the back button where it would sometimes be disabled when trying to get to the very first page in the hierarchy.  Checkboxes return correct values in Firefox  version 0.2 </p>

<p>New feature: pagination. Load More will load content from loadmorecontent.php and append it to the existing content. This will allow you to do dynamic pagination within page context.  New feature: form processing. Thanks to Aaron Newton for this! There are two ways you can submit a form: . This will submit the form and populate my_element with the output of processform.php.  . This will submit the form, slide to a new page and output results of processform.php to it.  You can find a demo of all features here.  </p>

<p>The code is self-contained, though, and doesn&#39;t have any external dependencies. </p>

<p>Current versionThe current version is 0.0.1. I don&#39;t know if version numbering is meaningful this early, though. </p>

<p>Tested onI&#39;ve run CL-JPEGMETA on SBCL (1.0.?, under Windows XP and Mac OS X (intel)), LispWorks Personal Edition (Windows XP) and CLISP (Windows XP). </p>

 title : The cl-period Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library is partly inspired by Perl&#39;s Time::Period library, but now owes more to the time classes of cfengine.  There was a Ruby Quiz (#114) to do something similar, but they called it a time &quot;window.&quot;  It&#39;s intended for use in long-running — or frequently running — programs whose action may be limited to particular time frames.  For example, if a program is empowered to send me a page I might want to tell it only to do so during work hours. </p>

<p>The library supports two notations for time periods, one lispy, one modeled on cfengine&#39;s classes. </p>

<p>First release (0.01 - you gotta start somewhere) April 18th, 2008.   </p>

 summary : <p>For fun I ported version 3.6.2 of Rogue from C to CL.  According to the roguelike development website: </p>

<p>Rogue 3.6 was released on or about  
<br/>06/16/1981 and was the first version of Rogue ever widely released. 
<br/>PlatformsHas been run successfully on Linux, Mac, and Windows using SBCL 1.0.5. </p>

<p>DependenciesDepends on the CL package CL-NCURSES (version 0.1.4 or higher).  On Windows you need the PDCurses library and elsewhere you need the Ncurses library (version 5.6 or higher). </p>

<p>StatusRuns from CL&#39;s REPL, not the Unix or Windows shells Almost everything works, except: Death screen is wonky Saving works but is a bit hokey Doesn&#39;t implement all the encryption stuff meant to avoid hacking save files (kind of pointless nowadays) Doesn&#39;t implement shelling out (also not as important nowadays)</p>
 title : The cl-rogue Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>eeks to create a collection of macros for extracting and generating relationships between information using ontologies for the Semantic Web, which will leverage DSpace, use Protege as the relationship mapper for OWL generation and be tested using MIT’s Piggy Bank extraction project. This is research using Lisp to develop macros for generating and processing semantic data, similar to RacerMaster, particularly the processing of OWL &amp; RDF vocabularies and establishing relationships faster using functional programming to rapidly generate ontological relationships.  </p>

<p>It is also hoped that this project will apply speed paths based off of research from Eugene Agichtein &amp; Silviu Cucerzan regarding predicting performance of relational extraction tasks (RE). This project seeks to re-create some of the work done by with RacerPro, however the focus of this project will be on developing a language model for Reasoning Systems primarily to allow for an open-source and vibrant community of developers to continue the work of improving reasoning systems to drive the Semantic Web. </p>

<p>The exact idea for this project is presented in a paper: “Building Ontological Data From Lists For Semantic Processing”, which is being readied for Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2006). It relies heavily on s-xml, cl-prevelance and cells. </p>

<p>The project has the following goals: </p>

<p>develop easy to use macros for T-Boxes, A-Boxes, ect. process OWL Lite / OWL DL documents. implement SHIQ. implement the OWL-QL query processing system from RasterPro for compatibility. Plug in to modelers such as Stanford’s Protege.</p>

 title : The cl-soap-uuh Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The current cl-soap package is not handling complicated wsdl files and has no support for automatic lisp interface generation from the wsdl description. This is my experimental tree before tested changes can go upstream into the official tree at http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-soap </p>

<p>Note that this code bears the LGPL with Lisp clarification (aka Lisp LGPL) as detailed at LLGPL, because the LGPL is worded in a very C-centric way that may be misunderstood in the Lisp context.</p>

 summary : <p>CL-STOMPWe use ActiveMQ (a messaging service from Apache mainly used as a JMS solution) at work and I&#39;d like to be able to integrate with it from common lisp.  So, here&#39;s a library for doing just that using the STOMP protocol. </p>

<p>More details later. </p>

<p>Status: I need a few more days before the code is usable.  In other words, what you see is just the first few days struggling with the ideas.</p>

 title : The cl-strings Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>cl-stringsThe package cl-strings contains string functions modeled on Java&#39;s String class for use in SBCL Common Lisp programs.  It depends on Edi Weitz&#39;s regular expression library, cl-ppcre.  The package is designed to be a convenience library familiar to non-lisp programmers. </p>

<p>Although I don&#39;t think this library offers a lot of additional functionality or convenience on top of what Common Lisp already offers, I think it&#39;s useful as a tool for learning how to put together a CL library, and a way to explore the idea that we might come up with libraries similar to other languages as a bridge to new developers. </p>

 summary : <p>This is a basic library for producing SVG files.  It makes simple things easy (well, easier), but makes no attempt to offer the full freedom of SVG, for which you&#39;d be better off using an XML library. </p>

<p>The documentation is done (though I&#39;ll gladly accept suggestions for improvements). </p>

<p>Current release (0.02) on July 3, 2008.  Known to work with recent versions of SBCL and OpenMCL on Linux, OSX and Solaris. </p>

 title : The clarion Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Clarion Open Source @ Google CodeEvery tool has its following. Clarion is a useful and interesting tool in that it can nearly completely insulate its users from the sometimes ugly details of the Windows API. Living within the confines of its generated code can make one exceedingly productive, albeit at the expense of flexibility. </p>

<p>Clarion&#39;s third-party market has always been lively, and has (IMO) made a crucial contribution to the longevity of the product. Add-ons are a welcome  necessity (regardless of your choice of core tool) that ease the process of dealing with large or complex subsystems often needed in product development. Don&#39;t want to become a TCP/IP expert? Catalyst Development&#39;s SocketTools, or CapeSoft&#39;s NetTalk make the dirty work easy. In my mind a socket expert is an excellent mechanic, so I have both tools. </p>

<p>You just can&#39;t buy every gadget you need. </p>

<p>Code Is PoetryTo be truly flexible, one has to write a bit of code now and then. Imagine that! If you&#39;re going to write it, it&#39;s good to share as much as you can. And that&#39;s why this open source project exists. </p>

<p>What is Clarion?Shamelessly Ripped from Soft Velocity&#39;s Web Site Clarion is a software development tool to help you get your business applications  
<br/> completed up to 10 times faster. Clarion features a Template driven Code Generator that 
<br/> automates the creation of complete Database Applications. Clarion features roundtrip Code 
<br/> Generation, which means that it preserves all of your hand-written code while still 
<br/> allowing you to make changes and re-generate your application, or any part of your 
<br/> application, as often as needed. Clarion can help you create higher-quality, more 
<br/> consistent database applications in less time.</p>
