 title : The gpops Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GPOPS (which stands for Gauss Pseudospectral Optimal Control Software) is a MATLAB software that solves optimal control problems using pseudospectral methods.  In particular, GPOPS uses the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) that has been the topic of considerable research at MIT, The University of Florida, and The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.  GPOPS has been made possible in large part due to the excellent doctoral work of Dr. David Benson (Ph.D., Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, 2004), Dr. Geoffrey T. Huntington (Ph.D., Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, 2007), University of Florida graduate students Christopher Darby, Michael Patterson, and Camila Francolin, and Dr. Anil V. Rao.   </p>

<p>The objective of GPOPS is to encourage an open collaboration between those in academia, industry, and government by providing an optimal control software in an open-source format that can be freely modified and adapted to the needs of a particular user.  To this end, the rules for downloading, using, modifying, or distributing GPOPS are simple:  </p>

<p>- Use what you obtain when you download GPOPS; - Give credit to the authors when you publish results using GPOPS; - Improve the code and give back to the community by sharing your contributions with everyone </p>

<p>In this manner, GPOPS can be improved with time, thus enabling the various communities to benefit even more greatly in the future.</p>

 summary : <p>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0730556. Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recomendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation (NSF). </p>

<p>Overview  March 30, 2009: Gpyro 0.704 is available by SVN checkout. Includes material property estimation by hybrid genetic algorithm/simulated annealing optimization. Also includes modifications to FDS/Gpyro coupling related to laminar flame spread. Testing is underway and documentation to be updated soon. </p>

<p>Gpyro is an open source computer model that describes the thermal response of solid materials exposed to radiative or convective heating, including thermo-oxidative pyrolysis of the condensed phase. It is being developed at UC Berkeley under NSF sponsorship as part of a larger project to improve capabilities for CFD-based modeling of fire growth on practical solid combustibles.  </p>

<p>Gpyro can be used for 0D, 1D, and 2D simulations and can write NIST Smokeview files for visualization of 2D simulations. Gpyro contains the physics necessary to simulate pyrolysis of thermoplastic and charring solids, intumescent coatings, and smolder in porous media. It can be applied as a boundary condition in a modified version of FDS (disclaimer: Gpyro and its linking to FDS is in no way supported by or developed by NIST or VTT; the coupled Gpyro/FDS code is being used as part of an active research project). Part of Gpyro is a material property estimation program that can be used to help estimate the required material properties from experimental data (Cone Calorimeter or similar, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry). At the present time, brute force search and genetic algorithm optmization are available, but other optimization methods are being investigated.  </p>

<p>Gpyro is a research code under active development, check this page frequently for updates! A draft Users&#39; Guide and Technical Reference have been prepared and can be downloaded from links to the above right. Please refer to these documents for technical details of Gpyro and instructions for installation and running simulations.  </p>

<p>Gpyro was originally developed at UC Berkeley under NASA sponsorship as part of the Forced Ignition and Spread Test (FIST) project and a Graduate Student Researcher Program (GSRP) extension to FIST. It is now being developed under NSF Award 0730556, &quot;Tackling CFD Modeling of Flame Spread on Practical Solid Combustibles&quot;. Some of the theory, applications, and &quot;validation&quot; of Gpyro, its predecessors, the material property estimation algorithm, and linking to FDS is scattered over several publications listed in the References section below.  </p>

 title : The graffiti-usergroups Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Two plugins, macros and a theme for user groups to manage their events and talks. </p>

<p>ContentsA sample theme Event plugin to manage user group events including metadata like Speaker Location Begin and end date and time Allowed number of registrations Talk plugin to manage talk downloads and slides Two sets of Chalk macros for accessing metadata conveniently InstallationTo try Graffiti-Usergroups just copy the release files to a fresh Graffiti CMS installation. Then log in to the admin control panel and select the Graffiti-UserGroups theme. Go back to the home page and run the installation wizard. The wizard will configure the plugins and create a couple of sample events, talks and a registration page for your visitors. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Watch an introductory video here! </p>

<p>A note on the theme that comes with Graffiti-UserGroupsThe theme included in the download is there to make the initial setup of Graffiti-UserGroups a no-brainer for you. It also provides a reference implementation to show you how to use the Chalk macros included in Graffiti-UserGroups. The theme also includes the ASP.NET handlers (inside \Handlers) for the registration page and the calendar item download. </p>

<p>You may very well use Graffiti-UserGroups with your own theme. </p>

<p>RequirementsGraffiti CMS .NET Framework 3.5 A full trust environment due to a bug in Graffiti CMS 1.0 and 1.1, we need reflection to work around it Tested with SQL Server 2005, but should work with any other database supported by Graffiti CMS as the plugins do not touch the database directly. </p>

 title : The grafx2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GrafX2 is a bitmap paint program that allows you to draw in more than 60 video resolutions including most of the standard Amiga resolutions : 320x200, 320x256, 320x512, 640x256, 640x512, etc. It was written to run under DOS, but the code you&#39;ll find here was modified to use SDL and modern operating systems. </p>

<p>This program is dedicated to everybody who knows what a single pixel is. Its layout is not very different from the famous Deluxe Paint or Brilliance, so it will be quite easy to handle it if you know at least one of these programs. If you aren&#39;t used to the art of drawing with up to 256 colors, it will be a little more difficult for you, but you should give it a try (or more, because most of the power of this program won&#39;t show up on the first try).</p>

 title : The groovy-swinger Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A try for groovier swing programming?!?Currently the original project is splitted into two sub projects: Groovy-Swinger and Groovy-Oracle. The last, Groovy-Oracle, contains some ideas to handle Oracles meta data informations. The original project, Groovy-Swinger, contains an idea to add PropertyChangeEvent handling to a naked Groovy bean. </p>

<p>Groovy SwingerFeature List </p>

<p>Add dynamic PropertyChangeListenerSupport to beans. Example: class Person
<br/>    def name
<br/>    def age
<br/>}</p>

<p>def bean = new Person(name: &#39;Winkler&#39;, age: 24)
<br/>GroovyPropertyChangeSupportBuilder.preparePCLMechanics(bean)</p>

<p>def listener = { event -&gt; println event }
<br/>bean.addPropertyChangeListener(listener as PropertyChangeListener)
<br/>// or
<br/>bean.addPropertyChangeListener({ event -&gt; println event })Add integration for JGoodies Data Binding. Example: // Import the classes from the sandbox...
<br/>import de.gluehloch.sandbox.groovy.bean.*</p>

<p>// Import JGoodies classes...
<br/>import com.jgoodies.binding.adapter.Bindings;
<br/>import com.jgoodies.binding.value.ValueModel;</p>

<p>GroovyPresentationModel gpm = new GroovyPresentationModel(bean)
<br/>ValueModel name = gpm.getModel(&#39;name&#39;)
<br/>ValueModel age = gpm.getModel(&#39;age&#39;)</p>

<p>JTextField nameTextField = new JTextField()
<br/>Bindings.bind(nameTextField, name)</p>

<p>JTextField ageTextField = new JTextField()
<br/>Bindings.bind(ageTextField, age)</p>

<p>person.setProperty(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Andre Winkler&quot;);
<br/>assertEquals(&quot;Andre Winkler&quot;, nameTextField.getText());There is a difference, if you call from Java the Groovy property. See at JavaCallGroovyBeanProperty. </p>

 title : The groovymud Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Groovy Mud is a Java based MUD OS that uses Groovy code for the mud library </p>

<p>RELEASE 0.4 is now out! </p>

<p>You can now try out an installation of GrooyMud (0.4.3)! Connect now on telnet://zeno.biyg.org:2223 !! </p>

<p>The engine allows you to concentrate on writing a MUD in Groovy, rather than having to deal with complex inventory, messaging and movement handling that happens in all MUDS. </p>

<p>It has an example MUD written in Groovy that comes with the engine, so you can use the building blocks to build your own. </p>

<p>GroovyMud is inspired by the LPC style of mud (with special regards and thanks to Nanvent!). The style of the demo mud is retro in feel, and the lib and engine flexible enough to compare with any LPC style driver and mudbase. </p>

<p>DetailsGroovyMud has: </p>

<p>Translation filter, using Google translate NEW! Input and output filter hooks (example is the Translation filter) new! a flexible room and inventory system ASCII splash screen loader a powerful but simple templating engine, with includes JAAS login module and user policies (creator, god, player) character persistence (serialization with the help of XStream). flexible event messaging Spring enhanced Engine setup flexible command intepreter (look, inventory, directions, dest etc) basic Mud actions, look, open, get, drop etc standard exits and doors basic creator commands, clone, moveto, dest etc gamebound shutdown facility Language and Numeric utilities such as pluralize, number to word conversion etc  ANSII Colours area support (using scripts and Grails beanbuilder) complex, event driven, scripted and random behaviours built in Room resets Auto Save Heartbeat mechanism Multi-threaded (although you don&#39;t have to use it..) In the pipeline: </p>

<p>SSH support (Apache Mina&#39;s SSHD when its ready..) example persistent areas OLC More creator commands, directory access I hope you would like to contribute and/or use GroovyMud! If you would just email me and let me know.</p>

 title : The gwinwrap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Easily add motion to your desktop!   </p>

<p>I strongly recommend using this new fix of xwinwrap with gwinwrap--the sticky feature is now fixed so minimizing all will no longer minimize the xwinwrap effect! The link includes a deb; you must UNinstall old xwinwrap before trying to install this version.SVN Installation for Ubuntu users...Choose, set, and run--it&#39;s that simple.A simpler alternative to xwinwrap&#39;s confusing commands, this unofficial chooser panel currently supports both xscreensavers and videos (through mplayer). It offers a few options (opacity and whether to use nice) and starts xwinwrap with a screensaver or video of choice (+ optional arguments). If the chosen screensaver allows the &quot;--speed&quot; option, it will detect that and enable the slider (this is not always reliable). </p>

<p>A few example presets are included, but it&#39;s easy to create your own new effects and save them to use again. </p>

<p>For now, execute it in the directory. It requires xscreensaver and xwinwrap, and mplayer for video support. </p>

<p>TODO (in order of priority)Add a button to show the manpage of the effect the user wishes to use (for easier options reference) Add an Import/Export option so that users can share their own custom presets with others. Detect screensaver arguments and add widgets accordingly, along with a brief description and the name, rather than filename, of the saver (this would be quite a task). Code is written by newbie coder (me), perhaps it needs cleanup.</p>

 title : The gwt-chronoscope Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the open source release of Chronoscope, the charting and visualization platform for GWT, used as the centerpiece of Timepedia&#39;s website. </p>

<p>Chronoscope&#39;s ultimate goals are: </p>

<p>Scalability: To provide a high performance, cross browser platform for visualizing possibly large and complex  datasets. Ease of use:  To enable applications to be built using either GWT or Javascript Scriptability: To allow endusers to create stories around data and share their perspectives with others. Customizability: To give non-programmers intuitive controls over almost every aspect of the look of a visualization. Extensibility: To encourage easy community extension of Chronoscope features (new plot types, new renderers, new canvas backends, etc) Timepedia is developing a collaborative time-oriented search engine with analytic and visualization capabilities. Chronoscope is currently structured around our needs but we hope that opening it up to the community will help it become a well-rounded charting framework. </p>

<p>The free version of Chronoscope is distributed under LGPL Version 2.1</p>
 title : The gwt-commons-logging Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Implementation of commons-logging that fit into the GWT APIA downgrade of the original Apache Commons Logging that fit into the emulated JRE that run in GWT applications.  </p>

<p>Now you can use commons-logging on the client side as you usually use on the server-side. </p>

<p>As logger you can use:  The GWT Shell  gwt-log  GWTx&#39;s java.util.logging </p>

<p>Compiling the sourcesOn the SVN repository you can find the Eclipse project, all you have to do to let him compile is to define (if not yet defined on your Eclipse configuration) a variable named &quot;GWT_HOME&quot; that points where you expanded your gwt binaries. </p>

<p>After you&#39;ve done this, you can rebuild the JARs using the included build.xml. </p>

<p>Using the binariesBuild TimeYou can use directly the jar from the download area or the one generated from the previous step. </p>

<p>Suppose now we want to introduce the commons-logging into a new project (but the same applies to existing projects). </p>

<p>The only thing to do in our GWT Module is to inherit the commong-logging into the gwt.xml, with the logger of choice. This is an example if you choose to log on the GWT Shell: </p>

<p>and this is an example of usage of the library: </p>

<p>package com.mycompany.project.client;</p>

<p>import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
<br/>import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;</p>

<p>import com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint;
<br/>import com.google.gwt.user.client.Window;
<br/>import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Button;
<br/>import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.ClickListener;
<br/>import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootPanel;
<br/>import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Widget;</p>

<p>public class TestLogger implements EntryPoint {
<br/>	
<br/>	private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(TestLogger.class);
<br/>	
<br/>	private Button clickMeButton;
<br/>	public void onModuleLoad() {
<br/>		RootPanel rootPanel = RootPanel.get();</p>

<p>		clickMeButton = new Button();
<br/>		rootPanel.add(clickMeButton);
<br/>		clickMeButton.setText(&quot;Click me!&quot;);
<br/>		clickMeButton.addClickListener(new ClickListener() {
<br/>			public void onClick(Widget sender) {
<br/>				Window.alert(&quot;Hello, GWT World!&quot;);
<br/>				
<br/>				log.info(&quot;Hello, GWT World!&quot;);
<br/>			}
<br/>		});
<br/>	}
<br/>}As you can see, nothing different from using it into a Servlet, an EJB or a POJO. </p>

<p>Anyway I recommend to add also the gwt-commons-logging.jar, this has no influence at build-time, but put automatically the jar at runtime for the GWT Shell. </p>

<p>You can also configure the gwt-log as logger, using this gwt.xml: </p>

<p>	</p>

<p>	Finally you can use also the jdk logger thanks to the GWTx library: </p>

<p>	Remember to set the logging level into the HTML: </p>

<p>		    
<br/>	    RuntimeYou can control the behaviour of the logger at runtime thanks to deferred-binding. Using the &quot;logger&quot; property, you can change it with the parameter on the GET URL: </p>

<p>http://</p>

<p>:/modulePath/moduleName?logger=server </p>

<p>will enable the server logger, and the client will start to send logging level to the remote Logger service. </p>

<p>Now three values are enabled:  server  production  development </p>

<p>Example ProjectYou can find a sample Eclipse project in the SVN or, if you have trouble connecting to it, in the &quot;Downloads&quot; area.</p>

 summary : <p>SummaryLibrary providing easy to use drag-and-drop capabilities to Google Web Toolkit (GWT) projects. </p>

<p>Questions?If you have questions, please post them on http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-dnd and I (or someone else) will try to answer them as best as possible. Using the forum means that others can benefit from any answers and feedback you get. It is always the fastest way to get an answer to a new question. </p>

<p>Is your project using drag and drop?I&#39;d like to know if you&#39;re using gwt-dnd on your project, and how useful (or not) this library is to you. You can send me an email at fred@allen-sauer.com. </p>

<p>Getting started with your own drag-and-drop projectsRead the wiki here: http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dnd/wiki/GettingStarted </p>

<p>Working examplesIf a picture is worth a thousand words, then maybe a working demo is worth 1386 lines of source code? </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FeaturesDrag-and-Drop - classic drag/drop operations for your existing widgets and panels Drag-and-Move - allows user to rearrange widgets within a Panel Non-invasive - No need to extend or implement special library classes or interfaces; just use your existing widgets and panels Any Widget that implements SourcesMouseEvents is draggable. For today&#39;s version of GWT that means FocusPanel, HTML, Image and Label are immediately draggable. Listening for mouse events on other widgets is relatively straight forward. Any Panel can become a drop target. If you need absolute positioning on the drop target, use AbsolutePanel. Quirks mode and Strict mode fully support Inline and Block elements are supported for dragging and as drop targets AbsolutePanel, IndexedPanel, FlowPanel and FlexTable drop targets Drag Handles - grab hold of small part of a larger widget Drag Proxies - Leave the original widget in place while you drag a proxy widget around Veto Capability - Prevent certain operations from happening, causing the draggable to snap back to its original location EventListener for drag-and-drop events via DragHandler interface Many examples with source code OOTB (Out of the Box) provided drag-and-drop or drag-and-move behaviors</p>

<p>DropController                  Description  Example Use   SimpleDropController            For simple drop targets which allows a widget to be dropped on them.  A trash can icon.   AbsolutePositionDropController  Drag-and-Move widgets around an AbsolutePanel.  Moving drawing elements around on a flow chart.   GridConstrainedDropController   Similar to AbsolutePositionDropController, but constrains the position of the draggable widgets to a specified grid.  Allows for &#39;snap to grid&#39; functionality.   IndexedDropController           Allows you to move children among the elements of a supported IndexedPanel. The current GWT version provides this capability for DeckPanel,  HorizontalPanel and VerticalPanel. The included helper class IndexedFlowPanel adds this capability to FlowPanel (although you have to use the helper subclass instead).  WYSIWYG HTML editor.   BoundaryDropController           All drag operations are ultimately constrained by a panel you specify. By default this panel is RootPanel.get() which means you can drag widgets over the entire page.  For use as part of the gwt-dnd implementation.   NoOverlapDropController         Does not allow widgets to overlap when dropped.  WYSIWYG HTML layout editor.   FlexTableRowDropController      Rearrange rows in a FlexTable.  Users rearrange results of a query.   AbstractDropController          Create your own controllers from this base class.  Anything you can dream up.  </p>

<p>Overview of GWT application architecture based on GWT-PFTypical example of GWT application architectureOne of the classical approaches in the software design is a three-level architecture, where higher levels depend on lower: </p>

<p> presentation layer - user interface (UI);  business logic layer (BL);  data access layer (DAL). </p>

<p>In GWT application those layers can be shared between client and server as follows: </p>

<p> On client-side: presentation layer business logic layer data access interfaces (GWT-RPC Client), data classes  On server-server: data access layer implementation (GWT-RPC server) database </p>

<p>The scheme below clearly shows the dependence between packages of each layer on client and server sides. </p>

<p>Component scheme of GWT application architecture based on GWT-PF. Source code allocation example (click on scheme to view full size image).  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>GWT-PF role in GWT applicationA typical requirement for information systems is the development of a large number of similar reference books and forms for data manipulation. These elements are presentation layer components. There are two general approaches to develop them: </p>

<p> Creating of separate classes which represents visual component for each form.  Creating universal visual components that can represent any form of the system. The obvious is the fact that the first variant more labor for a large system. </p>

<p>gwt-pf-ui package is a set of universal visual components, which can be used to display almost any reference books and forms. So when building a system it is possible to use those components, significantly reducing the resources for the development of a presentation layer. </p>

<p>Visual components in gwt-pf-ui works with the business logic via interfaces of gwt-pf-core package. The implementation of business logic and data access layer of the application ill be presented by set of classes implementing interfaces from gwt-pf-core. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Rapid development with GWT-PFIt is obvious that gwt-pf-ui is profitable in terms of code reuse and mostly implemented presentation layer. Moreover the existence of business logic interface with gwt-pf-core applies tested business logic development methodology.</p>

<p>Currently, about 98%  of the jQuery API is written. Most CSS3 selectors are  supported. People feel free to contribute patches to bring the API more in line with jQuery. </p>

<p>This code is beta, so expect it to break. Work remains to refactor and  clean up some of the implementation, provide more unit tests, and better docs.  </p>

<p>Patches welcome! </p>

<p>I would like the thank John Resig for writing jQuery, a kick ass library, that is a pleasure to use, and I hope to capture that feeling in GWT. Also, thanks to Robery Nyman for writing the fastest CSS Selector API implementation (DOMAssistant), which I used as a guide for the GWT impementation. GwtQuery is in large part, a port of DOMAssistant. </p>

<p>I am releasing this under the MIT License in the spirit for Robert Nyman&#39;s choice, since the performance of this library wouldn&#39;t have been possible without him. </p>

<p>I am also releasing this in a form that has no deployable demo (war) hastily for the Google I/O conference. </p>

<p>Thanks, Ray</p>

 title : The gwtsrwc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project GoalProvide a library of simple, reusable, and easy to use GWT widgets.  All of the widgets defined in this project are simple composites or simple extensions of base GWT widgets that I created for one project or another and then found myself reusing elsewhere.  All widgets will build with no third party libraries or other extensions - everything builds on top of the latest official GWT release. </p>

<p>MotivationQuite simply, I just wanted a place to store some of the reusable widgets that I&#39;ve found myself reusing from project to project.  I got sick of copying the same code across projects so I refactored some widgets into a self contained library.  Moving the library to Google Code provides a central location to grab the library from when needed and if someone else finds this library useful along the way then so be it!</p>

 title : The gwtx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of GWTx is to provide drop in support for an extended set of the of the standard Java library classes on top of what is provided by the GWT distribution provided by Google. </p>

<p>New : GWTx 1.5.2 released!  </p>

<p>Fix  &amp;nbsp;issue #18&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;issue  #20&amp;nbsp; </p>

<p>GWTx 1.5.1 released! </p>

<p>This release fix blocking &amp;nbsp;issue #16&amp;nbsp; </p>

<p>This release uses Maven naming convention and is deployed on central under com.google.code.gwt groupId. </p>

<p>Next GWTx release will focus on GWT 1.6 support. </p>

<p>Currently emulated JRE classes include: </p>

<p>java.beans.PropertyChange* and associated listeners java.util.StringTokenizer </p>

<p>New features in 1.5.x : </p>

<p>java.beans.Introspector and java.beans.BeanInfo with (limited) support for java.lang.reflect.Method javax.annotation, including javax.annotation.secutiry javax.persistence javax.validation  java.text  java.util.regexp (be aware Java regexp are not exactly same as JavaScript ones) </p>

<p>Deprecations </p>

<p>java.util.logging emulation has been removed. Logging has better support from the gwt-log project and it&#39;s contribution to GWT Logging API in gwt-incubator. java.io and java.net emulation has also been removed. They were created to support java.util.logging but never became stable enough for large adoption. If you need them, please send your use case to nicolas.deloof_at_gmail.com to get them back in GWTx.  Usage: </p>

<p>Download the GWTx.jar file from the downloads linked on the right of this page and add it to your project&#39;s classpath. Add the inherits to your .gwt.xml:  Use any of the above emulated classes like you normally would. It&#39;s my hope that these classes get included in the official GWT distribution. I also hope that the GWTx project can become the unofficial de facto place to go for additional emulated JRE classes for use in client code that aren&#39;t provided by GWT. </p>

<p>If you wish to join the project and are willing to make sure your contributions are ASL 2 licensed then let me know.</p>

 title : The h5py Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.</p>

<p>It lets you store huge amounts of numerical data, and easily manipulate that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice into multi-terabyte datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy arrays. Thousands of datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and tagged however you want.</p>

<p>H5py uses straightforward NumPy and Python metaphors, like dictionary and NumPy array syntax. You can iterate over datasets in a file, or check out the .shape or .dtype attributes of datasets; you don&#39;t need to know anything special about HDF5 to get started.</p>

<p>Best of all, the files you create are in a standard binary format you can exchange with other people, including those who use programs like IDL and MATLAB.</p>

 title : The habtm-with-deferred-save Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Example: </p>

<p>Room has_and_belongs_to_many_with_deferred_save PeopleLets say you want to validate the room.people collection and prevent the user from adding more people to the room than will fit. If they do try to add more people than will fit, you want to display a nice error message on the page and let them try again... </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t possible using the standard has_and_belongs_to_many due to these two problems: </p>

<p>When I do the assignment to my collection (room.people = whatever), it immediately saves it in my join table (people_rooms) rather than waiting until I call room.save. You can &quot;validate&quot; using habtm&#39;s :before_add option ... but it any errors added there end up being ignored/lost. The only way to abort the save from a before_add seems to be to raise an exception... We don&#39;t want to raise an exception when the user violates my validation. We want validation of the people collection to be handled the same as any other field in the Room model: We want it to simply add an error to the Room model&#39;s error array which we can than display on the form with the other input errors. </p>

<p>has_and_belongs_to_many_with_deferred_save solves this problem by overriding the setter method for your collection (people=), causing it to store the new members in a temporary variable (unsaved_people rather than saving it immediately. </p>

<p>You can then validate the unsaved collection as you would any other attribute, adding to self.errors if something is invalid about the collection (too many members, etc.). </p>

<p>The unsaved collection is automatically saved when you call save on the model. </p>

 title : The hackystat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hackystat is an open source framework for collection, analysis, visualization, interpretation, annotation, and dissemination of software development process and product data. The Hackystat Framework supports three software development communities:    </p>

<p>Researchers.  Hackystat can be used to support empirical software engineering experimentation, metrics validation, and more long range research initiatives such as collective intelligence.   </p>

<p>Practitioners.  Hackystat can be used as infrastructure to support professional development, either proprietary or open source, by facilitating the collection and analysis of information useful for quality assurance, project planning, and resource management.  Educators.  Hackystat is actively used in software engineering courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels to introduce students to software measurement and empirically guided software project management.  Hackystat users typically attach software &#39;sensors&#39; to their development tools, which unobtrusively collect and send &quot;raw&quot; data about development to a web service called the Hackystat SensorBase for storage.   </p>

<p>The SensorBase repository can be queried by other web services to form higher level abstractions of this raw data, and/or integrate it with other internet-based communication or coordination mechanisms, and/or generate visualizations of the raw data, abstractions, or annotations. </p>

<p>A long range goal of Hackystat is to facilitate &quot;collective intelligence&quot; in software development, by enabling collection, annotation, and diffusion of information and its subsequent analysis and abstraction into useful insight and knowledge.  Hackystat services are designed to co-exist and complement other components in the &quot;cloud&quot; of internet information systems and services available for modern software development.  </p>

<p>Hackystat has been under development since 2001, and has had over 50 public releases so far.  The current major release is the eighth major architectural revision.  Hackystat has been used by hundreds of developers world-wide. </p>

 summary : <p>The SensorShell is a &quot;middleware&quot; library that can be used by Java-based Hackystat clients to simplify collection and transmission of sensor data to a Hackystat SensorBase service.  </p>

<p>The SensorShell provides the following facilities: </p>

<p>Data transmission. The SensorShell provides an object-oriented interface that makes it easy for Java-based sensors to specify what sensor data should be sent to a SensorBase server.  The SensorShell takes care of the details of emitting the HTTP calls.  Data buffering.  When a SensorData instance is &quot;added&quot; to a SensorShell, it is not immediately sent to the server. Instead, the instance is added to an internal list, and accumulated SensorData instances are sent in a single HTTP request when the SensorShell receives a &quot;send&quot; command. Automated sending at user-defined intervals. The SensorShell provides a timer-based subprocess that sends accumulated SensorData at a regular intervals (by default, once per minute). Thus, while buffered transmission is intended to avoid excessive HTTP traffic, automated sending ensures that an excessive amount of data does not accumulate on the client-side.  Interactive shell interface.  In addition to a Java API, the SensorShell implements an interactive, string-based command line interface.  This enables the SensorShell to be invoked manually, as well as being useful as infrastructure for non-Java-based tools that can communicate with subprocesses.   Offline data storage.  If the SensorBase cannot be contacted, the SensorShell can cache data locally until a connection is established at some future point in time.  Primary documentation includes the following: </p>

<p>sensorshell.properties  Documents how to set up the sensorshell.properties file.   User Guide  Documents how users can install this system from a distribution.

 title : The haddock-cms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Haddock CMS is an open source framework written in PHP for creating dynamic, database driven web applications. </p>

<p>It has been written and designed by Robert Impey and Saul Howard. </p>

<p>The hope is that the framework should not get in the way of the developer at any time and that its functions should be a welcome relief to the developer rather than something more to learn. </p>

<p>Another aim of the software is that it should be possible to drop code into an existing site without disrupting the existing site. </p>

<p>There are modules that allow for building HTML pages and working with a database in an object oriented fashion. The programmer is not forced to use them. </p>

<p>Haddock CMS is very much &quot;evolved&quot; code that has gone from hacked scripts to design patterns inspired object orientation and back again more times than we can remember. The end result is surprisingly usable and nicely structured. </p>

<p>Haddock CMS is in no way connected with Haddock, the Haskell documentation tool.</p>

<p>After several years (it&#39;s been about 5 since I started this project) of having absolutely no time to work on open source projects, I&#39;m finally attempting to restart HallKeeper (originally hosted at http://hallkeeper.sourceforge.net). Java-based web development is much more exciting now than it was in 2002, and I&#39;m excited to bring the new technologies to bear on a problem-domain that I still think has a real need for a good open source solution. I&#39;ll be using my favorite new framework, Grails, and I hope to have a very &quot;Ajaxy&quot; web interface. Look for exciting things to come! </p>

 title : The hanami Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Hanami ?Hanami is a project driven by the community around the Kohana framework (note: not the core Kohana devs) showing a common-sense or good coding style for a Kohana CMS application </p>

<p>This project aims at building the basic structure of a cms system that allow developers to have a common context in witch to develop modules for a production grade CMS system. </p>

<p>Hanami is a bundle of lib, models, views. Our intention is to create an basic functional, easy extensible CMS that can be the  basement for our projects. </p>

<p>Hanami ams at being a great starting place the next time you need to develop a cms for a client.  </p>

<p>Project statusThis project has just been set up. We are in the initial faces and have to define the &#39;playing field&#39;. We are in the process of defining what Hanami should do &#39;out of the box&#39;. Please tell us , what would be your ideal starting point for a cms?   </p>

<p>If you want to help just pick an item from the todo list and get in touch.  The debate on the nature of this project is currently  taking place in this category in the Kohana forum  generously provided by the Kohana team. The results of these discussions will the posted here in condensed form so we have some structure for the project. </p>

<p>To do listCreate a &#39;roadmap&#39;,  &#39;master plan&#39; , The concrete actions needed to achieve Goal.  Lay out some &#39;milestones&#39;. Errant and others have made inroads. Break project up into smaller assignments that one person can work on.  How should Hanami be structured? Put conventions into words. Write Hanami &#39;Upgrade policy&#39;. How do we handle the steady flow of new versions of Kohana in the future. Start coding ! Create an actual commonly used module. Project goalsDebate is on in the forum </p>

<p>This is a &#39;work in progress list&#39; </p>

<p>Hanami is a simple generic starting-point for a CMS.  The most basic and commonly used cms features should work out of the box.  Hanami is about speeding up the development process. Hanami is driven by the Kohana community. (note: not the core kohana devs, this is a separate project from Kohana). Anyone can contribute as long as they follow the co-operation guide-lines . Hanami is built with the Kohana framework following the  upgrade policy (yet to be defined) Hanami is modular. Because Hanami is a common context and modular Hanami can be a place for developers to share code an avoid that everyone has to &#39;reinvent the wheel&#39;. Hanami is place to share good coding practice and learn from each other. Hanami will use convention over configuration. Hanami has to be relatively simple &#39;Tools that you don&#39;t understand are of no use&#39;. Hanami should use OOP features of PHP5. Hanami is should use the MVC pattern. The more precise and detailed we can make this list the easier it will be to realise I think. Please add or subtract bullet points. All your other posts are not forgotten I just haven&#39;t had time to traverse them all and extract all the goodies </p>

<p>What should Hanami do as an application out of the box ?A concrete feature-list. (terribly incomplete) </p>

<p>have nice models (should we use ORM?) authentication and acl of some kind User management of some kind. Hanami should have an administration interface and a &#39;recommended&#39; way of building it. (that is not based on Forge or Formation but Coded  manually, or using helpers, models or whatever ) Suggestions from the forum: </p>

<p>static pages with basic version control (restoring pages, seeing what is changed, ..) hierarchical pages (for example a page about photography (/page/photography) and its &#39;children&#39; pages (aperture (/page/photography/aperture), HDR (/page/photography/HDR), ...)) </p>

<p>Low hanging fruitThis is a list a classes or resources or building blocks that already exist within the community that with a little tweaking could be used in Hanami. </p>

<p>dlibs learning Kohana blog The Kohana modules repository Some folks have suggested use of modules or classes they have already written I will traverse the forum and collect all these suggestions so we can discuss them. ixmatus has ported the Zend ACL to kohana see this thread mkjems has a class for creating sucker-fish-type mark-up for easy menu generation.  more comming... please suggest.   </p>

<p>Quality insuranceHow do we keep code clean and quality high? -Text comming- </p>

<p>Road map/ Milestones, Master plandiscussion going on here </p>

<p>Establish some sort of authentication enhancing the existing Kohana Auth so that it can be given back to Kohana  Expand work on models already started by Errant. Should we use ORM ? Coding styleWe use the same coding style as Kohana   </p>

<p>Basic application structureThat Hanami is split in two application folders &#39;frontend&#39; and &#39;backend&#39; with one system folder and one Modules folder. Access to the two apps is done via .htaccess rewriting.  index.php loads &#39;frontend&#39; application. admin.php loads  &#39;backend&#39; app. The backend is accesed through the subdomain: admin. (ex: admin.hanami.dev) The frontend  is accesed through www.hanami.dev The Hanami nameWe have a name: Hanami  ! Witch is japaneese for &#39;flower watching &#39; or &#39;enjoying flowers&#39; Kohana means &#39;little flower&#39;. Yes I know.. it&#39;s very clever :) LicenseHanami will use the new  BSD license.   </p>

<p>ConventionsHanami will be &#39;Convention over configuration&#39;. Hanami will use Kohana svn trunk (soon to be Kohana 2.2)  Hanami uses: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;Suggestions for conventionsvalidation should be done in the model. I think it&#39;s also wise to enforce a views convention. Best would be the standard controller to view mapping. So &#39;localhost/blog/post&#39; url will have the view &#39;views/blog/post.php&#39;, &#39;localhost/blog/&#39; -&gt; views/blog/index.php etc. This will make for a consistent organisation of the view files. What should we use as preferred javascript lib? Developer InstallationGet the code from svn make backend/logs and frontend/logs writeable make backend/cache and frontend/cache writeable create a virtual host:

<p>Project leadThis project is lead by mkjems,  mkjems@gmail.com I write this wiki and try to extract the result of the discussions in the forum. </p>

<p>Project membersThe great pople from the Kohana community who allready have expressed interest in this project are: (kohana forum names)  and in no particular order. </p>

<p>Errant, dlib, Edy, dyron, bicho44, utyf, Lick, xobb </p>

<p>Can I contribute ?Yes, indeed. This project aims to be a community effort that is open for everyone in the Kohana community who are willing to co-operate along the guidelines for cooperation (to be but into words, comming soon).   If you want to participate first, you need a google account . Second tell mkjems you google account address and you will be added to the project. Then you can start committing code through svn. </p>

<p>A little bit about the nature of this projectThis is open source and no one is getting paid. This means that work on this project have to be done after regular work and other responsibilities in peoples spare time. We all understand this, so if you express a desire to participate we understand that you have a life and that things often take longer than you initially thought. Don&#39;t worry. Hanami is very patient and appreciates all contributions, be it loose ideas and suggestions or concrete code commits. </p>

<p>Hanami will of-course not materialise without  hard core code contributions and the people who do that will  receive the bragging rights and our admiration. :) </p>

<p>Another very important thing is that you must be sure that you have the rights to the code you commit to this project and that you do it in your own time or have an agreement with your workplace beforehand. </p>

<p>Guidelines for cooperationBefore making making code changes please make post about in the Hanami category : The post should contain two thing:  </p>

<p>Describe the problem that you are trying to solve. Describe how you are going to solve it. This gives the rest of the team the chance to respond with questions and advise. How do we resolve differences in opinion? Leader has a &#39;veto&#39; right ( the last word), other contributors can advise and argument their thoughts. </p>

<p>Running &#39;svn update&#39; should not break your local version of Hanami. Hanami Upgrade policyThis should deal with how do we keep up with the konstant stream of new Kohana versions.  </p>

 title : The has-magic-columns Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HasMagicColumnsExtends ActiveRecord models and adds &quot;magic&quot; columns and attributes to a model.  Model classes or instances can maintain completely unique and separate data and are able to access this data through the standard ActiveRecord style interface. </p>

<p>This is useful in multi-user or multi-account applications where each user can &quot;customize&quot; the attributes they would like to use without managing multiple schema or installations. </p>

<p>This plugin was written by and maintained by Brandon Keene, a professional Rails developer working in San Francisco, CA. </p>

<p>InstallationYou need to create table definitions for included column and attribute models. </p>

<p>Generate the migration using the included task: </p>

<p>  rake has_magic_columns:db:createRun the standard migrate task to update your schema: </p>

<p>  rake db:migrateYou&#39;re ready to start using Has Magic Columns! </p>

<p>- Brandon Keene </p>

<p>Exampleclass Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  has_magic_columns
<br/>end</p>

<p># Create a Person
<br/>@bob = Person.create(:email =&gt; &quot;bob@example.com&quot;)</p>

<p># Add some MagicColumns
<br/>@bob.magic_columns &lt;&lt; MagicColumn.create(:name =&gt; &quot;first_name&quot;)
<br/>@bob.magic_columns &lt;&lt; MagicColumn.create(:name =&gt; &quot;last_name&quot;)
<br/>@bob.magic_columns &lt;&lt; MagicColumn.create(:name =&gt; &quot;birthday&quot;, :datatype =&gt; &quot;date&quot;)</p>

<p># Give @bob some magic...
<br/>@bob.first_name = &quot;Bob&quot;
<br/>@bob.last_name = &quot;Magic!&quot;
<br/>@bob.birthday = Date.today</p>

<p># Save @bob like normal
<br/>@bob.save</p>

<p># Find @bob and inspect him
<br/>@bob = Person.find(@bob.id)
<br/>@bob.first_name	#=&gt; &quot;Bob&quot;
<br/>@bob.last_name	#=&gt; &quot;Magic!&quot;
<br/>@bob.birthday	#=&gt; #Inherit from &quot;Template&quot; ColumnsA child can &quot;inherit&quot; magic columns from its parent.  You can use container models to provide a  column template for contained objects.  For example, an Account has_magic_columns and  has_many :people.  A Person inherits magic columns from its account: </p>

<p>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  belongs_to :account
<br/>  has_magic_columns :inherit =&gt; :account
<br/>endChildren people now all share the columns of their parent account.  You don&#39;t need to use these magic columns on the Account of course.  It&#39;s just a convenient and logical way to provide column  templating.</p>

 title : The hdr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>High Dynamic Range Tone Mapping: </p>

<p>A Proposal for Google’s Summer of Code 2007 </p>

<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) images exceed the visualization capabilities of display and print media. In order to effectively utilize the display capabilities, we need to compress the HDR image. There are different algorithms available in literature to address the color compression for HDR images. During this proposed Google Summer of Code 2007 project, I plan to write C/C++ code for established HDR tone mapping algorithms. In addition, I plan to improve upon some of the existing algorithms to create pleasing and highly natural representations of HDR image content and work on a concept to include parameters into ICC or CTL color profiles for later universal reproduction and standardization. </p>

<p>There are three main objectives for this project. </p>

<p> Improve upon some of the existing algorithms. 2. Work on a concept to include parameters into ICC or CTL color profiles for later universal reproduction and standardization. 
<br/>3. Make the state of the art HDR tone mapping algorithms readily available </p>

<p>The project is designed such that we obtain a whole spectrum of HDR tone mapping source codes for the open source community with a pleasing and easy to use GUI. I plan to avoid the duplication of efforts in cases where the inventors of the algorithms are willing to contribute the code in C/C++ under the licensing terms of our open source community. There will be a super set S of tone mapping algorithm source codes that I plan to obtain for this project. It will be composed of two mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets, namely, I and C. I refer to the subset where the code is written and tested by myself whereas C refers to the subset where the code is contributed by well known people upon invitation, which will be tested and documented by me. The members of set I shall include at least 3 of the methods described below. </p>

<p>I. Single-Scale Retinex (SSR) 
<br/>II. Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) 
<br/>III. Reinhard’s Operator 
<br/>IV. Bilateral Filter 
<br/>V. Fast Tone Mapping for High Dynamic Range Images 
<br/>The remaining methods shall form the subset C. It is expected that the proposed project will make a spectra of state of the art HDR tone mapping algorithms available under the open source scheme.</p>

What is a Hacker? - &quot;Although this term has come to refer to a &#39;computer vandal,&#39; or &#39;one who breaks, unauthorized, into other peoples&#39; computer systems&#39; in the popular media, it does not have such negative connotations in computer circles. Rather, a &#39;hacker&#39; has traditionally meant a computer programmer (not a mere user) of breathtaking technical and creative proficiency&quot; - (http://teladesign.com/ma-thesis/glossary.html).  In fact, the formal and traditional definition of &quot;hacker&quot; implies a code of  ethics and a philosophical discipline (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic). What isn&#39;t a Hacker? - The correct term for someone who attempts to break into systems illegally or maliciously is a &quot;cracker&quot;, or &quot;black hat&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat).  Real hackers would never do that, and look down on those who would.  If that&#39;s what you are interested in, then this group is not for you, you aren&#39;t be welcome, and any such behavior won&#39;t be tolerated. Why is this group called Hermosa Hackers? - Because it&#39;s a cool name, it&#39;s descriptive of our philosophy and goals, and it will be a great conversation-starter on a college application or resume!</p>

 summary : <p>HiberlyzerOpening the doors to your data. </p>

<p>What is Hiberlyzer? </p>

<p>Hiberlyzer can serve many purposes but, at its heart, it is a graphical interface and query engine for Hibernate-managed databases.  Modeled after Microsoft&#39;s SQL Query Analyzer, Hiberlyzer allows for execution of arbitrary HQL and SQL queries and browsing object metadata. </p>

<p>How can it help me? </p>

<p>Most database management systems have some software available that let you directly manipulate the data via a GUI or via executing direct SQL statements.  However if you use Hibernate to manage your object persistence you are probably more familiar with dealing with your domain model objects than the database schema used to store them.  Hiberlyzer provides the ability to perform ad hoc queries against your database using your persistent object model.  This ability provides a number of benefits: </p>

<p> Easy interface for ad hoc reporting and forensic investigation </p>

<p> Environment for developing and testing HQL queries for correctness and performance</p>

 title : The hickwall-analyzer Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The rapid expansion of internet information has made means of effective access to information become necessary, and the search engine is the one of them. Segmentation system, which is a very important part of the search engine, is primarily responsible for dividing the text into words, building index on the handled information and saving to the database. It is due to the index established on the text after segmentation, when users is using such as Baidu (www.baidu.com), Google (www.google.cn) and other search engines, they can type what they need to get the result and information quickly and easily. With no doubt that segmentation system helps us improve the speed of retrieving information and search the text needed information with more accurate and more convenient. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, segmentation system is the massive role of dividing the text (passage) into meaningful text units (item). Through the use of item as a key, passage as a value to create the reverse order index. When users type in keywords to search for information, firstly the segment system divide keyword into words, secondly find the matched key of the word in the index to get the relative information (passage) which is considered as the result of what the users need. Evidently, results of the segment system in search engine represent the massive internet information, so segmentation is a good or bad result directly affected the users searching the information they want. </p>

<p>Hickwall Analyzer discusses how to design a particular segment system for Chinese and how to implement a segmentation system based on XML document, easily extended and applied to the open source project Lucene to help the users search the information they need much faster and more accurate.  </p>

<p>Hickwall statistics on the content to form a small dictionary with high-frequence words firstly. After doing this, hickwall would cut the content into pieces base on the high-frequence dictionary and the prepared dictionary. Finally, the word pieces would be adjusted by the unlisted word analyzer. But all of these are configurable, you can change the implementation of the function easily due to Spring Framework. </p>

<p>Anyway, hickwall still has a lot of shortage. It needs your help.</p>

<p>Horovod is a Russian (slavic) word describing a particular group-based dance. It is an organized circle of people, holding each other&#39;s hands and trying to work together, synchronized to make the experience fun. The outcome of the activity - fun, complete performance - requires synergy, communication and collaboration. These are the pieces that open source projects strive upon and require. These are the functionalities horovod tries to provide in the most user-friendly package. </p>

<p>Horovod is a desktop widget designed to make it easy to share your files/clipboard through an intelligent, personal web-server/ftp-uploader/web-dav/svn/what-ever-floats-your-boat backends. </p>

<p>Horovod will guess your network configuration, will open ports on a router through uPnP and accommodate you in all possible way with one goal in mind: make it easier for you to share and collaborate with your peers. </p>

<p>Horovod will try NOT to rely on costly / cumbersome 3rd-party services, like remote http/ftp, photo sharing sites, and similar things requiring additional set up. Horovod will try to rely on a built-in webserver and svn/bzr backends, but you are certainly welcome to write a backend plugin for your favorite Web2.0 service. In order for the open source community to succeed, we need to accommodate collaborative content creators, for whom established sharing methods are a burden. Horovod will attempt to take the hustle of &#39;establishing communication&#39; out of &#39;collaboration.&#39;</p>

<p>FeaturesRESTful HTTP interface for back-end integration with other RESTful network resources Modular support for messaging protocols. Regular e-mail (via SMTP or sendmail) is available out of the box. Platform-independent, stand-alone server, installable as a Linux init.d service (it should be run on Windows as a background daemon too) Easy to configure via a single YAML file. Supports delivery callbacks that trigger further REST calls when a message is sent out to each of its recipients. InstallationInstall the gem and its dependencies:  gem install howlr 
<br/>Run Howlr for the first time to generate a sample configuration file:  howlr -c ~/howlr.yml 
<br/>Edit configuration in  ~/howlr.yml 
<br/>Run again using the edited config file:  howlr -c ~/howlr.yml 
<br/>Open up your browser and go to http://localhost:7008/messages/new to make sure it&#39;s working (your URL will be different if you changed the port and url prefix in your configuration). That&#39;s it. Your Howlr instance should now be ready to start receiving REST requests for sending out messages. </p>

<p>UsageSimple example using Ruby&#39;s ActiveResource: </p>

<p>require &#39;active_resource&#39;</p>

<p># Define the proxy class
<br/>class Message &lt; ActiveResource::Base
<br/>  self.site = &#39;http://localhost:7008&#39;
<br/>end</p>

<p>message = Message.new
<br/>message.subject = &quot;Howlr Test&quot;
<br/>message.body = &quot;This is just a test!&quot;
<br/>message.from = &quot;Test McTestski &quot;
<br/>message.recipients = &quot;John Doe ; Sally Smith &quot;
<br/>  
<br/># Saving the message commits it to the server, causing the message to 
<br/># be sent out.
<br/>message.save</p>

<p># The server temporarily stores copies of all sent messages. Saving a  
<br/># message (i.e. sending it) assigns to it a unique ID. We can use this 
<br/># ID to later retrieve a copy of this message.
<br/>message2 = Message.find(message.id) Also a look at the HowlrAPI, and the PHP Zend_Rest_Client sample code. </p>

<p>You will also probably want to configure Howlr to run as an init.d service. </p>

<p>Finally, if you&#39;re interested in other RESTful services, have a look at Taskr, a RESTful scheduler daemon.</p>

<p>httpfs your/mount/point2. read http file thru it, e.g. say http://example.com/index.html </p>

<p>cat your/mount/point/example.com/index.htmlNotesAs the name indicates this is coded in ruby, so dont expect it to be cpu efficient. This is a one day hack, published in case some people find it helpfull. </p>

<p>httpfs is coded in C so is much likely more cpu efficient, but it allows only to mount a single file per mount. It didnt fit my need. </p>

 title : The hydrant-kepler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kepler (http://www.kepler-project.org)Kepler is a desktop application or building and executing scientific workflows. A workflow in Kepler is built by selecting specialised units of computation (called Actors), and linking in their inputs and outputs to perform the desired overall task. Actors are generally simple concepts such as file reading/writing and basic mathematics but can also perform more complex tasks such as web service calls, command line execution, even grid submission. Creation of workflows is made simple by supplying a GUI with a library of available actors and a Canvas similar to conventional drawing tools. Actors are added to the workflow by simply dragging the desired actor from the library and dropping it on the canvas. Links between actors are then made by drawing lines between the actors inputs and outputs. Kepler is based on an engineering modelling tool named Ptolemy II from which it inherits the Director concept. A Director controls how the workflow is executed, i.e., what order the actors execute in, whether they block while waiting for input and much more. This ability to change the execution model is what separates Kepler from other workflow tools. Kepler is built using the Java programming language, and contains a very easy API for building custom actors, making it easy for user that have specialised requirements for their workflows to build their own actors. </p>

<p>Problems with KeplerFor someone with little technical knowledge (i.e. your average scientist), Kepler is hard. As simple as the visual interface for building workflows is, it&#39;s still not simple enough. The application is analogous to a programming IDE. It is an excellent tool for building and testing workflows, but when it comes to deploying the workflows to users, simply setting them up with a copy of Kepler and expecting them to run their workflows, which may require tweaking of the actors properties for different runs, is like expecting a user to modify a program&#39;s source code each time they want to run the program. Another problem is that, with the exception of workflows the use grid job submission actors, all workflow execution is performed on the users desktop. This is not an ideal environment for jobs that require heavy computation or long running jobs. </p>

<p>The SolutionKepler provides a great tool for building and testing workflows, so all that needs to be done is build a simple easy to use platform for deploying and executing workflows. Hydrant (which is just a codename for now) is a Web based portal which sits on top of the core Kepler engine, who&#39;s end goal is to solve this problem.  </p>

<p>Design ConceptsThe curent concept pushing the design on Hydrant is as follows:  </p>

<p>workflow “designers” build workflows for scientists using the Kepler desktop application. the designer uploads the workflow to Hydrant. from Hydrant the designer can configure specific input parameters of the workflow to be displayed to the scientists via a standard web form. the scientist logs into Hydrant, select the workflow, fill in the web form and submit a job.  The job is then executed and when complete the outputs from the workflow are made available through a web page in Hydrant. </p>

<p>StatusHydrant is still in proof-of-concept stages. </p>

<p>The basic things that have been implemented are: </p>

<p>Loading workflows with Kepler, allowing direct access to workflow properties Web view of kepler workflow Displaying and editing of actor properties Executing workflows Web form generation for job specific changes to workflow properties Capturing basic workflow output for display on the web Workflow repository searching Basic workflow sharing </p>

<p>Things that need doing in the near future: </p>

<p>Workflow validation making sure the files uploaded are valid workflow making sure all dependencies of the workflow are met More work on translating actor property types to web form view More advanced workflow sharing Notification system (alert users of finished jobs, or errors etc) User Interface enhancements much, much more.... </p>

<p>ImplementationThe proof-of-concept prototype of Hydrant has been written under jython, using django as the web framework.  </p>

<p>Jython (http://www.jython.org) was chosen for the rapid turn-around and rapid prototyping that the python language supplies, along with the jython&#39;s ability to directly access Java classes, thus allowing direct access to the Kepler engine. </p>

<p>Django (http://www.djangoproject.org) was chosen simply for exploratory reasons. it was a new web framework that seemed to have a huge potential. It has so far provided all the required functionality and is quick to develop under and easy to learn. </p>

Visualise your knowledge of thousands of items.I-gnoramus helps you learn lists of &quot;things to remember&quot;, such as vocabulary of a foreign language or your friends&#39; birthdays and calculate the state of your memory based on an empirical model of the memorisation process.  </p>

<p>Study the list, get tested on it, and visualise your knowledge. The software calculates how well you know each item at any point in time, based on a model of the  memorisation process. It helps you decide what to revise. You can also keep track of your progress and plan your studies. </p>

<p>Map your memoryA list is represented in a coloured table that can contains thousands of items. Dark green means you know the item very well, pale green means you used to know it, but it is now time for revision! You can zoom out on the table and have bird eye view of how well you know the whole list. </p>

<p>Test yourselfSelect a few items, and start a test. The test window ask you to input your answer for each item. You can input your answer as free text or as multiple choice input or a mixture of both... Each item can have more than one property. For instance, if you want to learn a list of French words, the properties could be the French word, the English translation, the gender, the plural form, a sample sentence and its translation...  </p>

<p>Learn any kind of listIt is easy to create a new list of items. You can choose what you want to be tested on and how. You can decide to be tested from English to French or from French to English for the same list. You can also create your list in Excel and import it. Or you can browse the database of existing lists online... </p>

<p>Watch yourself learnYou can see the graph of your progress from the moment you started to learn a list. You can also see you average learning speed, and your learner profile, that the software determines from your the frequency of your tests and your results. You can also see a projection of your progress in the future, depending on the effort you plan to make. </p>

<p>Plan your studiesYou have an exam with a list of items to learn? Set the date of your exam, and the software will create a study plan for you, based on your own learning speed. Your study plan can be exported to your Calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, hotmail...) and you can choose to receive e-mails that reminds you to stick to your plan. </p>

<p>All the lists of your lifeYou can create group of lists like files in a folder. A navigator view lets you navigate through all your lists. Pie charts are displayed for all the lists summarising how well you know it. You can also see pie chart for group of list and the master pie chart that represents the state of your memory of all the lists of your life... </p>

<p>Hints:Your want your list to get and stay completely dark green! Let yourself become addicted! The first time you get an item correct it will stay dark green for 3 hours If you get it consistently correct for a week, or a year, it will stay dark green for as long... If you get red or blue after a test, re-test them immediately afterwards, so that they become dark green. If you have a break in your study, go back to the list: your memory builds up even on a break and the memorisation model take this process into account.

<p>This release marks the first TWS API change since IbPy was restructured to utilize the java2python package.  The update took only a few hours, and most of that time was spent experimenting with a solution for overloaded classmethods. </p>

<p>IbPy 0.7.3-9.00 Released 11 Aug 2007This release fixes options-related code in EReader.py.  Also included is a new demo script for placing option orders and retrieving option market data. </p>

<p>IbPy 0.7.2-9.00 Released 02 Mar 2007This release fixes a missing import in EReader.py.  Also new in this release (and 0.7.1) is a conditional import and activation of the Psyco specializing compiler.  To enable, set the IBPY_PSYCO environment variable.   </p>

<p>IbPy 0.7.1-9.00 Released 22 Feb 2007Several users reported problems extracting the archive on Windows.  The problem was the use of &#39;aux&#39; as a directory name.  We&#39;ve renamed the directory, regenerated the code, and created a new release. </p>

<p>IbPy 0.7.0-9.00 Released 21 Feb 2007Read the release announcement here.  Download and documentation links are over there, on the right.  Enjoy! </p>

<p>Version NumbersThe new IbPy has new version numbers.  The new format is major.minor.micro-tws_api_version.</p>

 summary : <p>(NOTE: the ICCLE1 experiment is now over.  </p>

<p>While anyone is free to update this code, please note that new developments are now happening in a daughter code base: http://code.google.com/p/iccle2.) </p>

<p>Welcome to  Insightful Code (Common Lisp edition) </p>

<p>&quot;Too many doings, not enough learnings.&quot;When was the last time your code added  insight to your business?  </p>

<p>For example, how often do your business users interrupt the code demo to phone the CEO? </p>

<p>&quot;Wendy,&quot; they shout down the line, &quot;we have to change the western division. The programmers have just shown us a way to optimizing production by 30%.&quot;  </p>

<p>Then they storm out of the demo, spilling coffee and tipping over chairs, in their race to reorganize the business.  </p>

<p>This is a very rare event and this is our fault. We geek too much. After matching brackets for days/ weeks/ years,  all our beautiful code achieves only low-level programming goals and not the high-level business goals they are meant to serve. </p>

<p>Insightful CodeWe need more insightful code- systems that can: </p>

<p> can learn from experience.   that can reveal to business users new and exciting knowledge. </p>

<p>Current data mining methods are often not insightful since they are  focus on their internal algorithmic details, rather than their impact on  business goals. Also, some of those methods may be needlessly complex. As Janez Demsar observes: </p>

<p>In many business situations, data miners should not solve the problem. Rather, they should help people solve the problem.  And when helping people, more complex methods like neural networks and support vector machines are not as useful as, say, simple symbolic classifiers like classification trees and naive Bayesian classifier with appropriate visualizations. No  classifier can beat a good scatter plot- just show the data appropriately and let the user decipher what it tells. Forget about the fancy modeling techniques: we are the best hardware with the best software there is. Computers are only good at drawing and at searching through possible visualizations, so let&#39;s use them for that. We therefore seek a simple code library that offers new insights to the business users about their business. To do this, we combine data mining with the cognitive patterns seen at the business-level: </p>

<p>The business goals are expressed as a cognitive tasks; e.g. monitor, predict, construct, etc. This is the whole story but if contains holes : numerous details   not specified in the high level story. Data mining is used to fill in the holes; i.e. learn the details of the high-level tasks that tune it to a particular organizational context. </p>

<p>What&#39;s Different?Our library is different from standard data mining toolkits.  </p>

<p>Decades of data mining research has shown us how to build effective data miners using very simple components.  Here, we exploit that research to build simple components and show how they can service the business users&#39; cognitive tasks. </p>

<p>Insightful coding  is: </p>

<p>Model-light: the high-level cognitive tasks; And data-heavy: we assume that an organization has enough data available to tunes its business model.  And if this data is absent, we will build a high-level simulator of the business to generate the data needed for this approach.   This is different to standard business modeling practices.  Such standard modeling practices are model-heavy: many people, brainstorming complex business models.  But data-light: very little feedback from the real world to refine, maintain, and optimize those models.  </p>

<p>In standard software design, modeling is a mostly-manual early life cycle  activity with very little support for model updates.   Insightful coding, on the other hand, offers much support for model maintenance. Models are maintained from day one and are continually maintained through-out the lifecycle.</p>

<p>DescriptionInternet Explorer&#39;s implementation of web standards has never exactly been the best, and so it&#39;s often necessary to use CSS hacks to ensure that sites display consistently and correctly. </p>

<p>Internet Explorer 7 supposedly fixed many of the CSS bugs present in earlier versions; unfortuantely, whilst it has fixed some CSS issues, others remain (and new ones have been introduced). To make matters worse, several of the common CSS hacks used in IE 6 and below now no longer work - the most obvious being the star-HTML hack. </p>

<p>As such, writing workarounds for Internet Explorer has become more complex. This plugin makes a standardised approach to IE workarounds simple and consistent to implement in Rails. </p>

<p>ie_specific is an opinionated plugin, with certain workflow prerequisites, but the trade-off for this is consistency and simplicity.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutIE7.js is a JavaScript library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6. </p>

<p>StatusCurrent version: 2.1 beta3. </p>

<p>UsageIE7.jsUpgrade MSIE5.5-6 to be compatible with MSIE7. </p>

<p>IE8.jsUpgrade MSIE5.5-7 to be compatible with MSIE8. </p>

<p>You do not need to include IE7.js if you are using IE8.js </p>

<p>IE9.jsUpgrade MSIE5.5-8 to be compatible with modern browsers. </p>

<p>You do not need to include IE7/IE8.js if you are using IE9.js </p>

<p>PNGThe script only fixes images named: *-trans.png </p>

<p>If you want the fix to apply to all PNG images then set a global variable as follows: </p>

<p>var IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = &quot;.png&quot;;You must set this variable before including the IE7.js script. Alternatively, you can set the variable inside the IE7.js script element: </p>

<p>IE7_PNG_SUFFIX=&quot;.png&quot;;The suffix will ignore query string parameters. For more fine-grained control you can also set IE7_PNG_SUFFIX to a RegExp object. If you want to use an alternative PNG solution then set the suffix to something that cannot possibly match: </p>

<p>var IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = &quot;:&quot;;By default, the PNG will be stretched (this simulates tiling). If you want to turn this off then set the no-repeat property as follows: </p>

<p>div.example {
<br/>  background: url(my-trans.png) no-repeat;
<br/>}Unfortunately, the transparent background image cannot be tiled (repeated) using background-repeat. Nor can it be positioned using background-position. </p>

<p>features: </p>

<p>videos (including DVDs) and subtitles are inserted by drag and drop, you can also use CTRL + V whole folders with videos can be inserted, application will filtrate videos and subtitles from it automaticaly; if you want to rip a dvd just insert dvd drive icon or folder when the dvd is located, or any file which is in that folder (.vob,.ifo,.bup) subtitles are searched automatically if they are named same as video support for more video tracks and subtitles which are directly in video (usualy .ogm, .mkv, .avi or DVD uses this) you can insert subtitles directly to application with or before video, or by dropping it directly at the video in list of videos which waiting for conversion (the line in this list will then change color from red to green) videos are NEVER UPSIZED, only downsized or cropped if needed, so you can easily set that maximal width is 640 and insert video from youtube with resolution 320x240 and final file will have resolution 320x240, if you insert video with resolution 1280x720 then it will have finally 640x360 you can set that videos will be fitted into screen resolution, for example if your has player resolution 800x480 and you insert video with resolution 1000x750 then final video will have 640x480, if you insert video with resolution 1280x720 then final video will have 800x450, if you insert video with resolution 320x240 then final file will have 320x240(due to &quot;never upsize&quot; feature) it can monitor a folder on your computer and everytime when new video is inserted into this folder then it will automaticaly start conversion of this video (if this video is locked(for example by other application), then will wait until this video is unlocked and then start conversion)); if subtitles with the same name as a video are located in the same folder, then is used automaticaly; you can set that source videos will be automaticaly will be deleted after conversion support zoom video to fullscreen (you can set if you will see black borders on your portable player or not), also support zoom which can be set in % (you can set how much will be black borders in widescreen videos removed, but it will never crop height, only width and it will stop zooming when display aspect ratio is reached) it have TURBO button, if clicked then conversion is about 10x faster (optimized for speed, if unclicked then it is optimized for quality) it will inform you about success (or not succes) in finding of subtitles by a special nice transfluescent window that show in the midle of the screen (the great thing is that for example when you browsing internet with your browser and this window appear, then when you click on that window then the browser will not loose focus - only thing that happen is that the info window dissapear), or after conversion finish then it will show you how many subtitles wasnt found in the middle of application, and if you stop the mouse over it then it will also show for which videos werent found subtitles can be started hidden or rolled down (this is good if you want to use it as a WIDGET) videos can be rotated by 90° and black bar will be added under video, so you can watch at videos on your widescreen portable player like on iPod 5G/6G/Classic (if you holding player in &quot;portrait&quot; position then video will be on the top and black screen will be only under video) if you try to shutdown Windows while converting then application will stop this shutting down and ask you if you realy wan`t to shutdown Windows if you pause the starting of new convesions and you forget it, then aplication in five minutes will (if there is no mouse activity over application) disable this pause and start conversion (this is good for always absent-minded people like me); the window with avaiable audio/subtitles tracks or titles will also dissapear in 60 seconds automaticaly subtitles are autosizing - for example in resolution 640x480 they take 2/3 of width and in resolution 320x240 they take also 2/3 of width everything what you set in application is SAVED (this takes me a LOT of work) help is integrated directly in application, just stay with mouse for example on button, checkbox, etc. - the help window will appear - AND IT NEVER DISSAPEAR FIVE SECONDS AFTER SHOWED LIKE IN OTHER ANNOYING APPLICATIONS (disappear time is set to 100 seconds) conversion running at idle priority (it will not slow down your computer, you can do anything while converting) start of encoding and lenght of final video and all sliders CAN BE SET BY MOUSE WHEEL automatic deinterlace if the source is MPEG2 (it using Donald Graft Kernel Deiterlacer), because there is 95 % probabilty that it is from interlaced DVB or Camera (nothing happens when source isn`t interlaced, because it deinterlace only interlaced parts of movie (it is inteligent)) based on mencoder, ffmpeg, mp4box and FLVextract, NO A/V SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEMS, WITH QUALITY SET TO MAX, it using Lanczos 10 tapes luma 10 tapes chroma filter for resizing, using quantitizer instead of video bitrate, for mp3 you setting quality instead of bitrate - this mean that you will have videos always in the same quality support videos without file extension (useful when you download video from youtube without any extension, there is no need to rename in) it is OPEN SOURCE - FREE - WITH NO RESTRICTIONS SUPPORT NO RECOMPRESSION OF AUDIO, if the source is mpeg-1 layer 3, useful for videos from YOUTUBE.COM without recompression of audio - it is inteligent, automaticaly switch from &quot;no recompression&quot; to &quot;compression&quot; if soucre audio isn`t mpeg-1 layer 3 support multicore PCs (1-4 cores) using ffmpeg for muxing, and -async 192000 command (there is no A/V sync problems for Cowon D2) </p>

<p>What You Can DoOpen images in a directory sequentially Open a video, frame by frame Clip (save) and go to the next image by one button (SPACE) Move and resize your selected region by vi-like hotkeys or right mouse button Rotate and shear deform (affine transform) the rectangle region Table of ContentsDownload Application Usage Command Usage How to Compile on Linux How to Compile on Windows Creating a text file to locate clipped regions Leave comments at CommentPage  DownloadWindows binary and source codes </p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/imageclipper/downloads/list </p>

<p>Drag and Drop a folder (including pictures) or a picture or a video file on exe.  You can also execute it on the command prompt.  No installer is included for this simple software.  </p>

<p>PS. It may be required to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (if you have never installed this or Visual Studio 2005 itself). I am looking for how not to require users to install it. Not to use VC++ 2005?  </p>

<p>How to compile for Linux is written below. </p>

<p>Application Usage(Windows) Drag and drop a folder or an image file or a video file on imageclipper.exe.  </p>

<p>(Windows and Linux) Execute as a command line tool. See Command Usage section too. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mouse Usage    Left  (select)          : Select or initialize a rectangle region.
<br/>    Right (move or resize)  : Move by dragging inside the rectangle.
<br/>                            : Resize by draggin outside the rectangle.Keyboard Usage    s (save)                : Save the selected region as an image.
<br/>    f (forward)             : Forward. Show next image.
<br/>    SPACE                   : Save and Forward.
<br/>    b (backward)            : Backward. 
<br/>    q (quit) or ESC         : Quit.
<br/>    r (rotate) R (counter)  : Rotate rectangle in clockwise.
<br/>    e (expand) E (shrink)   : Expand the recntagle size.
<br/>    h (left) j (down) k (up) l (right) : Move rectangle. (vi-like keybinds)
<br/>    y (left) u (down) i (up) o (right) : Resize rectangle (Move right-bottom boundaries).
<br/>    n (left) m (down) , (up) . (right) : Shear deformation.  </p>

<p>Saved file formatThe clipped images are saved as </p>

<p>/imageclipper/_____.pngsuch as </p>

<p>../myimages/imageclipper/lena.jpg_0359_0109_0093_0065_0090.pngwhere the original filename is  </p>

<p>../myimages/lena.jpg. A directory named &quot;imageclipper&quot; is created under the image file&#39;s directory and cropped images are stored on there.  </p>

<p>This filename format can be configured via command line options. See Command Usage section. </p>

<p>Experimental Feature (Continuous Color Region)You can choose a rectangular region surrounding a continuous color region.  </p>

<p>    Middle or SHIFT + Left  : Initialize the watershed marker. Drag it.You can use Right mouse and hotkeys to move or resize the watershed marker.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Command Usage
<br/>ImageClipper - image clipping helper tool.
<br/>Command Usage: imageclipper.exe [option]... [reference]
<br/>  
<br/>     would be a directory or an image or a video filename.
<br/>    For a directory, image files in the directory will be read sequentially.
<br/>    For an image (a file having supported image type extensions listed below),
<br/>    it starts to read a directory from the specified image file.
<br/>    For a video (a file except images), the video is read.</p>

<p>  Options
<br/>    -f 
<br/>        Determine the output file path format.
<br/>        This is a syntax sugar for -i and -v.
<br/>        Format Expression)
<br/>            %d - dirname of the original
<br/>            %i - filename of the original without extension
<br/>            %e - filename extension of the original
<br/>            %x - upper-left x coord
<br/>            %y - upper-left y coord
<br/>            %w - width
<br/>            %h - height
<br/>            %r - rotation degree
<br/>            %. - shear deformation in x coord
<br/>            %, - shear deformation in y coord
<br/>            %f - frame number (for video)
<br/>        Example) ./$i_%04x_%04y_%04w_%04h.%e
<br/>            Store into software directory and use image type of the original.
<br/>    -i 
<br/>        Determine the output file path format for image inputs.
<br/>    -v 
<br/>        Determine the output file path format for a video input.
<br/>    -h
<br/>    --help
<br/>        Show this help</p>

<p>  Supported Image Types
<br/>      bmp|dib|jpeg|jpg|jpe|png|pbm|pgm|ppm|sr|ras|tiff|exr|jp2You may make a batch file (Windows) or a shell script or an alias (Linux) to setup default values. Use of -i and -v rather than -f would be useful in that case.    </p>

<p>How to Compile on LinuxYou need to install OpenCV and Boost libraries.  </p>

<p>Install OpenCVDownload OpenCV source codes (.tar.gz) </p>

<p>root user </p>

<p>tar zxvf opencv-1.0.0.tar.gz; cd opencv-1.0.0
<br/>./configure
<br/>make
<br/>make installgeneral user </p>

<p>tar zxvf opencv-1.0.0.tar.gz; cd opencv-1.0.0
<br/>./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
<br/>make
<br/>make installexport PATH=$HOME/usr/bin/:$PATH
<br/>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
<br/>export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
<br/>export MANPATH=$HOME/usr/man:$MANPATHInstall Boostroot user and Red Hat (Fedora) </p>

<p>yum install boost
<br/>yum install boost-devroot user and Debian (Ubunts) </p>

<p>apt-get install boost
<br/>apt-get install boost-devgeneral user </p>

<p>Download Boost source codes (.tar.gz) </p>

<p>tar zxvf boost_1_36_0.tar.gz; cd boost_1_36_0
<br/>./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
<br/>make installReference: Boost Getting Started on Unix Variants </p>

<p>CompileUnarchive imageclipper.zip. Go to src/ directory.  A Makefile is attached. Modify as follows: </p>

<p>If you installed boost not on $HOME/usr/: modify ~/usr/ to your path such as /usr/ If your boost version is not boost_1_36_0: modify boost-1_36 to your version.  Modify -lboost_system-gcc41-mt -lboost_filesystem-gcc41-mt to yours. Find names by $ ls /path/to/yourboost/lib. If you find names as libboost_filesystem-gcc41-mt, then =&gt; -lboost_filesystem-gcc41-mt $ make check I don&#39;t know why boost library uses different names under different system.  It requires us to modify Makefile as above in different system.... anyway, </p>

<p>Finally </p>

<p>makeYou should get an executable file &quot;imageclipper&quot;.  </p>

<p>How to Compile on WindowsA binary file for Windows is already attached.  This section explains how to compile for those who want to modify source codes and create a modified software.  </p>

<p>You need to install OpenCV and Boost libraries.  </p>

<p>Install OpenCVDownload OpenCV installer and install it. I assume you have installed onto C:\Program Files\OpenCV.  </p>

<p>Install BoostDownload boost installer and install it. I assume you have installed onto C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_35_0.  </p>

<p>Reference: Boost Getting Started on Windows </p>

<p>Setup MS Visual C++I write details based on MS Visual Studio 2005.  Change boost_1_35_0 if your version is different.  Follow menus of MS Visual C++ window as: </p>

<p>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Projects and Solutions &gt; VC++ directories &gt;  Show Directory for: &gt; Include Files. Now add C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_35_0
<br/>C:\Program Files\OpenCV\cv\include
<br/>C:\Program Files\OpenCV\cvaux\include
<br/>C:\Program Files\OpenCV\cxcore\include
<br/>C:\Program Files\OpenCV\otherlibs\highguiShow Directory for: &gt; Library Files. Now add C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_35_0\lib
<br/>C:\Program Files\OpenCV\libCompileUnarchive imageclipper.zip and open src\imageclipper.sln, then Build for Release.  </p>

<p>Creating a text file to locate clipped regionA text file containing locations of clipped region is sometimes required rather than clipped images themselves, e.g., as a ground truth text for testing experiments in computer vision. </p>

<p>Assume there exist files as follows: </p>

<p>$ \ls imageclipper/*_*_*
<br/>image.jpg_0068_0047_0089_0101.png
<br/>image.jpg_0087_0066_0090_0080.png
<br/>image.jpg_0095_0105_0033_0032.png
<br/>image.jpg_0109_0093_0065_0090.png
<br/>image.jpg_0117_0097_0052_0095.pngBy executing the following command, </p>

<p>$ find imageclipper/*_*_* -exec basename \{\} \; | perl -pe \
<br/>&#39;s/([^_]*).*_0*(\d+)_0*(\d+)_0*(\d+)_0*(\d+)\.[^.]*$/$1 $2 $3 $4 $5\n/g&#39; \
<br/>| tee clipping.txtyou can obtain a text file &quot;clipping.txt&quot; as follows: </p>

<p>image.jpg 68 47 89 101
<br/>image.jpg 87 66 90 80
<br/>image.jpg 95 105 33 32
<br/>image.jpg 109 93 65 90
<br/>image.jpg 117 97 52 95I think this file format is a typical format for testing experiments in many computer vision tools.  </p>

<p>For OpenCV haartraing UsersUse haartrainingformat.pl as </p>

<p>$ perl haartrainingformat.pl clipping.txt | tee info.datwhere clipping.txt is the text file created at the previous section to create a OpenCV haartraining suitable format such as </p>

<p>image.jpg 5 68 47 89 101 87 66 90 80 95 105 33 32 109 93 65 90 117 97 52 95Or you can generate a file without creating &quot;clipping.txt&quot; as </p>

<p>$ \ls imageclipper/*_*_* | perl haartrainingformat.pl --ls --trim --basename | tee info.datNote that clipped images themselves are enough and better for training phase (See Tutorial: OpenCV haartraining).   Therefore, you may use this only for creation of testing data.  </p>

<p>Usage </p>

<p>Helper tool to convert a specific format into a haartraining format.
<br/>Usage: perl haartrainingformat.pl [option]... [filename]
<br/>    filename
<br/>        file to be read. STDIN is also supported.
<br/>Options:
<br/>    -l

<br/>        input is an output of ls.
<br/>    -t
<br/>    --trim
<br/>        trim heading 0 of numbers like from 00xx to xx.
<br/>    -b
<br/>    --basename
<br/>        get basenames from filenames.

 summary : <p>imapfsImplements a filesystem which stores its data on an IMAP server. </p>

<p>How to dive inCheckout source from svn Set your JAVA_HOME to a version 1.5 SDK When in the root dir of the project Invoke &#39;bin/imapfsmnt&#39;   bin/imapfsmnt imap://username:password@mailserver.com/INBOX /Volumes/imapfstestStart hacking! Short tourThe application is built using a slightly modified version of fuse-j version 2.2.3. The compiled &#39;libjavafs.jnilib&#39; file is contained in subversion. </p>

<p>The application then simply invoke fuse-j to mount the filesystem, &quot;parking&quot; the thread there. Whenever the thread exists the application exits. </p>

<p>The key part is the &#39;IMAPFileSystem&#39; class which implements the fuse-j callback API, with the actual functionality of accessing an IMAP server etc. </p>

<p>The intention is that folders on the IMAP server corresponds to directories in the filesystem, and messages to files. The subject of a message contains the files name and the actual data is stored in a MIME attachement on the message. </p>

<p>Welcome contributionsUnit tests Implementing currently unsupported file operations Porting to linux (different dynamic library and probably different mount script) Nicer packaging. For instance mpkg for installing on a mac. GUI for configuring settings.

<p>AIM YIM MSN Gtalk. We will eventually expand the target protocols even further, though our focus is on these four. We can only do this with your help and on-going support! </p>

<p>Regarding the name, the project was named because of our focus on creating an AIR application, though the value of this project is more the foundational protocol libraries which we are attempting to build separately but in conjunction with the application. </p>

<p>Current StatusWe currently have completed a simple protocol for MSN and a very basic AIR client to go along with it. The next stages in that development will require adjusting the application so that the protocols work more as plug-in libraries. Basically we&#39;d like to DRY up the core code structure so that it would be easy enough to adapt future protocols. </p>

<p>For the MSN application the base functions as they are available now are: </p>

<p>Connection to MSN protocol Retrieving List of Contacts Set your display name Set your status Send Messages Receive Messages Participate in Group Chats Add/Remove Contacts  (Need some testing / bug Fixing) (Un)Block Contacts (Need some testing / bug Fixing) Some features there should implemented for future releases: </p>

<p>Logging on to MSN via SSL without the use of the webservice Start Group Chats Sort List of Contacts in Groups (contactGroups) (client should implement this) Send / Receive Display Pictures (Tried, but failed to implement) Send / Receive Files Add emoticons in Messages (client should implement this) Who Can Help?Anyone with intermediate to advanced experience in AS3 are welcomed to donate their own protocols or help adjust the core RIA application. We especially ask that individuals who&#39;ve worked on their own protocols please submit them regardless of their completion. We will look to take that code and modify it to integrate into IMonAIR. </p>

<p>We are looking for individual with a range of different talents. Here is the following list: </p>

<p>A developer who can implement the AIM protocol A developer who can implement the YIM protocol A developer who can implement the Gtalk protocol A developer who can enhance the core RIA application A developer who can enhance the GUI for the core RIA application How to Get InvolvedSimply contact one of our project owners or e-mail a request to david (at) mozzly (dot) com for more information.</p>

 summary : <p>Impala is a dynamic module framework for Java-based web applications, based on the Spring Framework. With a focus on simplicity and productivity, Impala radically transforms application development using Spring and all the usual related technologies. </p>

<p>With it&#39;s powerful dynamic reloading capability, Impala dramatically reduces build/deploy/test cycles, allowing you to spend more time coding and less time waiting for your application to reload. </p>

<p>Unlike other Spring modularity projects, Impala does not depend on any third party runtime environments. Instead, it offers offers a simple, powerful and cohesive environment for truly modular application development and deployment that just works out of the box. </p>

<p>What makes Impala different?you can dynamically reload the parts of your application that have changed you can dynamically select the parts you want to deploy you can structure your application in a modular way you can kickstart your project in a few easy steps you can still do it in Java you can use the powerful but still familiar Spring programming model you can fine tune your Spring config painlessly, even for complex apps you can free yourself from application context XML hell! you can do it all on for web apps using Spring MVC or you can use your favourite Java web framework you can develop in an interactive, TDD-friendly way you can write full integration test suites that execute in seconds, not minutes you can build your application without having to write your own build scripts you can pull your dependencies directly from a Maven repository but otherwise you don&#39;t actually need to use Maven! you can develop your application entirely within your IDE but you don&#39;t need to install any IDE plugins! News13 March 2010: Impala 1.0 RC3 released. See full release announcement.  4 January 2010: Impala 1.0 RC2 released.

See full release announcement. 12 December, 2008, Talk at Devoxx, Antwerp, Belgium. See presentation. 2 December, 2008: Talk on Impala, OSGi and class loaders at Java Web User Group, London. See presentation. 13 October, 2008: Impala 1.0M3 released. See full release announcement. 10 September, 2008: Talk on Impala at Spring User Group UK. See more details and podcast. 13 July, 2008: Impala 1.0M2 released. See issues covered in this release. OverviewImpala allows you to divide a large Spring-based application into a hierarchy of modules. These modules can be dynamically added, updated or removed. </p>

<p>Because Impala-based applications are genuinely modular, they are much easier to maintain than vanilla Spring applications. </p>

<p>Impala radically boosts productivity of Spring application development. This is enabled by the dynamic module loading capability, the seamless integration with Eclipse, and the efficient mechanisms for running Spring integration tests, both individually and within suites. When writing applications you only rarely need to restart your JVM, allowing your application changes to be reflected almost instantly. No long restart waits required! </p>

<p>Impala also features a build system, based on ANT, and dependency management capabilities, which you can optionally use. </p>

<p>For up to date news on development of Impala, see the project blog. </p>

<p>Impala is developed under the Apache Licence, Version 2. </p>

In the past, those frameworks has been applied through the environment variables, such as XMODIFIERS and GTK_IM_MODULE. and can&#39;t be influenced immediately and can&#39;t be without restarting the desktop because of its nature - it&#39;s being inherited from the parent process unless it&#39;s being brought up with the obvious thing from the terminal say.  Also, there are no such framework to bring up the necessary process at the runtime - of course anyone could runs it manually though, it&#39;s totally out of focus on this project. </p>

<p>purpose; what I hope to get done in the session apparatus and settings; so someone else could reproduce what I&#39;ve done diary; record of actions and results analysis and conclusions I use inferno for fun. the sessions I describe take place at home, in the evenings, usually Monday to Friday, 9:00pm to 11:30pm. This isn&#39;t always enough time to get things done, so some of the tasks may seem quite trivial. </p>

<p>I want labs to cover a wide range of subjects in computer science, to cross over disciplinary boundaries, to go wherever my curiosity takes me. I hope to experiment a little, learn a lot, and, just maybe, discover something new. Inferno presents a good environment to do this work, for a variety of reasons I&#39;ll explore in the labs. </p>

<p>If you like the idea join the lab.</p>

 title : The inferno-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Inferno plug-in allows a full Inferno® operating system (or any convenient subset) to run inside a web browser. </p>

<p>Coupled with Inferno&#39;s portable applications, this means that any Inferno application will run within the browser without having to modify its code.  In other words, one can write browser-side parts of applications in the concurrent programming language Limbo®, which can be fun.  You can mount and access remote resources using Styx.  No XML need be used (now, that&#39;s really fun). </p>

<p>Currently the only browser supported is Internet Explorer® version 4 and above, but we hope to change that here. </p>

<p>All the source code to the various plug-ins are in this project.  See the Inferno project page (http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os) for the Inferno system itself.</p>
 title : The inferno-spki Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A collection of C code, Limbo library modules, and Inferno file servers to allow SPKI proof sequences to be used for Inferno authentication. </p>

<p>Inferno&#39;s authentication is decentralised. Parties can have any number of public keys. The two parties to the authentication protocol present their chosen keys for the connection, each supported by a certificate provided by a common signer, usually determined by the service, and often run by the same administration.   The signer associates a user name and a public key. Not all connections to a service require the same signer. Anyone can set up a signer (but only the owner of a service can make the service use it). </p>

<p>The existing Inferno scheme is naturally decentralised but does not easily scale. To address that, we turned to the decentralised but more scalable design of SDSI/SPKI.  That will allow us to express arbitrary &quot;speaks for&quot; relations using SPKI certificates, which can then be presented to gain access to Inferno services.  Amongst other things that provides a way to define group membership in a distributed Inferno system. </p>

<p>An important sub-project is to add Inferno&#39;s authentication scheme to the set supported by Plan 9&#39;s factotum (and similarly for Plan 9 Ports). </p>

<p>This software will become part of the main Inferno distribution, but it is convenient to develop it independently in this separate area. </p>

 title : The inflection-js Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is a port of the functionality from Ruby on Rails&#39; Active Support Inflection classes into Javascript.  Instead of supporting the functionality in a new Inflector object, I&#39;ve chosen to extend the Javascript String object.  This was ported initially to support plurality in Jester (http://thoughtbot.com/projects/jester).  If anyone requires a different license in order to use this, please let me know and I can switch it over.  I intend for this to be generally available for anyone&#39;s usage, and am not intentionally limiting it. </p>

<p>Currently supported: </p>

<p>String.pluralize(plural) == String
<br/>  renders a singular English language noun into its plural form
<br/>  normal results can be overridden by passing in an alternative</p>

<p>String.singularize(singular) == String
<br/>  renders a plural English language noun into its singular form
<br/>  normal results can be overridden by passing in an alterative</p>

<p>String.camelize(lowFirstLetter) == String
<br/>  renders a lower case underscored word into camel case
<br/>  the first letter of the result will be upper case unless you pass true
<br/>  also translates &quot;/&quot; into &quot;::&quot; (underscore does the opposite)</p>

<p>String.underscore() == String
<br/>  renders a camel cased word into words seperated by underscores
<br/>  also translates &quot;::&quot; back into &quot;/&quot; (camelize does the opposite)</p>

<p>String.humanize(lowFirstLetter) == String
<br/>  renders a lower case and underscored word into human readable form
<br/>  defaults to making the first letter capitalized unless you pass true</p>

<p>String.capitalize() == String
<br/>  renders all characters to lower case and then makes the first upper</p>

<p>String.dasherize() == String
<br/>  renders all underbars and spaces as dashes</p>

<p>String.titleize() == String
<br/>  renders words into title casing (as for book titles)</p>

<p>String.demodulize() == String
<br/>  renders class names that are prepended by modules into just the class</p>

<p>String.tableize() == String
<br/>  renders camel cased singular words into their underscored plural form</p>

<p>String.classify() == String
<br/>  renders an underscored plural word into its camel cased singular form</p>

<p>String.foreign_key(dropIdUbar) == String
<br/>  renders a class name (camel cased singular noun) into a foreign key
<br/>  defaults to seperating the class from the id with an underbar unless
<br/>  you pass true</p>

<p>String.ordinalize() == String
<br/>  renders all numbers found in the string into their sequence like &quot;22nd&quot;

 summary : <p>Infra - Integrated Framework BrA idéia do Infra é fornecer um conjunto de frameworks, escritos inicialmente em Delphi, capazes de facilitar o desenvolvimento de programação puramente Orientada a Objetos. </p>

<p>Estes frameworks fornecem uma base sólida para o desenvolvimento de aplicações em delphi, levando em consideração características apenas de aplicações hoje desenvolvidas nas plataformas Java e .Net. </p>

<p>O Infra contará também com uma ferramenta de geração de código o InfraGen. O analista entrará com os modelos UML, definirá as regras de negócio, poderá configurar templates de tela e relatórios e escolherá a linguagem ou plataforma que desejar. Com base nestas informação o Infragen cuidará do resto. </p>

<p>&#39;Sonho? Acredito que não, o futuro está em nossas mãos&#39; </p>

<p>O Infra nasceu da grande dificuldade dos programadores Delphi criarem aplicações de forma completamente OO. A maioria dos frameworks do mercado só engloba algumas das camadas da aplicação, a maioria só serve para a camada de persistência. A proposta do Infra é englobar todas as camadas do sistema. </p>

 summary : <p>The purpose is to detect and localize eruptions of the active volcano El Misti near Arequipa, Peru, by infrasound measurements. Furthermore the signals are used for generation of fingerprints to characterize the geologic events. For this, microphones scattered close to the volcano are needed which collect the data time synchronized. The idea now is to install a wireless sensor web and transfer the data to a nearby station by establishing an ad-hoc network. Within this thesis I would provide the hard- and software infrastructure in special respect of power saving long time installation and quality assurance.</p>

 title : The inheritance Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Inheritance.jsInheritance.js is a plugin for the Prototype Javascript library that provides developers with a complete, unobtrusive, Ruby inspired, classical inheritance model. Using Inheritance.js, developers are given the power to easily define classes, sub-classes, and mix-ins, with a sprinkle of syntax sugar. The process of overriding methods is simplified; Inheritance.js uses a properly scoped parent method that is made available only inside an overriding method. To top it off, Inheritance.js accomplishes all this without adding any additional properties or methods to the developer&#39;s instantiated objects. </p>

<p>Introduction to iniparseiniparse is a INI parser for Python which is: </p>

<p>Compatiable with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations of ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that are API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass all the unit tests in Python-2.4.4. Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections &amp; options, indentation, comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as possible when data is updated. More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation (cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]). It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file completely rearranged whenever a program changes it.  iniparse also allows making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable in applications like image galleries. </p>

 title : The intellij-copyright-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project/Module Copyright Notice. </p>

<p>This plugin is used to ensure files in a project or module have a consistent copyright notice. Copyright notices can be created for the following file types: Java, JavaScript, JSP, JSPx, XML, HTML, xHTML, DTD, Properties, and CSS. </p>

<p>ConfigurationEnable PluginBy default the plugin is disabled for a project. Simple select the Enable Copyright Notice Plugin checkbox to enable copyright notices for this project. </p>

<p>Project and Module LevelYou can set the copyright notice at the project level first. This setting will be used as the default for each new module added to the project. You then have the option of adjusting each module&#39;s setting individually. For each module you can specify whether it has it&#39;s own custom copyright, uses the project copyright, or has no copyright at all. </p>

<p>You can also import copyright notice settings from other, external projects and modules by pressing the Import Settings button. This brings up a file chooser that lets you select project (.ipr) or module (.iml) files. Once selected the project or module is scanned for copyright plugin settings. If found they are imported into the current level. </p>

<p>At the module level you can also copy over the current project&#39;s settings by pressing the Copy Project Settings button. </p>

<p>SettingsAt a given level (project or module) you can define a copyright notice template to be used by all supported file types and/or you can tailor the copyright notice settings for a specific file type. </p>

<p>TemplateTextMost likely you will want the same general copyright notice for all file types. This is done by setting up the template. The copyright notice template should be undecorated and language independent. In other words, the template should not contain any language specific comment markers. </p>

<p>The template will be treated as a Velocity template. See the section below for more information on Velocity templates. </p>

<p>Formatting OptionsOnce the basic text of the copyright notice is set you can specify several formatting options. </p>

<p>First you should specify whether the copyright should be entered using a file&#39;s block or line comment syntax. A language not containing the selected choice will use the syntax it does have available to best emulate the choice. If the block comment is chosen you have the option of having each line preceded by a comment marker. </p>

<p>Second you can specify whether the comment should be surrounded by a line of comment markers, referred to as a separator. If both separators are selected and are of the same length you will have the option of having the whole comment &quot;boxed&quot; in. The character used to fill the separator can specified. By default (nothing specified) the character used will be appropriate for the given language. Tilde (~) is used for XML type languages because a hypen (-) isn&#39;t valid when strung together. </p>

<p>Relative LocationIf the area containing the copyright notice contains other, non-copyright comments you can specify whether the copyright notice comes before or after the other comments. </p>

<p>You may also specify that you want a blank line to appear after the copyright notice. </p>

<p>Copyright KeywordThis keyword must be a valid Java regular expression (see java.util.regex.Pattern) used to determine if a comment is a normal comment or a copyright notice comment. It is important that the keyword expression doesn&#39;t match non-copyright notice comments or you may find comments getting deleted that you didn&#39;t want deleted. This warning is only true for comments near the beginning of files within the areas that copyright notices may appear. Comments in other parts of a file will not be effected even if the keyword expression matches. </p>

<p>PreviewChecking the Preview checkbox allows you to see what your comment will look like using Java comment syntax. This is your entered text formatted with all the options chosen in the Formatting Options area. </p>

<p>ValidatePressing this button verifies that the text is a valid Velocity template. If the Velocity engine finds any problem with the text an error message is displayed. This does not verify whether the resulting comment is valid for the given file type. </p>

<p>File TypesBy default all supported file types will use the template copyright notice. You do have the option of changing the settings for a specific file type. </p>

<p>Template OverrideNo Copyright - Select this if you don&#39;t want any copyright notice added to files of this type. If a copyright notice exists it will be removed. Use Template - Use the template copyright notice. Use Template Text - Select this if you want to use the text of the template copyright notice but you wish to format the text differently. Fully Custom - Select this if you need to enter a copyright notice in a form not supported by the supplied formatting options. If you choose this option then the text you enter must be a complete and valid comment for the given file type. See the section below on multi-comment notices. </p>

<p>Formatting OptionsThis is only enabled if Use Template Text has been selected. The options work just as described under the Template section. The only exception is that the Block and Line comment choices are enabled based on the features of the language. </p>

<p>Alternate Comment SyntaxJSP files can use either JSP comments or XML comments. By default the JSP syntax is used. To use XML you must check the Use XML Comments checkbox. </p>

<p>Relative LocationThis is enabled if Use Template Text or Fully Custom has been selected. The options work just as described under the Template section. </p>

<p>File LocationThis specifies where within a file the copyright notice is to be placed. </p>

<p>JavaThe copyright notice can be placed in one of the following locations: </p>

<p>At the start of the file before the &quot;package&quot; statement. Between the package statement and any imports. Between the imports and the first top level class (before the class&#39; Javadoc comment, if present). XML/DTD/HTML/xHTML/JSP/JSPxThe copyright notice can be placed in one of the following locations: </p>

<p>Before the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; specification. Before the first tag of the document. All Other File TypesFor all other file types the copyright notice must appear in the begining of the file before any non-comment, non-whitespace content. </p>

<p> Multi-Comment Notices and Blank Lines </p>

<p>A copyright notice may contain multiple comments. This is a given when using line comments and the copyright notice contains more than one line of text. You can also have muliple block comments in a single copyright notice. This can only happen when using a Fully Custom copyright notice. A Fully Custom copyright notice also allows for any combination of line and block comments to be used. </p>

<p>There is one very important consideration though when your copyright notice contains multiple comments - there can&#39;t be any blank lines between any of the comments. Note - this doesn&#39;t mean there can&#39;t be blank lines in the copyright notice. They just need to be within a block comment. </p>

<p>If you have a Fully Custom copyright notice with multiple comments and you place blank lines between any of them, you will most likely get undesirable effects when you perform copyright updates on files of that type. </p>

<p>MenusThe option to update the copyright notice will appear in the following locations: </p>

<p>At the end of the context menu for a supported file in the project tree. At the end of the context menu for a supported file in the packages tree. At the end of the context menu for a supported file in an editor. At the end of the context menu for a directory in the project tree. At the end of the context menu for a package in the packages tree. At the end of the context menu for a module in the packages tree. At the end of the context menu for a module in the project tree. At the end of the Code menu if the current editor contains a supported file. At the end of the Generate popup menu if the current editor contains a supported file. Selecting a file or directory in the project tree works just like Optimize Imports. You will have the option of updating a single file or the whole directory. </p>

<p>New files will automatically have the correct copyright notice applied to them if the file is a supported type and the file type has copyright notices enabled. </p>

<p>Copyright TemplateThe contents of the copyright notice can be plain text or a Velocity template. See http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity for more information on Velocity and see http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/user-guide.html for more details on writing Velocity templates. </p>

<p>Currently the following variables are available in the Velocity context: </p>

<p>Name  Type  Comment   $today  DateInfo  Represents the current date and time   $file.fileName  String  The current file&#39;s name   $file.pathName  String  The current file&#39;s complete path and name   $file.className  String  The current java file&#39;s classname   $file.qualifiedClassName  String  The current java file&#39;s fully qualified name   $file.lastModified  DataInfo  The date and time the file was last changed   $project.name  String  The current project&#39;s name   $module.name  String  The current module&#39;s name   $username  String  The user&#39;s name  </p>

<p>DateInfo has the following properties: </p>

<p>Name  Type  Comment   year  int  The date&#39;s year   month  int  The date&#39;s month (1 - 12)   day  int  The date&#39;s day of month (1 - 31)   hour  int  The date&#39;s hour (0 - 11)   hour24  int  The date&#39;s hour (0 - 23)   minute  int  The date&#39;s minute of the hour (0 - 59)   second  int  The date&#39;s second of the minute (0 - 59)  </p>

 summary : <p>Stream Utilities (EasyStream)Small set of utilities for dealing with streams. You can use this library for: </p>

<p>&#39;Convert&#39; an OutputStream into an InputStream. Stream statistics gathering: bytes read/written, bit rate. Stream buffering: read the content of an InputStream multiple times or seek to a definite position. Stream wiring: While reading the data from an InputStream &quot;tee&quot; it to supplied OutputStream(s) or write data to multiple OutputStream(s) at the same time. EasyStream is a natural extension of Apache commons-io, providing advanced solutions to some common but not trivial problem. Focus is on performance and memory usage.  </p>

<p>Format detection (WazFormat)This library is a format identification framework that integrates a native format identification engine with droid and in future will integrate mime-utils and apache tika. </p>

<p>Supports more than 60 file formats. on the fly detection: it wraps the original InputStream so it&#39;s able to &quot;preserve&quot; the data in it for further processing (the data is eventually buffered to disk or to memory but the users won&#39;t notice it). Nested detection: it can detect what is inside a bzip2 stream or a PKCS#7 document. Result of identification is an Enum. Most of identification libraries return a string that must be further parsed by the calling software.

<p>psmxyorg. </p>

<p>SDK Update: I got some time with an apple SDK engineer (rare opportunity). I was very excited about porting Ants to the SDK, and thought I&#39;d use the opportunity to write version 2.0. Unfortunately, Apple has put a number of restrictions on apps written using the SDK, and the background-nature of Ants violates a couple of those restrictions. So, I will be looking into ways to get around them, and if anybody has ideas, feel free to punt them my way.  </p>

<p>NOTE: It seems as though the BSD Subsystem package is necessary for ants to run. I&#39;m still investigating as to why. It could be just the existence of /usr/lib/libarmfp.dylib, which BSD subsystem installs. </p>

<p>NewsSept 10, 2007: Ants 1.2.0 is out. This&#39;ll be the final release before 2.0 (probably). Features include a couple bug fixes, addition of the spawn rate adjuster in the controller app (requested many times). Let me know if there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like to see (besides more bugs - that&#39;s already in the plan). You can already start mucking with the details of bugs in /usr/local/share/ants/bugs.plist. Just make a backup.  AboutInteractive &quot;game&quot; which involves ants crawling around on your screen. Based on the principles of A-Life, they react to what you do. Kill them, shake them off, scare them. </p>

<p>FeaturesWhile you use your phone, ants will appear on screen. You can squish them, among other things. Ants react to nearby death - they get scared. Tilt the phone and shake and they might let go and fall off... or slide around on the screen if the phone is upside down.

 summary : <p>We deal with anything wireless on the iPhone: 802.11, GSM, and Bluetooth. </p>

<p>StumblerStumbler lets you view the wireless networks in your area. While right now Stumbler only handles 802.11 networks, soon you should see Bluetooth and GSM capabilities as well. </p>

<p>Stumbler is still in a early Alpha stage, but it is fully functional, and pretty stable.  </p>

<p>Planned Features </p>

<p>Auto Scanning Manufacturer detection Logging A-GPS Raw 802.11 packet capture (monitor mode) </p>

<p>MobileApple80211MobileApple80211 is a framework roughly analogous to the Apple80211.framework (private) on &quot;big&quot; Mac OS X. </p>

<p>Most of the effort is currently going into working out how the various functions available work, but eventually we plan on pulling the statically linked code out of the existing apps that use it, and making it into a more direct library, without using the dynamic linker. </p>

<p>At first glance, the library appears to be a highly object-oriented version of the mainstream Apple80211 framework. It uses CoreFoundation objects wherever one might expect them, instead of structs and so on. Given that the Apple80211 framework is a private framework, it might possibly be an indication of Apple intending to revise the mainstream framework in Leopard. </p>

<p>For a list of the currently known functions, please see Apple80211Functions.  </p>

<p>And yes, we&#39;re open to suggestions of better names. Submit an issue or contact us in #iphone-80211 on irc.osx86.hu.</p>

 summary : <p>Availabile Now on the AppStore:BookShelf v1.0 - In order to reduce confusion with the OpenSource version, my rewrite of Books has been renamed to BookShelf, and it&#39;s available now for $9.99 on the AppStore.  I hope you&#39;ll agree that the small fee is a worthy price for the improvements in BookShelf.  The full list of features and improvements is available on http://www.iphonebookshelf.com, but to name a few: </p>

<p>BookShelf loads huge files in seconds.  I&#39;ve tested up to 7.6MB with no problems. Support for FB2 (FictionBook) files, including images.  Also, images in Plucker files. Much improved performance - opening a multi-megabyte file for the first time takes 5-6 seconds.  Subsequent opens are faster once the file is indexed. BookShelf has taken several months of hard development work.  I hope you&#39;ll give it a try! </p>

<p>-Zachary Bedell </p>

<p>(Not to be confused with Zach Brewster-Geisz, the original author of Books.app who has my sincere thanks for creating Books, and also for tolerating my shameless plug of BookShelf here.) </p>

<p>(And for the record, having two guys named Zachary on one project?  Yeah, that&#39;s confusing....) </p>

<p>What is Books?Books.app is a simple eBook reader for the iPhone.  It reads HTML and text files stored in your ~/Media/EBooks folder, and is smart enough to enter subdirectories, if for instance, you&#39;ve broken a book down by chapters. </p>

<p>First time using Books.app?You&#39;ll want to learn: </p>

<p>How to install it (grab it from Installer!) How to get eBooks onto your phone (SCP or iPhuck) Visit KnownIssues or Books Tech Support if you have a problem Visit TODO to find out what&#39;s coming next </p>

<p>Getting HelpIf you have problems using Books, especially after upgrading your iPhone or iPod firmware version, please visit the Books Tech Support Google group.  Please only post issues in the Issue tab if you have a genuine reproducible bug. </p>

<p>(More shots below) </p>

<p>FutureEventually, this project will include a simple method of syncing eBooks to your iPhone.  At the moment, that&#39;s handled by iPHUC and a shell script called copybookdir.sh.  As of v. 0.4.2, this script is a separate download. </p>

<p>Getting ContentBooks.app is recommended for use with Project Gutenberg texts, in conjunction with GutenMark, a fantastic PG markup tool by Ronald Burkey, which makes pretty HTML out of Gutenberg .txt files, and splits them by chapter using a second tool.  I have, for the hell of it, included a copy of Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which you can download here and expand into your Media/EBooks directory on your iPhone, so you can easily judge the reading experience.  Unlike the earlier copy of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (which is still available in the Downloads section), this directory and its files will work with copybookdir.sh. </p>

<p>Another option is manybooks.net, where you can download HTML-ized Gutenberg and other Creative-Commons licensed texts.  The site&#39;s maintainer has created a preset for download that will work well with Books.app (thanks, Matt!).  Select a book and choose the &quot;iPhone Books.app&quot; option. </p>

<p>Thanks!Books.app stands on the shoulders of giants, most notably iphonenes, mobileterminal, and Erica Sadun&#39;s first &quot;word processor.&quot; </p>

<p>Books.app was created by Zach Brewster-Geisz who can be reached at zach AT brewstergeisz (dot) cjb DOT net.  Primary coders include Zach Brewster-Geisz, Chris Born, Zachary Bedell, and BCC, with contributions from Stephan White and suggestions from all over the Webernets.  If you have patches or feature suggestions, please send them to the Books Tech Support Google group.  Bug fixes are quite welcome and will be committed to SVN with our sincere thanks! </p>

<p>Books.app is not at all related to the book organization software of the same name, which I didn&#39;t even know existed until recently! </p>

 summary : <p>This is the temporary home of the iPhone Elite development team&#39;s work.  It was created after Zibri commandeered the first Elite wiki when he was booted from the combined teams. </p>

<p>No contributionsOne of the founding principles of Elite from day one was &quot;we don&#39;t accept money&quot; (you can see that founding quote still below in the original &quot;About us&quot; paragraph).  It was about fun, not profit.   Zibri is now actively seeking contributions and uses sponsored ads on his blog.  That&#39;s how far he&#39;s fallen from the Elite team ideals.  (That, and publishing/selling an illegal IMEI changer). </p>

<p>A NOTE ON THE LEAKED JERRYSIMZibri&#39;s unauthorized release of the Jerrysim code has effectively killed this exploit (actually, this entire class of exploits).  The code leak pointed Apple exactly to what needs to be fixed, and now it will be fixed before the kinks of Jerrysim can be worked out.  So it was a wreckless leak with no practical purpose other than to derail the efforts of a team he was no longer welcome on.  The community lost an exploit for no reason other than personal spite. </p>

<p>A NOTE ON THE LEAKED ANYSIM 1.1.3Zibri basically just leaked it and changed the credits to his own name.  That&#39;s it.  Gray did all of the work, Zibri was not involved at all.  If he had done anything for it, I would be fair and say that he had, but he didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s no different than if any person from outside the dev team got ahold of a beta copy, and did the same.  He can talk all he wants about the &#39;crazy ones, misfits, etc.&#39; but all he did was just steal something from someone (Gray), claim it as his own, and release it before it was ready because he was pissed off for being voted out of the team. </p>

<p>There are thousands upon thousands of people that will download and use that piece of software without ever giving so much as  an iota of thought to how hard this one, individual person worked to make this happen for you all free of charge.  So for those of you who say &#39;bravo for releasing&#39; to Zibri, please be aware that you&#39;re also saying &#39;screw you&#39; to Gray, the guy who actually did all the work. </p>

<p>OTHER NEWSThis page is more of a repository for what was the former &#39;iphone-elite&#39; team.  All of this info will be migrating to a new site that is the result of the union of the former &#39;iphone-elite&#39; and &#39;dev team&#39;. </p>

<p>About us: We don&#39;t like secrecy, we don&#39;t take ourselves too seriously, and we&#39;re not out to make money. If you want to help, you can keep us company on IRC (we stay up very late) or send us iPhones (working or not) for testing. Monetary contributions are not accepted. If you have money you want to donate, please donate it to a good charity. </p>

<p>The &quot;iPhone Elite&quot; name started out as a joke when the iPhone Dev Team forked due to some personality issues. Fortunately, these issues are now long past us and the Dev Team and Elite Team are now reunited and working together cooperatively. </p>

<p>2008/08/27 UpdateVersion 1.0.1 now available.  </p>

<p>2008/08/12 UpdateFrotz is now available on the iTunes App Store! </p>

<p>Nostalgic for a simpler time? </p>

<p>Then take advantage of those crisp high-resolution fonts to relive the glory days of the Great Underground Empire, or play any of hundreds of great works from the Interactive Fiction archive. </p>

<p>2008/08/06 UpdateWell, it took a little longer than I expected, but Frotz has received a major overhaul and the new official version now suports ZBlorb files (with display of artwork), has an integrated web portal to IFDB and other Interaction Fiction resources, and lots of bug fixes and interface polish.  Frotz has been submitted to the App Store and hopefully will be available soon. </p>

<p>New Screenshots     </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t have any definitive answer about the SDK NDA, I&#39;ll make the source available here as soon as I can. </p>

<p>2008/06/11 UpdateI have Frotz working under the iPhone SDK and will be putting it on the App Store for free next week after I work out some issues with how to get game files onto the phone.  I&#39;ll putting the source up here as soon as I can verify for sure that the iPhone SDK NDA has definitely expired.  (There seems to be some confusion on the point.  If anyone has a link to a definitive answer, let me know.) </p>

<p>A good starting point for exploring the wealth of Interactive Fiction is availale at the  Interactive Fiction Archive. </p>

<p>I recommend using the Search option to find games for the Z-Code platform that have a 4- or 5-star rating, or looking at the top entries for the annual Interactive Fiction contest.   </p>

<p>Please note that only games written for the Z-Code platform are supported by Frotz, including all original Infocom games except the ones with graphics.   (Frotz does not yet support games with graphics, which can be identified in the IF Archive as Z-Code version 6). </p>

 summary : <p>Mastermind game for  iPhone. It should work with any web browsers with JavaScript on. But I wrote it mainly for iPhone, so I&#39;ll use the  word iPhone instead of browser. </p>

<p>The game is written using  Google Web Toolkit (GWT). </p>

<p>To play, just point your iPhone to http://muquit.com/iphonemm/ </p>

<p>If possible, please download iphonemmx.xx_web.zip and host it in your own web server instead. </p>

<p>Screenshots  </p>

<p>RulesYour iPhone creates a code with 4 colors randomly picked from 6 colors (first row). The number of colors can repeat. Your goal is to find the code. Start by guessing 4 colors.  Score will be given with black and/or white pegs.  A black peg indicates a color is correct and it is also at the right position. A white peg indicates a color is correct but it is at the wrong position. The scoring pegs do not indicate the order of the guessed colors. DownloadThe game is nothing but a sophisticated JavaScript. If you want to host it to your web server, download iphonemmx.xx_web.zip and unzip it inside document root. The directory iphonemm will be created. Access the URL http://your_server/iphonemm/ from your iPhone. </p>

<p>If you want the source, download iPhoneMMx.xx.zip or the latest development code can be obtained via Subversion. I personally use svn (on Linux), Subclipse (with eclipse) and TortoiseSVN (Windows). </p>

<p> svn checkout http://iphonemm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/iPhoneMM/If you&#39;re wondering how the code looks like, have a look at iPhoneMM.java. </p>

<p>Summary:This is a python script with Pyobjc support 、makes you easily changing offline map on your iPhone without Wifi connection. </p>

<p>On iPhone 1.1.X , there is a applications call iLM, which do the same thing as OfflineMaps does. Since 2.0.X release , iLM can&#39;t work on my iPhone , so I made OfflineMaps to solve my problem. I hope it can help you ,too. </p>

<p>Having maps offline allow your iPhone/iTouch to display maps to find your path. Thanks to the &quot;current place&quot; feature made by apple, you could be localized on a map even if you don&#39;t have GPS hardware. This might be done by taking some localization data on Wifi spot. </p>

<p>Please put the map directory into /var/mobile/Media/Maps the map folder should include the following files: </p>

<p>MapTiles.sqlitedb com.apple.Maps.plist </p>

<p>And now , you can also restore your route data. </p>

<p>You can make your route on the iPhone (which will be placed  at /var/mobile/Library/Maps/Route.plist), and using import function to import Route into Route list. Just like importing the Map. </p>

<p>An easy way to make your offlinemapsIn v1.2.4, we make a new function , called import Maps , which can let users import their Map Cache downloaded by Maps. You can make a new map either using GMDL or using Maps with the import function. </p>

<p> press the Edit button at top-right of the screen.  
<br/> press the import or the green plus to use the import function.  
<br/> entering the name you wanna name your Map, and press import.  wait for a minute, and you will see your new Map in the Maps list. :) </p>

 summary : <p>This application allows you to read large Text (.txt,.text), eReader/Peanut Press (.pdb), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Palm Doc (.pdb), Mobipocket (.pdb,.prc,.mobi), Plucker (.pdb), HTML (.htm,.html), CHM (.chm), and Fiction Book (.fb2) files quickly and efficiently on the iPhone/Touch.  This application doesn&#39;t have the fancy formatting of  ruBooks or Books.app, but it supports many formats and can quickly load and display large text files that currently cause problems with some UI Text View/Web View based apps.  It also gives you some options to reformat/reflow text so that it might be more readable on the iPhone&#39;s smaller screen.  If you want to load books quickly and read text, this may be the app for you. </p>

<p>OS 3.0 - Not WorkingNOTE: textReader uses APIs that have been removed from iPhone OS 3.0 I just ordered a mac Mini and I&#39;ll see what I can do to fix things once it arrives. </p>

<p>Sorry for the trouble, -Jim </p>

<p>2.1 for OS 2.0This is pretty close to where version 1.1 was for OS 1.1.4 but not quite as pretty. </p>

<p>Font Zoom isn&#39;t going to happen until the App Store or a better SDK, so I have disabled it. CHM support is currently broken so I have disabled it. To install, copy contents of zip file to /Applications using scp, &quot;Disk Aid&quot; or your favorite file transfer method Remember to set eXecute permissions using ssh or terminal &quot;chmod a+x /Applications/textReader.app/textReader&quot; then &quot;chmod a+x /Applications/textReader.app/unrar&quot; If you have problems with textReader exiting/disappearing, try the following from the command line: &quot;ldid -S /Applications/textReader.app/textReader&quot; Let me know of problems in issues ... </p>

<p>Version 1.1 for OS 1.1.4Adds support for CHM, ZIP and RAR files.  These files will be expanded into cache directories so you can navigate into them and open the files they contain.  Cache directories can also be deleted. Improved formatting for eReader, Mobipocket, RTF, Palm Doc, Plucker, HTML, FB2, PDB, PRC, and Text files. Adds an option to automatically delete cache directories when you leave them Adds an option for &quot;File Scrolling&quot;: Swipe leftright to go to the next or previous file in the directory. Better file management including improved file ordering and updating after a delete Added an indicator to differentiate between opened and unopened files Split up the settings page into sub-pages New search options Minor bug fixes Previous Change Logs: http://code.google.com/p/iphonetextreader/wiki/ChangeLog </p>

<p>Alternate Icons </p>

<p>You can download the icon pack, copy the icon you like to /Applications/textReader.app/icon.png, and then restart your iPhone/Touch to use the new icon. </p>

<p>A Cry For HelpSeveral people have asked about a user&#39;s manual.  I only have a limited amount of time to work on this, so I wind up spending it coding.  If someone wants to take a first whack at a manual/instructions/FAQ/whatever I&#39;ll be happy to edit it a bit and put it up for others to use. </p>

<p>Using textReader:To hide/display the menu bar and slider, tap in the middle of the screen. Select Open on the menu bar to get a list of files.

If the file is not in the first encoding, the second will be tried, then the third, then the fourth.  Note that many encodings overlap so you may need to order the encodings carefully if you have files with multiple encodings. &quot;Show Cover Art&quot; will display a .png or .jpg image with the same name as the file, or cover.png or cover.jpg in the same directory as the file. Smooth Scroll will enable the classic iPhone &quot;sliding scroll&quot; &quot;Align text - Word Justify&quot; will add space between words to make the text align with the left and right margins. &quot;Align text - Character Justify&quot; will add space between characters to make the text align with the left and right margins.  Suitable for many Asian languages. &quot;Strip Line Feeds - Single&quot; will remove single carriage return/line feed characters.  This can improve the appearance of text that has been formatted for a wider display with hard line breaks. &quot;Strip Line Feeds - Format&quot; tries to be a bit more creative - it will a carriage return/line feed unless it is  followed by a &#39;-&#39;, a single or double quote, or a tab  after a &#39;.&#39;, &#39;:&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, or a single or double quote (ignoring any intervening blanks)  Select &quot;lock&quot; icon to toggle automatic screen rotation changes on or off.

<p>Installing:Now on Installer thanks to Big Boss! 
<br/>Open Installer, go to Productivity, and then scroll down to textReader. Or - download the latest version in the Downloads section.  Make sure you set the eXecute bits on /Applications/textReader.app/textReader and the /Applications/textReader.app/images directory (if using version 1.0 or later) Adding eBooksThe default directory for textReader is /var/mobile/Media/textReader, but it remembers where the last opened file was so you can navigate to any directory you want. (The directory will be created when you run textReader) I recommend installing OpenSSH on your iPhone and using WinSCP for Windows to install files.  Mac users can use Dropcopy, which should work even better. Or, you can always just use scp from a Unix command line ... Note: Version 1.1 and above suppports opening zip files in place. </p>

<p>Download eBooks via SafariIf you install the Safari Download Plugin from http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=1136 you can click on Palm Doc .pdb and Mobipocket .prc files and download them directly to your iPhone.  They will be downloaded to /var/root/Downloads, so you can navigate to that directory or make a symbolic link to it in /var/mobile/Media/textReader. I recommend the books from http://manybooks.net and http://www.baen.com as a starting point.  This should also allow you to download zip files containing supported eBooks as well. </p>

<p>Download via URLYou can also use the download page to download a file. </p>

<p>Tap in the middle of the screen and select Open Select Download File via URL Enter a URL to download from    ex:    URL: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15772/15772-8.txt Enter a name for the Download:    ex:    Save As: The Prince - Machiavelli Select Download File Now - file will be placed in /var/mobile/Media/textReader See http://manybooks.net/site_news/2008/05/03/new-iphone-app-textreader/ for a way to use Download with Manybooks.net </p>

<p>Palm Doc .pdb and .prc SupporttextReader can open most Palm Doc, eReader, Plucker, and Mobipocket unencrypted non-DRM files (i.e. generally purchased files are protected in some way and can not be read).  It will display them as plain text - no links, contents, pictures, etc.  Plucker books will work, but links will not work so it may be of limited use for Plucker fanatics.  It can read the books off of Project Gutenberg just fine and will display all of the book rather than just part of it. Formats like Isilo and Tome Raider will not work.  Some of these formats are proprietary or DRM&#39;d which means I won&#39;t be able to open them.  If you want support for one of the other formats, let me know the details and I&#39;ll see what I can do.  </p>

<p>PDB/PRC File ReduxSome folks are having problems opening .pdb files.  PDB/PRC files are kind of like AVI files - a container than can hold things in various formats.  If you have a PDB/PRC file and it isn&#39;t in Palm Doc, eReader, Plucker, or Mobipocket format there probably isn&#39;t much I can do.  Formats like iSilo are not public, so textReader can&#39;t read them.   If you buy an encrypted PDB/PRC file, textReader probably can&#39;t read it either ... sorry, but it isn&#39;t my fault - blame the company you bought the book from (although they probably didn&#39;t have much choice either).  Note that some companies like www.baen.com sell unencrypted Mobipocket books that should work fine.  Others sell &quot;multi-format&quot; books that include Palm Doc - these should work as well. Let me take this moment to suggest that you use a good old plain text file.  It&#39;s fast, portable, easy, future-proof, and as long as the encoding is supported it will simply work and everyone will be happier! </p>

<p>File EncodingsFile Encoding changes take effect after the file is opened.  textReader will try to open the file with each encoding specified on the Settings page in order - if the encodings are not correct you&#39;ll get an error and the previous file will remain open.  Of course, many encodings overlap so you may also get a page of garbage characters.  Certain types of files (HTML, RTF, etc.) get preprocessed in order to display properly.  A cache file will be created at the first open for these files so that they can be reopened.  Since cache files are Unicode, they will always open properly (assuming they were initially opened properly) even if you change the encoding later on.  There is also a &quot;Cache All Files&quot; option that will create a cache file for everything you open - even if no proprocessing was needed.  This can help you avoid encoding issues if you use files with many incompatible encodings. </p>

<p>Future enhancements:Add way to scroll between files in a directory with swipes (1.1Beta1) Add support for CHM/LIT files (Note: Loading non-DRM Text only) (CHM in 1.1Beta1) Support zip files (i.e. treat like a directory) (1.1Beta1) Make file list use smaller font and/or be multi-line so the full title can be seen. Bookmarks - if interested, add suggestions in the Issues section Hyphenate word breaks (need to figure out better word break rules) Improve download - allow textReader to get a list of files for you to select from Provide better control of line spacing Allow the &quot;default&quot; directory to be set Provide option to change inter-character spacing (this will probably be slow ...) Provide option for custom margin sizes Improve scrolling smoothness, especially up/backwards Improve load speed (especially for HTML, FB2 and Plucker) Add support for Word/Doc and PDF files (Note: Loading the Text only) Add UMD support (may need to wait for OS 2.0) Add support for other formats (request formats in Issues) Improve formatting - possiby retain simple things like bold, underline, and italic chapter/index support (create automatic bookmarks for chapters?) Add visual cue for previously opened books password support Suggest more enhancements in the Issues section ContactYou can email comments, requests, questions, etc. to iphonetextreader at gmail.com.

 title : The iphotor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Overviewiphotor is a web application that let users can drag and drop the photos to select tags, and can edit in place the tags. The project was powed by Ruby on Rails 2 and jquery. </p>

<p>UI Draft</p>
 summary : <p>iPhreak (aka WozBox) can be used to play DTMF telephone tones. These tones can be used for both legit and not-so-legit purposes. I advise against any unethical use of this software because you most likely will only achieve getting yourself in trouble.  </p>

<p>This project was mostly started as a demo. The idea of having a clone of the Blue Boxes that were sold by Steve Wozniak to fund the Apple I to would be AT&amp;T phone phreakers, would complete the circle by having it on the Apple iPhone, partnered with AT&amp;T. </p>

<p>WARNNGDo not play these tones into a land line phone receiver if you value your freedom! Maybe that&#39;s an over statement, but still, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. </p>

<p>ProgressThe app currently looks like the screen shot below. It is capable of DTMF tones in operator &quot;Blue Box&quot; and standard carrier &quot;Silver Box&quot; flavors. It also has &quot;Red Box&quot; coin insertion tones. The &quot;Blue Box&quot; is skinned after Steve Wozniaks&#39; blue box design. </p>

<p>TODOUpdate for iPhone 2.0 - In progress Add about box Implement preferences Localize Red Box (pay phone change tones) Add tone queuing with option to disable Fix intermittent stuttering audio Create LCD or figure out TPLCDTextView if possible Fix play/pause length timer. May need to pre-render samples Maybe add scrolling view optional to the ButtonBar setup Build ButtonBar dynamically ButtonBarView class needs to be changed as well Add localization support to KeyPad class      </p>

<p>To BuildDownload with SVN using the instructions on the Source page. On your build machine, copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the iPhone (this sets up non-username login) scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@iphone:~/.ssh/authorized_keys Change the permissions on the iPhone like so: chmod 755 /var/root
<br/>chmod 700 /var/root/.ssh
<br/>chmod 644 /var/root/.ssh/authorized_keysUncomment and change IPHONE_IP in the Makefile, or set an env variable of the same name. For automatic springboard restart, please install Erica Sadun&#39;s iPhone tools. DisclaimerPhone phreaking is illegal in probably most parts of the world that I know of. In fact, in the US there aren&#39;t any systems left that respond to 2600 Hz. Don&#39;t attempt to actually use these on a live phone circuit, except the Silver Box. If you do something stupid it&#39;s not my problem. You&#39;ve been warned. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering why I made this app then, it&#39;s for nostalgia and practice honestly. Oh, and the irony. I never phreaked a phone system before in my life so I don&#39;t even know if this app would even work. I&#39;ll only test the Silver Box function bcs that may actually be useful for something. Maybe an analog dial plugin for AddressBook. </p>

 summary : <p>La simulación de sistemas es de vital importancia en el mundo actual, casi en cualquier área de desarrollo humano se encuentran paquetes de software especializados en emular sistemas reales, para que estos  puedan ser analizados e investigados, sin necesidad de interactuar directamente con el sistema real. </p>

<p>El presente trabajo de grado proyecta realizar el diseño de un software de simulación de redes LAN con tecnología Ethernet, para ser usado  por estudiantes del área de comunicaciones de la carrera de Ingeniería Electrónica. La característica mas especial del simulados es ser un sistema multiusuario,  donde varios computadores interconectados por internet o por un Router, podrán compartir el mismo entorno de simulación de modo que los estudiantes pueda interactuar entre ellos analizando y aprendiendo de los aspectos más importantes de una red de datos Ethernet. </p>

<p>Este software funcionara de forma didáctica de modo que el aprendizaje de la gran mayoría de las características que describen a una red de datos sea clara y entendible de forma rápida y sencilla.  </p>

<p>En el mercado existen diferentes paquetes de simulación para el análisis de redes, cuyas características no se acomodan en su totalidad a nuestras necesidades  además estos no son enfocados directamente al ámbito académico. Con del desarrollo del presente proyecto de grado se solucionará las deficiencias encontradas en estos paquetes, por lo que el software a desarrollar estará orientado  principalmente con un contexto académico, el cual pueda ser utilizado libremente por los estudiantes de la Universidad Javeriana. </p>

<p>Lo que busca este proyecto es una aproximación a un escenario de red, en donde se encuentren dispositivos generalmente usados en una red LAN Ethernet y que permita la libre interconexión entre ellos, dando al usuario la libertad de recurrir a este material en cualquier momento y realizar experimentos con diferentes diseños de configuraciones de una red. </p>

<p>Es importante resaltar que gracias al aporte de otros estudiantes y personas interesadas en la actualización del simulador, se lograría que el simulador que inicialmente tendrá funciones básicas, en un futuro pueda acercarse muy detalladamente a un escenario real incluyendo diferentes dispositivos y protocolos.</p>

<p>Ideas for improvements: </p>

<p>make the tx work at 192khz sampling rate /  improve AGC behaviour /  improve the mic processor for SSB /  the processing sample rate is 12khz. But 8khz would be better, the hilbert filter and audio   fir performance improves at low sampling rates. The audio FIR filters were designed with a open source program named FIRDsgn.exe, the hilbert filter with http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/mkfilter/hilbert.html </p>

 title : The ironrhino Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IronRhino is a web application skeleton to help develop Web applications quickly and efficiently. </p>

<p>at server side,it built on springframework,struts2,hibernate,spring security(acegi) and cas,sitemesh,compass,jboss rules(drools),activemq etc.it supports auto CRUD by just add simple annotation on domain model class. </p>

<p>at browser side,it use jquery,jquery ui and jquery plugins ,it support ajax history,ajax form,ajax link,sortable table,tree view etc by just add some css class on elements. </p>

<p>IronRhino是一个骨架,可以帮助高级开发者快速web应用程序. </p>

<p>为什么采用ironrhino </p>

<p>在服务器端,核心是spring容器,web框架采用struts2,数据持久层采用hibernate,web访问在 spring security(acegi)的保护之下,集成了cas作为中央认证管理器,用sitemesh装饰页面不,compass作为搜索引擎,jboss rules(drools)作为规则引擎,activemq作为jms代理. </p>

<p>亮点: </p>

<p>1.支持自动配置CRUD </p>

<p>2.可以在运行期动态增加或删除实体类的动态属性而不用重启. </p>

<p>3.spring security的配置文件也可以在运行期动态更改不需要重启. </p>

<p>浏览器端,采用jquery作为核心. </p>

<p>亮点: </p>

<p>1.表单链接只需要增加class就能自动ajax方式提交,表单的提交在浏览器端有简单的校验,在服务器端 action里面struts2校验的结果会以json返回有错误会提示表单和链接都可以根据class的设置返回成json或者html,返回的html不是html片段,所以服务器端的action,jsp不需要考虑请求是否是ajax.浏览器端会从返回的html里面读取数据做局部刷新.ajax的链接支持浏览器的前进后退.在浏览器不支持js的情况下,会自动退化成普通方式提交.总体来说,增加的ajax支持不需要页面和服务器端做额外的工作. </p>

<p>2.为html element增加class可以完成一些效果,比如拖放,树形结构,二级菜单等 </p>

<p>3.兼容各种主流浏览器. </p>

 title : The irsim-mode Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IRSIM is a switch-level simulator for digital logic circuits. This is an Emacs mode for editing IRSIM netlists. It provides syntax highlighting and an extremely pleasant method if indentation, as well as some minor polish that you should enjoy but not notice. </p>

<p>To install, put irsim-mode.el somewhere that emacs will see it like your site-lisp/ sirectory and stick something like this in your .emacs file: </p>

<p>(autoload &#39;irsim-mode &quot;irsim-mode&quot; nil t)
<br/>(setq auto-mode-alist
<br/>      (cons &#39;(&quot;\\.sim$&quot; . irsim-mode) auto-mode-alist))Note that this will override the default behavior for opening .sim files, which is to go into simula-mode. This might be a problem if you use both. </p>

<p>This mode is opinionated. It has a very specific idea of how IRSIM code ought to be indented, and if you don&#39;t like it then just set irsim-use-fancy-indent to nil. I think that the default indentation method leads to very pretty files and easy typing, but YMMV.</p>

<br/> </p>

<p>What we areConcept project which will create a web interface that makes it possible to play or record a game of Go on the iPhone. Current stable release (based on phpGo) needs to be modified to use the guidelines posted here: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/designingcontent.html </p>

<p>Current stable release is built using PHP, MySQL, Javascript, XHTML, and CSS. </p>

<p>You can think of iShudan as both the server behind the webapp, as well as the webapp itself. The open and downloadable source code is server-side only, since we run the webserver, PHP environment, and MySQL on a remote server somewhere, similar to many other well known applications. We make the wiki and the code available here for anyone to add to, modify, or examine.If you like our project and would like to have a local &quot;dojo&quot; of your own, you can do so provided you have the necessary requirements. </p>

<p>Additions to the original functionality are also overdue as well, such as Pass, Request Take Back, Single player game record mode, etc. Import and export via SGF.  chat box and email reminders already implemented by benjam post-phpgo. Atomantic is a seasoned web developer and David Whitlock is a seasoned network/computer geek who is obsessed with the game Go.  </p>

We are starting from an existing code base and modifying it to suit a related but different application, thus the project fork and name change.  At the moment, we are gathering interested individuals who happen to find themselves free to contribute some time in any capacity to our endeavor, and this can include coders of any kind, testers, documentation assistance, graphics or web design, anything at all.  We don&#39;t expect this to be a large project, just a helpful microcosm of the Open Source world.  We will agree on a roadmap and work towards goals as a group to release a software package that other people may find useful and improve in kind.   </p>

<p>A note from DavidPlease feel free to take a look at my blog http://intellectualpirate.com/blog, where I will track this project and updates to it, and comment or just say hey.  There is also a good wiki being developed, so if you want to jump in then just make a comment on one of the pages and let us know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Go professional, just like I&#39;m not a coder, just an interested amateur in all of the above topics.  You can even start a game if you like just to take my mind off whatever I&#39;m being paid to do during the day normally. </p>

<p>A note from atomanticI&#39;m a Go novice but I&#39;ve wanted to try making a good Go game for a long time. Actually since before David got me into it. At some point, I would like to add an AI feature to iShudan and finally scratch my AI itch. Further reading on the difficulties inherit in this idea here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Go and http://www.aihorizon.com/essays/goai/intro.htm . However, iShudan is at this time not intended to be an AI machine, keep that in mind. I intend to add the Ext Javascript Library (http://www.extjs.com) as a backend to this project so we can rock out some tight object oriented JS code. Digg it. In general we hang on irc.min3.net in #go </p>

<p>How to helpDownload the code to inspect it or improve it if you can, or make a comment of support on the wiki.  Help us determine what changes make sense for our project and its goal of mobility for Go.  iShudan in a nutshell: An internet portal for the game of Go which provides portable access anywhere that the Internet is available; the target application is well suited to demonstrate the utility of a touchscreen/mobile friendly target such as a smartphone or iPhone-like device. If you are a Web Developer and have experience with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, XHTML, and/or CSS we would be happy to add you to our team. If you do not have web developer experience but you love Go and you want to give some user interface, testing, design, feedback, we will also be happy to have you on board. (no pun intended) </p>

 summary : <p>ItadakiOriginal website. OpenOffice.org extension for the Japanese language. I only provide the unchanged extension compiled from latest sources in the SVN repository. If you want to play games with furigana I recommend my new add-on for Firefox: Furigana Inserter. </p>

<p>Furigana InserterFurigana Inserter is an add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox. It automatically inserts furigana for words written in kanji. Furigana are small characters written in kana which appear above words in kanji. </p>

<p>Furigana Inserter uses MeCab: Yet Another Part-of-Speech and Morphological Analyzer to translate kanji to kana. </p>

<p>Furigana Inserter includes the ability to monitor the clipboard for a change. When a change is detected it inserts the text in the clipboard into the browser page and inserts furigana in it. </p>

<p>Furigana Inserter can also look up words in a dictionary and display a translation in a popup menu. The Rikaichan add-on is required for this to work. </p>

<p>Furigana Inserter is licensed under the GPL. Source code is included in the extension. Source code for MeCab is available from MeCab&#39;s home page. </p>

<p>RequirementsWindows OS. Currently Furigana Inserter only works on the Windows OS. I have only tested it on Windows XP SP3. Mozilla Firefox. Requires version 3.0 or higher. HTML Ruby add-on for Firefox. Furigana Inserter requires the HTML Ruby add-on in order to display furigana above kanji words. Version 4.43 or higher recommended. If you use Firefox 3.5 then I recommend downloading a fixed version from this site. Also see FAQ#Why_does_it_take_so_long_for_furigana_to_appear?. Furigana Inserter requires a dictionary in order to work. See FAQ#How_do_I_install_the_dictionary_for_Furigana_Inserter? for installation information. Recommended SoftwareRikaichan is a Japanese-English dictionary add-on for Firefox. It is required if you want Furigana Inserter to look up words in the dictionary and to display a translation in a popup menu. JWPCE is a good free Japanese Word Processor for Windows. It has a lot of useful features for students of the Japanese language. AGTH is a program for capturing text from running programs. You can use to copy the text from Japanese computer games into the clipboard. You can contact me at zorkzero@hotmail.com .</p>

<p>关于技能云作为软件开发者，我们从一个又一个的项目中得到了什么？除了学到新的知识、得到应有的薪酬与职位，我们还积累了良好的声望：我们生产有用的软件，我们又快又好地完成工作，我们用自己的专业技能为客户创造了巨大的价值。作为一个软件开发者，我们无时无刻不在为此骄傲。 </p>

<p>但声望给我们带来了多少利益？还有谁记得你几年前完成的那些“不可能的任务”？还有谁记得你通宵加班为项目做出的贡献？还有谁记得客户和领导曾给你的赞扬？我们的声望还没来得及给我们带来回报，就匆匆地销声匿迹了。 </p>

<p>我们的声望被严重低估了。 </p>

<p>我们创建“技能云”就是为了重建软件开发者的声望。我们希望记录下自己辛勤工作的成果，并与他人分享我们的骄傲。我们希望让别人知道我们掌握什么技能、参与过什么项目、帮助过什么客户、做出过什么贡献。我们希望让自己、让同事、让朋友、让所有关注我们的人有机会了解：我们是多么优秀的软件开发者。 在“技能云”里，你可以： </p>

<p># 记录自己参与过的项目;
<br/># 找到自己参与过的项目;
<br/># 告诉别人，你在项目中做了什么;
<br/># 记录自己掌握的技能;
<br/># 在自己的Blog上展现自己的技能云图;
<br/># 找到和自己具有同样技能的朋友;
<br/># 快速生成自己的简历＊;
<br/>（＊即将推出）技能云的来源最初产生这个念头的透明，是《软件工艺》一书的译者。 在这本书里，作者Pete McBreen指出：声望（reputation）是软件开发者在工作中积累的重要财富。 衡量软件开发者的标准，不是僵化死板的认证考试，而是他们在一个个项目中积累的声望。 基于声望的评判体系，正是对工艺学优良传统的传承。 </p>

<p>但事实上，除了极少数“明星项目”和开源项目之外，软件开发者们在大部分项目里积累的声望并没有给自己带来足够的帮助。 帮助同行们建立声望，让声望带来价值，这就是创建“技能云”的原动力。 </p>

<p>幸运的是，透明在这个时候遇到了1sters!团队。一个点子，加上一支具备强大技术能力、行动力和丰富Web 2.0经验的团队，再加上Ruby on Rails的魔法，“技能云”就这样成为现实了。</p>

 summary : <p>This project is being left up for reference but is no longer being actively maintained.</p>
 summary : <p>iTunesRails 0.8.1This open source project provides a web interface to the iTunes application running on the same machine. iTunesRails allows people sharing a work space and local computer network to control a common iTunes instance and shared music collection. It can also be used for events and parties. The mission of iTunesRails is to help make music-playing in common spaces more social and collaborative. </p>

<p>While the computer running iTunesRails must be running Mac OS X 10.5, anyone on the local network can queue songs on iTunesRails as long as they have a computer with a web browser.  </p>

<p>This project was cooked up by Daniel Choi and Mackenzie Cowell to use in Betahouse, a coworking space for web developers in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Colin Nederkoorn subsequently joined the project to help design the user interface and feature set. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>RequirementsOS X Leopard (10.5) is required because iTunesRails uses the Cocoa Scripting Bridge and the Leopard version of RubyCocoa. The project was also built using the Ruby on Rails framework, which comes preinstalled with Leopard. </p>

<p>How To Download and RunTo download the program, open a Terminal and cd to any directory where you want to keep the itunes-rails program. Then type this command to retrieve the code: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://itunes-rails.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ itunes-railsOnce the code is checked out from the code repository, type </p>

<p>cd itunes-railsand then </p>

<p>mongrel_rails startThis should start itunes-rails. Open a web browser to the URL </p>

<p>http://localhost:3000 You should see the itunes-rails web interface. </p>

<p>To let other people on your local network access the same interface, make sure you turn on Web Sharing in the Sharing System Preferences panel. People should be able to hit itunes-rails using your computer&#39;s website address as indicated by the Sharing Preferences panel, with &quot;:3000&quot; appended to it. </p>

<p>iTunesRails is still evolving. To get the latest features and bugfixes, cd into your itunes-rails directory and type </p>

<p>svn upThis should update the code. Then stop the mongrel_rails process (with Control-C) if you haven&#39;t already and restart it with &quot;mongrel_rails start&quot;. </p>

<p>To let other people easily drop in audio files and have them automatically added to the iTunes library running behind iTunesRails, you can set up a shared folder with the appropriate Automator folder actions. A more detailed guide on this is forthcoming. </p>

<p>Feel free to report any problems or feature suggestions via the Issues tab above. </p>

<p>Enjoy music, enjoy life. </p>

<p>Planned Features and Improvementsintegration with LastFM user accounts packaging the whole application as a standard Apple OS X app (but still with the web interface), so that it&#39;s easy for non-programmers to download, install, launch, and update make the application automatically attempt to fetch missing album artwork over the web if it&#39;s not currently available in the local iTunes library    </p>

<p>Release Notes  </p>

<p>Version 0.0 (March 25, 2008)Mackenzie Cowell and Dan Choi come up with the idea for this project. Mac volunteers to turn his spare Mac Mini into a betahouse iTunes music server. Dan starts studying the Cocoa Scripting Bridge and gets ready to code the project. </p>

<p>Version 0.1 (April 2, 2008)The maiden release. We have some ideas about future features, e.g. Ajax, but suggestions are appreciated. </p>

<p>Version 0.2 (April 3, 2008)Added album cover art, plus Ajax interaction to minimize unnecessary page refreshes. </p>

<p>Version 0.3 (April 3, 2008)Stability improvements. Added artist list left sidebar for easier navigation. </p>

<p>Version 0.4 (April 5, 2008)Added the ability to batch-add tracks to the queue. Miscellaneous bugfixes and CSS improvements. Now using JQuery in addition to the Prototype javascript library. </p>

<p>Version 0.5 (April 5, 2008)Added automatic periodical updating of the currently playing song. Minor layout improvements. </p>

<p>Version 0.6 (April 8, 2008)Added the ability reorder upcoming tracks in the queue. Re-implemented batch queuing to use (slightly) more efficient makeObjectsPerformSelector:withObject method. </p>

<p>Version 0.7 (April 8, 2008)Major improvements in reliability of pause/play, skip, and previous track. </p>

<p>Version 0.8 (April 11, 2008)Much faster batch queueing of tracks. </p>

<p>Version 0.8.1 (April 12, 2008)Faster sorting of tracks by column.</p>
 title : The itunes-rails Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Background infoAs a long time iTunes user, I rated most of my music so that the songs I like can be found quickly or played more often. I still use iTunes at work, but I recently switched to Linux, so that means no iTunes for me. </p>

<p>As my library is rather large, I decided to write a script to import my ratings from iTunes into Amarok, my new music player of choice. </p>

<p>itunes2amarok currently imports ratings and play counts. It does not import your music into Amarok, it only applies ratings you have set in iTunes to your music library in Amarok. </p>

<p>Installation howto Make sure all your music is already in the collection in Amarok.  Download the file above  Open Amarok and select Plugins from the menu.  Choose Install new script  Select the newly downloaded file – iTunesRatings.amarokscript.tar.gz  Run the newly installed script (in the “General” category)  Find and select your iTunes Library XML File – should be named “iTunes Music Library.xml”  Depending on the size of your library, get a cup of your favorite beverage  If your library is really big, why not go for lunch? Known issues </p>

<p>Some people report problems with accented characters. If you encounter such problems, please send me a mail so I can fix it. If you can, send me a file where this happens. Central European characters work well and I don’t have many songs with other international characters. The script needs kdialog to run correctly. If you installed Amarok without installing KDE, please also install kdebase. In any case, should you encounter problems with the script, let me know.</p>

 title : The itunesu-api-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>iTunesU Web Services API for JavaIntroductionThe iTunesU Web Services API for Java is an interface to the iTunesU Web Services API written in the Java programming language. This API allows software developers to write applications that integrate with iTunesU to automate the creation and management of courses and multimedia documents for the iTunesU system. </p>

<p>The iTunesU Web Services API provides services for the management of iTunesU courses using an XML interface. This Java API provides the necessary tools to use these XML-based services using native Java classes. In doing so, it alleviates the need for application developers to be concerned with XML manipulation or networking details. </p>

<p>Getting StartedUse of this API requires Java 5 or newer. </p>

<p>Downloading LibrariesDownload the itunesu-api-java-(version).jar file from the Downloads section and add its path to your CLASSPATH. </p>

<p>Importing ClassesAll of the classes are in the edu.asu.itunesu package, which you can import with the following statement: </p>

<p>    import edu.asu.itunesu.*;Creating ConnectionsThe ITunesUConnection class is the main interface to this API. You will need a few pieces of information, which you should have received when you registered as an iTunesU API user: </p>

<p>    String siteURL = &quot;https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/example.edu&quot;;
<br/>    String debugSuffix = &quot;/abc123&quot;;
<br/>    String sharedSecret = &quot;STRINGOFTHIRTYTWOLETTERSORDIGITS&quot;;
<br/>    String[] credentials = {&quot;Administrator@urn:mace:itunesu.com:sites:example.edu&quot;};With these variables defined, you can create a connection: </p>

<p>    ITunesUConnection conn =
<br/>        new ITunesUConnection(siteURL, debugSuffix, sharedSecret, credentials);Optionally, you can set the identity: </p>

<p>    conn.setIdentity(displayName, emailAddress, username, userIdentifier);Or, using a string of your construction: </p>

<p>    conn.setIdentity(identity);Retrieving InformationYou can start by retrieving the entire Site: </p>

<p>    Site site = conn.getSite();A Site contains Sections: </p>

<p>    List sections = site.getSections();Each Section contains a mix of Divisions and Courses, which share a common interface called SectionItem. You can use the instanceof operator to determine which of the two you are dealing with: </p>

<p>    for (Iterator i = sections.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
<br/>        Section section = (Section) i.next();
<br/>        System.out.println(&quot;Found a Section: &quot; + section);</p>

<p>        for (Iterator j = section.getSectionItems().iterator(); j.hasNext();) {
<br/>            SectionItem item = (SectionItem) j.next();</p>

<p>            if (item instanceof Division) {
<br/>                Division division = (Division) item;
<br/>                System.out.println(&quot;Found a Division: &quot; + division);
<br/>            } else if (item instanceof Course) {
<br/>                Course course = (Course) item;
<br/>                System.out.println(&quot;Found a Course: &quot; + course);
<br/>            }
<br/>        }</p>

<p>        System.out.println();
<br/>    }Divisions contain more Sections, which in turn can contain Divisions and Courses, forming a tree. </p>

<p>If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can grab a course out of the tree by indexes: </p>

<p>    Section section = (Section) sections.get(6);
<br/>    Division division = (Division) section.getSectionItems().get(0);
<br/>    Section subSection = (Section) division.getSections().get(0);
<br/>    Course course = (Course) subSection.getSectionItems().get(0);Each Course contains Groups, which appear in iTunesU as tabs: </p>

<p>    for (Iterator i = course.getGroups().iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
<br/>        Group group = (Group) i.next();
<br/>        System.out.println(&quot;Found a Group: &quot; + group);
<br/>    }Each Group contains Tracks, which represent the individual media objects: </p>

<p>    Group group = (Group) course.getGroups().get(0);
<br/>    for (Iterator i = group.getTracks().iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
<br/>        Track track = (Track) i.next();
<br/>        System.out.println(&quot;Found a Track: &quot; + track);
<br/>    }Updating InformationYou can update a Course, Group, or Track by using the merge methods. To use these methods, construct a new object containing only the data you want to update. For instance, to rename a Group, do the following: </p>

<p>    Group groupUpdates = new Group();
<br/>    groupUpdates.setName(&quot;Test Tab 1&quot;);
<br/>    conn.mergeGroup(group.getHandle(), groupUpdates);Reloading ObjectsAfter performing a merge operation, the data has been updated on Apple&#39;s servers, but the Group object still contains the old data. To refresh the Group object: </p>

<p>    group = conn.getGroup(group.getHandle());
<br/>    System.out.println(group.getName()); // Should print &quot;Test Tab 1&quot;.There are corresponding getCourse(), getTrack() and getSite() methods. There is also a getSiteMinimal() method, which retrieves only the Name and Handle attributes of each object. It is a good idea to use getSiteMinimal() if you are dealing with a large tree, as it will load much faster. You can then use the other get-methods to load details for the specific objects you are interested in. </p>

<p>Creating New ObjectsThe process of adding new objects to the tree is similar to the process of updating existing ones: create an object, set some properties, and call the appropriate method on the connection: </p>

<p>    Course course = new Course();
<br/>    course.setName(&quot;Test Course&quot;);
<br/>    course.setShortName(&quot;Test&quot;);
<br/>    conn.addCourse(section.getHandle(), courseTemplate.getHandle(), course);The handle of a newly-created object can be retrieved from the ITunesUResponse object: </p>

<p>    ITunesUResponse resp = conn.addCourse(...);
<br/>    System.out.println(&quot;New course handle: &quot; + resp.getAddedObjectHandle());Copying and Moving ObjectsObjects can be copied by using them as templates in the add methods. For instance, to copy a course, use addCourse and pass the source course&#39;s handle as the course template handle:  </p>

<p>    Site site = conn.getSite();
<br/>    Course srcCourse = ...; // find the source course in the site tree
<br/>    Section destSection = ...; // find the destination section
<br/>    Course destCourse = new Course();
<br/>    // if you want to make any changes as you copy, call setters on destCourse here...
<br/>    ITunesUResponse resp = conn.addCourse(destSection.getHandle(), srcCourse.getHandle(), destCourse);To &quot;move&quot;, delete the source object after you copy: </p>

 title : The ivyroundup Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to Ivy RoundUpIvy RoundUp is an online Ivy repository meant to be shared by all Ivy users. </p>

<p>Instead of hosting Ivy module definition files (ivy.xml files) and artifacts together on the same site, this site hosts only the module definition files plus additional meta-data (packager.xml files) that describes how to download and extract the module&#39;s artifacts on-demand at the point of use. </p>

<p>This new type of repository is made possible by the Packager Resolver, a new Ivy resolver in available Ivy 2.0 that supports downloading, extracting and repackaging artifacts on-demand. </p>

<p>The Packager Resolver allows for a clearer separation between two jobs which don&#39;t necessarily go together: maintaining Ivy meta-data, and hosting the actual artifacts. The focus of the Ivy RoundUp project is the first task. </p>

<p>In addition, it&#39;s easy to use the Ivy RoundUp repository&#39;s meta-data to build a normal repository containing artifacts. </p>

<p>Our goals are: </p>

<p>To maintain an Ivy repository that is: Comprehensive: containing all of your favorite stuff Up-to-date: rapid inclusion of newly released software Refined: full use of Ivy&#39;s powerful configuration definitions and dependency mappings Self-consistent: consistency in naming with respect to organizations, modules, configurations, and dependencies, according to documented standards and guidelines To facilitate the easy creation of a normal Ivy repository based on the Ivy RoundUp meta-data To grow an active community of maintainers (want to help?) each of whom is motivated by their own personal interest in, and daily use of, the modules they maintain To become the premiere community Ivy repository on the Internet </p>

<p>Want to try it out? Install the latest version of Ivy and then configure your ivysettings.xml as described here. </p>

<p>Interested in learning more? Join us on the Ivy RoundUp mailing list! Or read how you can help and become a contributor. </p>

<p>You can also view the modules contained in Ivy RoundUp so far.</p>
 summary : <p>IvySvn is a resolver for Ivy 2.0 which uses Subversion for storing artifacts for use in Ivy&#39;s publish and retrieve operations. Ivy is a dependency manager for Java which can be integrated into Ant builds to allow for retrieval of artifacts (e.g. third-party jar files) which your project may depend on as well as publication of artifacts (e.g. your own .jar/.war/.ear/.tgz files etc.) that your build generates. Subversion is not supported &quot;out of the box&quot; by Ivy itself, which is the gap that IvySvn aims to fill.</p>

 summary : <p>The Elite Suite is our suite for Intraweb and VCL for the Web that includes components from our legacy component packs packaged into one single and simple install.  </p>

<p>The suite includes the following components:  </p>

<p>Visual ComponentsDialogs - including MessageBox, Login, Progress, Search Relace, Print, Confirmation, Session Timeout Popup Region - Using this component, it is possible to show a customized dialog to the end user that is somewhat &quot;modal&quot;. The dialog shows above other components on your form and can be customized as you wish for notifications or for accepting user input. Enhanced Edits - Adds a label and other style settings to the built-in Intraweb visual components. Miscellaneous Visual Controls - Check/Radio Listbox, Draggable Tool Window, ImageURLs File Upload - Provides file upload capability for page mode forms Region Grid - Region that duplicates it&#39;s content for each row in a dataset. File Grid - A grid that implements a file listing for server-side files. It supports uploads, downloads, folder management and folder security. String Grid - A very flexible grid component that can be used as a simple string grid or, while combined with one of our content providers, can be easily transformed into a powerful and editable data aware grid. PayPal - buttons to integrate paypal payments and shopping carts with your application. Non-Visual ComponentsGrid Content Providers - Components that turn the String Grid into a data aware grid, a treeview, ini file editor or a calendar. Interop - Components that allow Intraweb&#39;s App Mode and Page Mode to interoperate (Mixed Mode) and to allow one Intraweb Application to communicate with another (AppDriver Mode). This adds a HUGE amount of potential power to your Intraweb application.</p>

<p>MixedMode interop adds a WebModule to your ServerController allowing your app to respond with custom HTML/XML/SOAP and PageMode forms. Session Helpers allow you to (almost) transparently pass session information between AppMode and the web module. This allows you to post data from an external source such as a PDF file back to your application. Also, you can use IW page mode to create interactive popup windows for list selection or data entry and integrate that data back to the user session.  AppDriver interop can use one IntraWeb Application (App or Page Mode) to &quot;drive&quot; any number of IntraWeb applications. One application can now execute any function that exists in a separate IntraWeb application. This can be useful for navigating through forms, executing processes or simply showing application or user information. All this happens inside of the current user session. No additional sessions are created so that no unnecessary overhead is needed. Translation - Components to help the internationalization of your Intraweb applications. Language can be manually changed at runtime, or automatically set based on the user&#39;s browser settings. PageController - A component wrapping some common javascript tricks such as limiting right clicks and to ensure that your application is the top level window. ServerManager - The Elite Suite includes the professional level activation of ServerManager StyleManager - Provides a simple way to group visual components in &quot;styles&quot; which can be loaded at runtime via an INI file. Provides a great way of skinning your applications Template Processor - A vastly enhanced template processor that provides altering control properties from within the template and creating new intraweb components from within the template. Server Side Timer - This implements a threaded timer that runs server-side. It&#39;s a great and easy way to launch time consuming processes.</p>

<p>class java.util.Observable  interface java.util.Observer  Note that the check for hasChanged when notifying is skipped and notification of the observers will happen anyway. This way, it&#39;s not longer needed to call setChanged() on the observable before calling notifyObservers().

 title : The j2mvc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>For developers that hate J2EE, JSP, Java Faces or Tapestry. J2mvc let&#39;s you code fast and deliver better web applications. </p>

<p>No XML, minimal configuration, play everywhere implementation. </p>

<p>This is still in early development stages. </p>

<p>IntroductionJmvc is a lightweight web framework built on java. It is based on the View-Model-Controller pattern and currently supports only MySQL. Jmvc was created as a substitute to all those complicated, inflexible frameworks that are currently in fashion in the Java world. </p>

<p>DetailsJmvc was inspired by Code Igniter, a lightweight, small, powerful PHP framework and Django, the python web framework. If you have done development in any of those frameworks and you understand a bit of Java then you&#39;ll be at home with jmvc. </p>

<p>Why use it? </p>

<p>Jmvc was designed to help you concentrate on coding for your application and not for your framework. No configuration, no XML, no nothing. Get in and start coding. Jmvc helps you separate concerns. Application logic, data retrieval and design are done in totally separate places in your code. That means you have no jdbc statements in you logic or code in your html. Repetitive tasks like pagination, session management, jdbc handling are simplified by built-in libraries. No J2EE, no beans, no java weirdness whatsoever. Your code will be short and to the point. Just plain old java. Extensive database abstraction layer. Jmvc supports both Active Record &amp; Query sets. If you want to retrieve a blog post from the database you only need to write post.load(post_id). It&#39;s extensible. You can write your own libraries either on top of those provided or roll your own. It&#39;s open, no fees, no charges &amp; you can take peek at the code.</p>

 title : The jambase4rails Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JamBase4Rails is a Ruby on Rails plugin that provides a simple mechanism for searching for live music using the JamBase API. </p>

<p>To install: </p>

<p>svn: script/plugin install http://jambase4rails.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/jambase4Rails </p>

<p>git: script/plugin install git://github.com/mattapayne/jambase4rails.git </p>

<p>Configuration: </p>

<p>JamBase4Rails requires that the JamBase API key be specified in your environment file (ie: development.rb, test.rb or production.rb). It can be configured like the example below. </p>

<p>JamBase4Rails.configure dp |settings|
<br/>  settings.api_key = &quot;sdfdfffdfsdfffsdf&quot;
<br/>  settings.fake_calls = false (optional - if true, this will cause the plugin to return static data)
<br/>endExamples: (Also the see example app at: http://jambase4rails.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/JamBase4RailsExample) </p>

<p>#The hash of arguments is optional in all cases</p>

<p>@events = JamBase4Rails::API.search_by_artist(“A Band”, {:zip =&gt; “90210”, :radius =&gt; 50})</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>@events = JamBase4Rails::API.search_by_zipcode(“90210”, {:artist =&gt; “A Band”})</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>@events = JamBase4Rails::API.search({:artist =&gt; “Something”, :zip =&gt; “90210”, :radius =&gt; 20})</p>

<p>View Helpers:</p>

<p>&lt;%= jambase_text_attribution(text=nil, link_options={}, span_options={}) %&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;%= jambase_image_attribution(image_options={}, link_options={}) %&gt;</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>&lt;%= jambase_favicon(image_options={}) %&gt;The return value of all calls is an instance of the class Events. This is basically an array with an additional property called title the holds the search results title (if any). As a result, you can simple iterate over the collection of events contained in the result set. </p>

<p>Currently these are the only search options available, however, my understanding in talking briefly with the folks at JamBase is that there will be more soon. I will attempt to keep this plugin uptodate. </p>

 title : The java-macros Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An enhancement to the JDK7 compiler (the GPL&#39;d version) that adds support for compile-time macros.  Macros are Java classes that are instantiated and executed at compile-time.  The macros take in a source file&#39;s parse tree and a &quot;ParserFactory&quot; that can be used to parse dynamically generated code. </p>

<p>The prototype compiler is fully functional and include a simple proof-of-concept macro.  This proof-of-concept macro takes a Java class whose fields have been annotated in a special way and automatically produces getter and setter methods for those annotated fields. </p>

<p>Compile-time macros can be used to implement a variety of additional language features with no further modifications to the compiler.  Notable examples include C++-like templates, aspect-oriented programming and closures.  Or non-Java languages like Python can be embedded directly in a Java source code comment, and converted to a parse tree at the appropriate time. </p>

<p>This feature was trivial to add.  JavaCompiler.parse() was modified to scan the import statements for macros and then execute them on the recently parsed tree.  However, this naive implementation, while a good prototype, has several problems. </p>

<p>In the prototype presented here, macros are included in a Java source code program by simply imported the macro class.  The compiler scans the parsed source file for import statements, tries to instantiate each imported class, and if the instantiated class implements the Macro interface, it is constructed using a no-argument constructor and executed. </p>

<p>This works but is inefficient.  I propose a change to the Java Language Specification, that would re-use the &quot;volatile&quot; keyword for macro declarations.  Similar to &quot;import static&quot; for procedural programming, &quot;import volatile&quot; would be used to execute a compile-time macro.  This language change is not implemented in the prototype compiler, but it should be trivial to adapt the parser. </p>

<p>Macros currently use the API in com.sun.tools.javac.tree to represent the parse tree.  This is suboptimal.  The classes in javax.lang.model would be better, but they need to be modified to support full alterations of a parse tree. </p>

<p>Also, failure modes are not robust in the prototype compiler.  It is unclear what should happen when a macro throws an exception.  Obviously the compiler should generate a parse error for the class being altered by the macro, but the compiler does not yet have the ability to report a stack trace as part of a parse error. </p>

<p>Finally, javadoc was not altered for the prototype.  Ideally javadoc would also execute compile-time macros, so that automatically generated members could have full documentation. </p>

<p>As macros exist solely at compile-time, I do not believe this language feature requires any changes to the reflection APIs. </p>

<p>I have rationales.  Java is rapidly losing mindshare to dynamic languages like Ruby and Python.  Adding compile-time macros can automate many repetitive development tasks while retaining the static safety of Java.</p>

 title : The java-open-search-servlet Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionOpenSearch is a collection of technologies that allow to publish search results  in a format suitable for syndication.  </p>

<p>It is a way for search engines to publish their search results in a standard and accessible format - taken from wikipedia  </p>

<p>for example: you have a site where you made custom search engine. all of your contents can be searched using your managed search engine. so you let your user browse your site and let them hit your content by searching through your web based search form. but i belief you have noticed how google and other search engines are working around.  </p>

<p>if you lucky guy like me of using firefox kinda browser you perhaps get a better searching experience. because you don&#39;t need to browse even google home page too, all your search are goes from the right most corner search text box.  </p>

<p>what if you could add your search engine their ?, obviously that would give you a better fortune to get more hits from your visitors. that’s how this open search standard works.  </p>

<p>it lets you add your searching URL syntax in a simple xml format. This open standard is meaning full to all open search supported browsers (firefox, ie 7…).  </p>

<p>so whenever visitor browse your site they get a hints about your search engine, whether they want to add it on his beloved browser or not.. that’s how they can add your search engine without knowing everything. </p>

<p>this project is an implementation of supporting open search format. this project is intended to assist you to generate the xml file on the fly, the all you have to do is just map the servlet and put your configuration properties file in your class path. </p>

<p>and play !!! </p>

<p>installationinstallation* download binary files from here </p>

<p>ensure &quot;open-search-1.0.jar&quot; file is on right place. WEB-INF\lib\open-search-1.0.jar </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionThis is a java implementation of Conway&#39;s Game of Life. </p>

<p>DetailsConway&#39;s Game of Life is a simple zero-person game built upon cellular automato theory. (See project links for more information on Conway&#39;s Game of Life). </p>

<p>The game was built for a graduate school Mod &amp; Sim course, so many ideas came from the basis of Modeling and Simulation Theory. </p>

<p>This project takes the game a step further, and allows the user to be more influential in the outcome of the game. The user can... </p>

<p>Change the size of the grid. Change the neighbor coloring scheme in order to see neighbor counts of living and dead cells. Automatically spawn new life and random configurations Manually spawn life at specified cells while the game is paused or simulating   Stop, pause, rewind, and fast forward the simulation at any point in time to see the causes of the current life configuration. </p>

<p>Life RulesMost important, this implemtentation stresses the important of the rules used to generate life during the game. The rules are faily straight forward: depending on the number of living cells around a current alive cell, it can either remain alive out of comfort, die out of loneliness, or die due to overcrowding. A dead cell can remain dead, or become alive if there are enough alive neighbors to reproduce. </p>

<p>However, our game raises the possibility, what if exact numbers were not used, but probabilities? Therefore, there is an X% chance that if there are a certain number of neighbors around a cell, it remains alive, or perhaps dies. </p>

<p>This game allows the users to create such rules, as well as use a number of predefined rules that result in interesting and beautiful arrangements of living and dead cells within the game. </p>

<p>Life StatisticsFirst-order Life statistics were added to the game in order to compute characteristics about each cell, such as: Birth/Death Correlation, Coefficient of variance, Life/Death Coefficeient of Skewness and Deviation. There are statistics about the entire board as well such as: Total Births/Deaths, Maximum Life/Death, and number of Generations.</p>

Peak performance on loopback network at about number_of_threads = number_of_cores+2 (highly approximate). Throughput loss is gradual tested up to 500 threads. For real networks (with notably more latency than loopback) a few thousand threads should perform well (of course use, -Xss96k or so) </p>

<p>Very high performance for string and small payloads because of streamlined code. Large payloads (i.e., big hashmaps) still benefit, but less so as the Java serialization mechanism is a serious bottleneck. </p>

 title : The javaongems Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Java on Gems README file</p>

<p>1. INTRODUCTION
<br/>Java on Gems (hereafter refererred to as Gems) is a framework extension for
<br/>the Google Widget Toolkit (GWT).</p>

<p>Gems is an acronym for (G)WT (E)xtension (M)odule(S). The reason why the name
<br/>Java has been prepended to Gems, is because unlike other GWT libraries
<br/>available, this library will be all Java with no more than 20% JSNI!</p>

<p>I use GWT to get as far away from Javascript as possible. Hence, the last
<br/>thing I want in a library is more Javascript dependencies.</p>

<p>Most Javascript libraries/widgets depend on Prototype and/or Scriptaculous to
<br/>function. This means that a GWT widget would need to wrap that library in JSNI
<br/>and then need to include both Prototype and/or script.aculo.us as part of the
<br/>distribution.</p>

<p>Instead, a Gems approach would be to port the functionality to pure Java and
<br/>leverage GWT’s JRE and user library for everything else.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is a violation of the following principle that I value:
<br/>“Minimize duplication/reinvention, maximize leverage”</p>

<p>Many will argue - why duplicate, when it is possible to leverage the
<br/>Javascript libraries/widgets in their current form. Based on my experiences,
<br/>the pain and suffering of porting and maintaining the code is significantly
<br/>less than attempting to debug and understand the semantics of a Javascript
<br/>implementation. Furthermore, the GWT Compiler optimizes the Java
<br/>implementation which may well make it more efficient.</p>

<p>2. CHANGES
<br/>GemsV2 is a significant overhaul of the original Gems project. Note, The
<br/>original source is still available in a tag and branch. However, this
<br/>release of Gems has a heavy client side focus. GemsV1 was based on my first
<br/>large content management system application that was built on GWT. However,
<br/>since then, my understanding of GWT and its sweet-spots has evolved. This
<br/>does not invalidate the need for many of the server side feature in GemsV1.
<br/>Some of these features may will re-appear, but will likely be heavily
<br/>refactored to take advantage of new GWT features and greater system knowledge.</p>

<p>3. LESSONS LEARNT FROM GemsV1+
<br/>* Dont assume your defect fixes to GWT user library will get picked and
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;incorporated into the GWT distribution
<br/>* Dont hack around with the module bootstrap process. This process logic
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;has changed between major releases and porting will hurt. It is also
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;likely to change again when dynamic module linking is supported
<br/>* Learn to live with GWT&#39;s widget API. Dont attempt to create a new component
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;model (regardless of how much better it is) unless you have the support
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of a community. It is likely that you will only end up creating these
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;scaffolds which will ultimately not get leveraged by others.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<br/>4. SAMPLE APPLICATION
<br/>The GemsV1 project was heavily leveraged in the Juls project. However, the
<br/>original Juls project has not been refactored to incorporate the GemV2
<br/>features. This project may get revitalised at another point in time.</p>

<p>Instead, a new project named &quot;gwt-Petstore&quot; has been created which fully
<br/>leverages the GemsV2 functionality.</p>

 title : The javapepper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JavaPepper is essentially a Java servlet that delegates the work of responding to user requests to lightweight servlet-like objects called responders. A responder may be general-purpose (such as one that outputs an image) or a special type of responder called a PepPage which serves up PepWidgets in order to create HTML pages. </p>

<p>Its design embraces JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, and all other potentially hard-to-use web technologies of the day. Java Pepper does not try to sugar-coat or hide these technologies from the software developer; it simply makes them more accessible and reuseable. </p>

<p>JavaPepper should be thought of as a library, a tool; not a framework.  </p>

 title : The javenue-process-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This framework assists in creating asynchronous processes that are modeled as persistent finite state machines. </p>

<p>Within the context of this framework, a process is a, possibly, long-running task that can be handed off to a service that executes tasks asynchronously. Generally this correlates to execution of the process/task in another thread. Services that allow work to be executed asynchronously include the java.util.concurrent.Executor, WorkManager implementations (from the commonj specification) or a message-driven service like JMS. </p>

<p>Processes defined using this framework define workflow. A process owns a process state which is manipulated via special callback interfaces called transitions. The process state defines a process&#39;s persistent properties. </p>

<p>Processes can be stopped mid-execution and later restarted. Support for idempotent business operations is also included. </p>

<p>Persistence and transaction management is &quot;pluggable&quot; and works with several popular solutions like Spring and Hibernate.</p>

 summary : <p>JBookTrader is a fully automated trading system (ATS) that can trade various types of market securities during the trading day without user monitoring. All aspects of trading, such as obtaining market prices, analyzing price patterns, making trading decisions, placing orders, monitoring order executions, and controlling the risk are automated according to the user preferences. The central idea behind JBookTrader is to completely remove emotions from trading, so that the trading system can systematically and consistently follow a predefined set of rules.  </p>

<p>The features include strategy back testing, optimization, market data recording, and real time trading via the Interactive Brokers API.  </p>

<p>JBookTrader is written in Java and is intended for software developers. It is not an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; product that can be installed and run. Instead, JBookTrader provides a framework for developing automated trading systems and requires a certain amount of programming knowledge and experience in Java. If you are not a software developer or if you don&#39;t have much experience programming in Java, JBookTrader is probably not for you.  </p>

<p>Before you start working with JBookTrader, please read the JBookTrader User Guide and the documents located in the /docs directory of the distribution.</p>

 title : The jcjobshop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Abstract: </p>

<p>The main aim of this work is to create small program based on constraint 
<br/>programming or solving shop scheduling problems e.q Job-shop, Flow-shop, Open-shop	 
<br/>Introduction: </p>

<p>Scheduling problems are combinatorial and optimizing problems (often 
<br/>NP-hard) and thus can be described by constraints -&gt; constraint base 
<br/>scheduling is good approach for solving mentioned problems. 
<br/>We use gecode (www.gecode.org) constraint programming library. 
<br/>Benefits of this library are: open-source, speed  
<br/>Disadvantages are: it is still in the progress - lack of 
<br/>documentation. 
<br/>  Installation: </p>

<p> Install gecode library (http://www.gecode.org/download.html) 2. Download sources: 
<br/>(http://code.google.com/p/jcjobshop/downloads/list) 
<br/>or checkout from svn repository 
<br/>svn checkout http://jcjobshop.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jcjobshop 
<br/>3. Compile sources (make) 
<br/>4. Copy bin/shop.mexglx to location of Matlab path 
<br/>5. enjoy 
<br/>  Usage: </p>

<p>Usage from Matlab is very simple.  </p>

<p>runtime = shop(R,P,ShopType ) 
<br/>R ... matrix of resources 
<br/>P ... matrix of processing times 
<br/>ShopType: 
<br/>- &#39;1&#39; Job-shop 
<br/>- &#39;2&#39; Open-shop 
<br/>- &#39;3&#39; Flow-shop 
<br/>StartTimes ... matrix containing start times of each task in each 
<br/>jobs. 
<br/>runtime ... solving time in ms</p>

 title : The jcouchdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>jcouchdbjcouchdb is a java5 couchdb driver using the svenson JSON library. </p>

<p>It offers features to support the full range from totally dynamic parsing to parsing into concrete java POJOs, including a mix in between. </p>

<p>jcouchdb is in the early stages of development but there&#39;s a test suite proving that it does at least most of the couchdb operations.  </p>

<p>Hood Example ApplicationOn the occasion of presenting CouchDB and jcouchdb at my place of work, I got around to finally create a small example application that is now downloadable as sneak preview. There need to be bugs fixed, features implemented and lots of documentation to be added, but it kind of works. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;Hood&quot; for neighbourhood and allows you to mark places or people around a place of activity of yours, called hood. it is meant to foster collaboration / tips on local places etc.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s Spring Web Application demonstrating some techniques of working with jcouchdb. It&#39;s an eclipse WTP/Spring IDE project with all dependencies you need besides couchdb and tomcat or another servlet container. </p>

<p>The current version, beta 2, still lacks some features but is a lot closer to the goal. The design is a lot nicer now, lots of documentation and bugfixed added. </p>

<p>You can check out the Hood API Doc to get a basic overview. </p>

<p>If you want to follow the development, the sources can be checked out anonymously via SVN at </p>

<p>http://jcouchdb.googlecode.com/svn/examples/hoodDocumentationApart from the jcouchdb tutorial and the svenson documentation, you can also browse the jcouchdb javadoc. </p>

<p>Version systemWith the current release, I switched to a different versioning system containing the release of couchdb the jcouchdb version is meant to be run with followed by a release counter.  </p>

<p>Maven RepositorySo far I haven&#39;t been able to get the jcouchdb and svenson jars into the maven repos. If you want to use maven, you can use the following repository </p>

<p>    
<br/>

<br/>    ChangelogChanges from 0.10.0-2 to 0.10.0-3: </p>

<p>Fix encoding inconsistencies  Use DocumentHelper for bulkDeleteDocuments, change signature to List Properly escape spaces and other characters in URLs. Changes from 0.10.0-1 to 0.10.0-2:   </p>

<p>added support for uuids and replication support use cases with app global JSON config. See Hood Beta 2 for details. Fixed serious bug regarding JSONParser runs influencing each others JSON config in some situations.   </p>

<p>Changes from 0.9.1-2 to 0.10.0-1: </p>

<p>compatibility with couchdb 0.10.0: attachment revpos, new list function format add ResourceSync to sync folders on disk with document attachments, MediaTypeUtil to determine media type by name. add Database.setJsonGenerator(JSON) to suport configuration of JSON output minor bugfixes Changes from 0.9.1-1 to 0.9.1-2: </p>

<p>Added JarBasedCouchDBUpdater that can update views from a directory or jar in the classpath support for show and list support for stats now uses slf4j as logging API switched to httpcomments http-client 4.0 from the old commons-httpclient-3.x now available via Maven  bugfix: added DocumentValidationException to access reason of validation errors. bugfix: don&#39;t escape startkey_docid, endkey_docid anymore support for all_or_nothing bulk creation, support for bulk delete. Thanks to Daniel Trümper for submitting the patches </p>

<p>Version 0.7 breaks API compatibilityI regret to have to inform you that because of the new features for the upcoming 0.9 release, which made the old way of keeping around methods which do not accept Options and JSONParser parameters too bothersome, I removed those methods in the old API and added no new ones in jcouchdb 0.7. </p>

<p>For your old code to work, you must now pass null where you don&#39;t haven Options and/or a JSONParser. </p>

 title : The jelan Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JELAN is an embedded language analyzer for Java.   </p>

<p>It provides facilities for constructing and invoking LL(1) language lexical analyzers and parsers.  These are embedded in the sense that a language can be specified and then used for textual analysis within the same java program.  This avoids the need for a separate generation phase to write and compile a lexical analyzer and parser from the language specification. </p>

<p>The current version is an early release that is not used for any production projects but is basically functional. It has been developed to explore an embedded approach to language analysis.  See the page UsingJelan for basic JELAN usage. </p>

<p>The following is an example specification of a simple arithmentic expression grammar that supports &#39;+-*/%^&#39; operators and &#39;min&#39; and &#39;max&#39; functions using JELAN: </p>

<p>        SeqRule expression = new SeqRule(&quot;expression&quot;);  // forward
<br/>        Rule number = NumberToken.TYPE_RULE;
<br/>        Rule signedNumber = choice(
<br/>                seq(MINUS, save(NEG_NUMBER, number)),
<br/>                seq(opt(PLUS), save(NUMBER, number)));
<br/>        Rule functionOp = save(OPERATOR, choice(MAX,MIN));
<br/>        Rule function = call(seq(functionOp, OPEN, expression, COMMA, expression, CLOSE));
<br/>        Rule primary = choice(signedNumber, function, seq(OPEN, expression, CLOSE)); 
<br/>        Rule exponentiationOp = save(OPERATOR, EXP);
<br/>        Rule factor  = seq(primary, repeat(call(seq(exponentiationOp, primary))));
<br/>        Rule multiplicativeOp = save(OPERATOR, choice(STAR, DIV, MOD));
<br/>        Rule term  = seq(factor, repeat(call(seq(multiplicativeOp, factor))));

<p>   jenabean uses Jena&#39;s flexible RDF/OWL api to persist java beans.  It takes an unconventional approach to binding that is driven by the java object model rather than an OWL or RDF schema.  jenabean is annotation based and does not place any interface or extension requirements on your java object model.  By default jenabean uses typical java bean conventions to derive RDF property URI’s, for example, the java bean property “name” would become RDF property “:name”.  jenabean allows for explicit binding between an object property and a particular RDF property.  (See Book.java for an example of binding arbitrary bean properties to the Dublin Core schema.)  </p>

 title : The jetlang Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Jetlang provides a high performance java threading library. The library is based upon Retlang. </p>

<p>The library is a complement to the java.util.concurrent package introduced in 1.5 and should be used for message based concurrency similar to event based actors in Scala. </p>

<p>The library does not provide remote messaging capabilities. It is designed specifically for high performance in-memory messaging. </p>

<p>FeaturesAll messages to a particular Fiber are delivered sequentially. Components can easily keep state without synchronizing data access or worrying about thread races. Single Fiber interface that can be backed by a dedicated thread or a thread pool. Supports single or multiple subscribers for messages. Subscriptions for single events or event batching Single or recurring event scheduling High performance design optimized for low latency and high scalability Publishing is thread safe, allowing easy integration with other threading models. Low Lock Contention - Minimizing lock contention is critical for performance. Other concurrency solutions are limited by a single lock typically on a central thread pool or message queue. Jetlang is optimized for low lock contention. Without a central bottleneck, performance easily scales to the needs of the application. Powerful Async Request/Reply Support Single jar with no dependencies except the jdk (1.6+) ExampleFiber fiber = new ThreadFiber();

 title : The jiffy-web Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Jiffy OverviewJiffy is an end-to-end real-world web page instrumentation and measurement suite. The first beta was released on 6/23/2008, as announced at O&#39;Reilly Velocity 2008. Here&#39;s a a copy of the slides and here&#39;s the video. </p>

<p>Jiffy was built and is maintained by the WhitePages.com team. </p>

<p>Jiffy allows developers to  </p>

<p>measure individual pieces of page rendering (script load, AJAX execution, page load, etc.) on every client report those measurements and other metadata to a web server aggregate web server logs into a database generate reports  Additionally, using the Jiffy extension for Firebug built by Bill Scott from Netflix, developers can see and test Jiffy-based measurements. </p>

<p>Jiffy ComponentsThe system consists of the following components: </p>

<p>Jiffy.js, the Javascript library used for generating measurements; it&#39;s tested across IE6 &amp; 7, FF2 &amp; 3, and Safari 3. Documentation here. Apache proxy (httpd.conf) configuration for logging Jiffy posts An ingestor (written in Perl) which runs on the Apache server and posts logs to a database through DBI. Documentation here, plus a SampleJiffyLog. Working DDLs for Oracle XE and higher. Documentation here. We haven&#39;t (yet) provided DDL&#39;s for other databases, but the database model described in the documentation has been tested in a MySQL installation. Reporting rollup code for Oracle (MySQL to come) A reporting UI using the Yahoo! User Interface library  </p>

<p>Using JiffyYou can use Jiffy end-to-end by  </p>

<p>including Jiffy.js in your pages and instrumenting them with the appropriate mark and measure calls Making the configuration changes needed to your proxy Adding the ingestor as a cron job on your web servers, with appropriate connection strings Setting up the data model Editing the reporting configuration and deploying the reporting tools More simply, you can combine Jiffy and the Firebug add-in to view Mark &amp; Measure results for a single developer client. </p>

<p>Note that there are a fair number of dependencies across the system, assuming that you can set up a fairly heterogeneous environment. Obviously much of the code and config is easily ported to single systems, and we may later combine parts. </p>

<p>Apache 2.X for the proxy config (untested in previous versions, but it will probably work) Perl 5.8 or later for the ingestor Oracle XE and higher  PHP &gt;5.2.0 or PECL json: &gt;= 1.2.0 for the reporting tools, plus online access to the Yahoo! User Interface Library (which you could copy and serve in-house)  To use Jiffy, checkout the source from the Source tab above. You&#39;ll need an svn client. </p>

<p>Contacting UsWe&#39;re currently supporting the project through the jiffy-web Google Group: please send questions, problems, etc. there.  </p>

<p>Join the Project!There&#39;s still plenty of work to do to improve Jiffy, including </p>

<p>More database options (we really need a MySQL port) Improvements to reporting tools A means to glue jiffy.js to your automated test suite Documentation and use-case improvement Aggregated log parsing (rather than per-web-server log parsing) as an option We&#39;re still figuring out the plan for accepting patches - for now we&#39;re going to use the Google Group for everything.</p>

 summary : <p>The best way to learn how interpreters and runtime environments work is by actually attempting to write one.

So now I am into Scheme and trying to write one for Scheme.SICP&#39;s chapter on meta linguistic abstractions offers a good starting point.</p>
 summary : <p>MBNCSUtil is a lightweight Battle.net library used for developing client applications by implementing the authentication and versioning protocols.  It works well for people who want to implement the client connection by themselves, but who don&#39;t want the fuss of having to reimplement all of the complex math and code for authenticating their client. </p>

<p>BN# (BN-Sharp) takes it a step further and implements a fully-featured, event-based API for creating client connections to Battle.net.  The connection is abstracted away from the developer, allowing the developer to focus on rich features.  BN# is highly optimized and flexible; incoming packets can be prioritized, events can be prioritized -- or you can ignore that entirely. </p>

<p>JinxBot is a synthesis of BN# - it is a plugin-oriented Battle.net client that can emulate Starcraft, Diablo II, Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition, and Warcraft III.  It provides a rich user interface and optional features such as clan management and moderation. </p>

<p>JinxBot.Controls is a separate library used by JinxBot to facilitate client development in Windows Forms.  It implements controls such as docking, tabbed interfaces, and chat windows.  The chat window interface is based in HTML and is extensible with some simple class implementations, so you can come up with new controls on your own. </p>

<p>JinxBotWeb is a plugin for JinxBot and a web application that uses ASP.NET AJAX and WCF to bubble events from JinxBot to a web site that then allows the channel JinxBot is currently residing in to be viewed from a browser. </p>

<p>JinxBotWeb will stay as part of this repository, but you can find additional plugins at http://jinxbot-plugins.googlecode.com/.</p>

<p>About jLynxIn a nutshell jLynx is a simple, lite, hi-performance layer over the JDBC API. Persist and retrieve POJOs from the database. Designed for developer productivity, it is simple to configure and deploy. No XML configuration. </p>

<p>Excellent choice for a small applications or prototypes or applications when JDBC is chosen over JPA for performance reasons. Pick the right tool for the job; and when the job is simple, jlynx is a good choice. </p>

<p>Fewer peristence features than the well-known alternatives, yet jLynx capably handles CRUD operations with minimal configuration, hassle and complexity. jLynx is perfectly suited for small or mid-size applications (or micro-sized embedded applications due to it&#39;s small footprint). jLynx is best suited for Java developers who have a good understanding of databases and SQL. </p>

<p>jLynx can generate POJOs based on your database schema. For example, if you have 24 tables and views in your database, jLynx will create 24 objects with fields that map to the column names in each table. </p>

<p>jLynx has all the necessary methods to persist objects and fetch entire collections of objects. jLynx leverages the strengths of SQL and the strengths of Java without having to write/maintain J2EE code. It is truly the best of both worlds. </p>

<p>Summary of FeaturesTiny, lightweight component (44K JAR) with no dependencies other than SLF4J (logging) Simple configuration uses YAML Simple API... perfect for small-to-medium sized applications POJO, CLOB, BLOB persistence Tested on SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2/UDB, Informix, MySQL, PostgreSQL and HSQL POJO &amp; HTML code generation Outputs lists as JSON, XML or Java objects (POJOs or Maps) Uses native SQL, not a custom query language Requires JRE 1.3 or higher  Available via Maven   or Ivy  </p>

 summary : <p>JMesa is a dynamic HTML table that allows you to filter, sort, paginate, export and edit your data however you need to. What you will find here is a carefully thought out API that is very easy to use and can be modified for your own needs. Note: JMesa requires JDK 1.5 or above. As of version 2.3.4 you can use the JBoss Retro project to run JMesa under JDK 1.4. </p>

<p>Notice: I am sorry to say that we need to abandon ship on the original JMesa groups page. You may have noticed that the spam is totally out of control now. Ideally I could just change the settings of the groups but I have lost ownership privileges. I have tried numerous times to get help but Google seems to be letting the whole groups management run on cruise control now. So I have set up a new groups page with the hope that by locking down the settings we can get the spam eliminated. Unfortunately this means that I have to approve everyone that wants to sign up. I do not mind doing it, but I really liked how easy it was to (non)manage the groups. </p>

<p>To see the live examples just download the example war file and place it in your servlet container. It was tested with Tomcat 6, but should work with any servlet container. If you need help with JMesa I would ask that you use the Google Groups set up. As similar questions get posted on the groups I will add those questions and answers to the Recipes page. Per user request the javadocs are now online as well! </p>

<p>10/16/2009 :  The JMesa 2.4.5 release fixes some small bugs and offers a few improvements to the API. </p>

<p>12/31/2009 :  The JMesa 2.4.6 release fixes some small bugs. In addition there is a new HtmlTableBuilder class to build tables using the fluent pattern. </p>

<p>Creating tables with JMesa is very easy. For instance to create an HTML table with every feature available can be accomplished in four lines of code: </p>

<p>TableFacade tableFacade = TableFacadeFactory.createTableFacade(id, request);
<br/>tableFacade.setColumnProperties(&quot;name.firstName&quot;, &quot;name.lastName&quot;, &quot;term&quot;, &quot;career&quot;, &quot;born&quot;);
<br/>tableFacade.setItems(items);
<br/>String html = tableFacade.render();To fully customize this table is just as easy. You can find out more by reading the recipes, tutorials, and examples. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>David Sills has an article on JMesa at JavaLobby. It is a great article that taps into just how customizable JMesa is! Ayan Dutta wrote up a page about using JMesa with Struts1.x. In addition there has been a sighting of JMesa out on Tech Blog. </p>

<p>Now that the apache commons BeanUtils 1.8 is released I would highly recommend using it with JMesa. The BeanUtils is a core library in JMesa and the 1.8 release works great with nested beans. </p>

<p>Tip: Did you know that you can save the state of the table so when a user returns to a JMesa table it looks exactly how they saw it last? I just updated one of our internal sites to use the feature throughout and it occurred to me that this may be a hidden feature to many developers. </p>

<p>10/25/2008 :  This is more or less a call to the community that want Maven support. If you would like the JMesa jar file in the Maven repositories I have decided to leave it up to the community to finish the work started. There is some support for Maven in that you can pull the jar from my site. </p>

<p>7/09/2009 :  I am posting this out as a call for help from the community and see if anyone is interested in updating the Grails plugin! If you are just contact me at jeff.johnston.mn@gmail.com and I will try to help in any way that I can. </p>

<p>It would be great to have more Locales supported out of the box. If your Locale is not currently supported you should consider taking some time to create a messages file and send it to me. More details are on the Messages page. </p>

<p>In Other News...9-26-2009 I started a project that Spring users may be interested in. It is called Configleon and solves the problem of loading property attributes in different environments and/or server contexts. With Configleon you can build one war file that can be deployed to every location.  </p>

<p>2-26-2010 I have released a new alert system, called Alertleon. It is tightly integrated with Configleon and offers an advanced way to trigger email events in your application. </p>

<p>3-4-2010 I have released a new ORM framework, called OpenORM. It is unique in that it fits right in the middle of other frameworks that either try to do too much, or too little. I like to think of it as fitting in the middle of Hibernate and iBatis.</p>

<p>What is JMTPSynchronizer?JMTPSynchronizer is a very simple interface for adding, deleting and retrieving content from your MTP device (For example Creative Zen Vision M), with a Linux desktop. More details on MTP and a list of music devices using this can be obtained from wikipedia MTP page. It has a front-end written in Java and a back-end written in c++. It has been written and tested on Ubuntu and can be used in it.  </p>

<p>It can possibly be used in other Linux distributions, but it hasn&#39;t been tested. In case you downloaded and used it in a distribution other than Ubuntu then please inform me. </p>

<p>JMTPSynchronizer is written in my leisure time and currently has very poor code quality (especially the back-end written in C++). I have programmed a lot in Java but am very new to C++ and so I haven&#39;t followed any proper coding conventions or good guidelines in writing the back-end. However, now that I have realized that it actually works quite well, I am working on cleaning up the code.  </p>

<p>If you are interested in improving or making changes in it then please wait for now while I finish cleaning it up. I will soon release another version, which has proper code documentation and follows proper conventions. </p>

<p>How do I install it?Installing JMTPSynchronizer involves two things. </p>

<p>Installing the back-end API (command line mtpsyncxml) which it uses to interact with MTP device. Installing the Java front-end which calls the back-end API. Complete installation steps are here - Installation instructions. Follow the instructions there after reading this page. </p>

<p>What does it depend on?It depends on the following libraries (these will be installed when you follow the installation instructions) - </p>

<p>libmtp – A library to interact with mtp device. Can be obtained from http://libmtp.sourceforge.net libxml2 - A library for loading/saving xml files. Java - For best experience use IcedTea java provided in ubuntu repositories. </p>

<p>Where can I get help?Read the instructions here on how to use it - Using JMTPSynchronizer. </p>

<p>In case you have problems installing it then please contact me either directly (at my gmail id shown on right) or in Ubuntu forums (send me the link) and I will try my best to help you. </p>

 summary : <p>Abstract </p>

<p>Joopl! The grand unified theory in action... </p>

<p>It should have been thougt-of years ago. Why do we all have to learn several different component languages to develop for the web? If we are to believe the Web 2.0 buzz, the web has become a platform itself. If the web is a platform, then a single comprehensive language should exist to create applications for it. In other words, a language that will interface with the existing client-side and server-side languages, and create not a “web-site” but a “web-application”.  
<br/>Joopl! is planned to be an XML-based Framework language that allows you to write one set of mark-up to create a web-application. Its not a difficult proposition. Conceptually this is easily grasped. While dozens of useful frameworks exist to “ease the development” of applications, they still require a working knowledge of multiple languages. 
<br/>Joopl! intends to work on the concept of the developer using a single &quot;modular&quot; concept model for developing applications with a simple XML based language.  
<br/>In its essence Joopl strives to be the one language that will create individual web-applications. Presently the development the processing for Joopl! involves the following component steps. 
<br/>Joopl XML → XSLT/PHP Server → Output </p>

<p>Javascript and PHP work well together, along with their XHTML output, for creating web-applications. Both of these languages are free and readily available to developers for use. Certain procedures and “tricks” have come-about with scripting languages to create a number of useful procedures for creating web applications, but a working-knowledge of at least three languages is required to create them. 
<br/>The purpose of Joopl is to provide a singular XML-based framework language to create and specify both server-side and client side aspects of a web-application.</p>

<p>所以，如果对当前的样式不满意的，可以随意针对xml文件写新的xslt文件，也可以针对xml用air或者其他各种方式实现自己的版本。如果你喜欢先前html版的配色，也可以自己写一个。 </p>

<p>当然，如果是翻译内容的问题的话，直接提出来吧。我会及时修改的。 </p>

<p>注意： 最近打算把中文文档的xml的格式迁移到新版jQuery的格式，新版格式有很多优点。所以如果希望写自己的样式的话，请参照这里： http://api.jquery.com/api/ 这是一个xml文件，另存为之后就可以看到其结构了。</p>

<p>Version 1.1Now using the $.widget framework in jquery-ui 1.7 Meaning it will work with the themes roller for jquery along side the other ui components </p>

<p>Fixes for compatability with ie, webkit and moz </p>

<p>jQuery-htmlClean now does formatting </p>

<p>now ~14K min&#39;d if you want clean html you also need jquery-clean ~6K min&#39;d </p>

<p>nb The featured download also includes the latest jquery-clean </p>

<p>exampleWhere you have a textarea like this... </p>

<p>    Call htmlInput in a script block like this... </p>

<p>    // set as default for all htmlInputs
<br/>    $.ui.htmlInput.defaults.styleUrl = &quot;content/editor.css&quot;;
<br/>    $(&quot;#Input&quot;).htmlInput();</p>

<p>    // set up the html input, set style url for this one only
<br/>    $(&quot;#Input&quot;).htmlInput({styleUrl: &quot;content/editor.css&quot;});
<br/>see the jquery.htmlInput.test.htm file in the featured download for a fuller example </p>

<p>1.1 Compatability LayerThe method used to create a htmlInput has been changed so that it works in the way that the jQuery-ui widget factory requires. This has the advantage of being able to create many htmlInputs at a time and in the way a jQuery ui developer would expect (see the example above). In v1.0 it was more like a function returning the htmlInput object. e.g. </p>

<p>    var myHtmlInput = new $.htmlInput(&quot;#Input&quot;);While you are converting to the new way you can add the following to your main script to provide compatability with the older versions </p>

<p>    $.htmlInput = function(element, options){
<br/>        return $(element).htmlInput().data(&quot;htmlInput&quot;);
<br/>    };Version 1.0Requires </p>

<p>jQuery  http://jquery.com   jQuery.htmlClean  http://code.google.com/p/jquery-clean  </p>

<p>This is a light weight (~12K min&#39;d) script and does not contain support for all html entities (for example there&#39;s no table editing)  </p>

<p>It does however have the following; </p>

<p>Bold Italic Superscript Subscript Headers Preformatted text Lists Links Images </p>

<p>You can switch on and off the features you want </p>

<p>Add your own stylesheet to the editor </p>

<p>You can have your own popups for Links and Images, the current popups are scripted windows which are a bit naff looking (probably add a better default at some time)</p>

 title : The jquery-json Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Important: 2.0 is not backwards compatible with the previous versions.  Changes in version 2.0 are described below. </p>

<p>This plugin makes it simple to convert to and from JSON: </p>

<p>var thing = {plugin: &#39;jquery-json&#39;, version: 2.2};</p>

<p>var encoded = $.toJSON(thing);              //&#39;{&quot;plugin&quot;:&quot;jquery-json&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:2.2}&#39;
<br/>var name = $.evalJSON(encoded).plugin;      //&quot;jquery-json&quot;
<br/>var version = $.evalJSON(encoded).version;  // 2.2Most people asked me why I would want to do such a thing, which boggles my mind.  Javascript makes it relatively easy to convert from JSON, thanks to eval(), but converting to JSON is supposedly  an edge requirement. </p>

<p>This plugin exposes four new functions onto the $, or jQuery object: </p>

<p>toJSON: Serializes a javascript object, number, string, or arry into JSON. evalJSON: Converts from JSON to Javascript, quickly, and is trivial. secureEvalJSON: Converts from JSON to Javascript, but does so while checking to see if the source is actually JSON, and not with other Javascript statements thrown in. quoteString: Places quotes around a string, and inteligently escapes any quote, backslash, or control characters. </p>

<p>Changes in Version 2.0 </p>

<p>The code has been re-written.  It is now easier to read and follow; less of a mish-mash. Support for native JSON has been included.  This means that if you are using a browser that supports JSON.stringify, it will be used.  Also evalJSON and secureEvalJSON will use JSON.parse if available. Changes were made in the JSON output to move in line with the JSON object standard.  This means 2.0 is not backwards compatible with the previous versions. toJSON now renders like compactJSON used to and compactJSON does not exist anymore.  As per the JSON object standard, needless spaces are now removed.  This makes it less readable; if someone wants to send me a prettyJSON patch, it will be welcome. Differences between output when JSON.stringify is available and when it is not could exist.  I am unable to test all strings.  Be aware when testing your apps. </p>

 summary : <p>js-scheme is a Scheme interpreter written in JavaScript. </p>

<p>The Featured Download is updated every other week or so.  New revisions will be added in between each release; see the Source tab for the latest code. </p>

<p>There are two versions of js-scheme.  They are identical for the most part - except for that the one tagged CPS supports first-class continuations, while the other only supports continuations as exit procedures.  As of version 0.4, no further development is planned for the CPS version. </p>

<p>LibrariesStarting in version 0.4 two extensions are packaged with the main download: a primitive API wrapper for Last.fm Web Services, and an interface to the flot JavaScript graphing library. </p>

<p>The load procedure can be used to load a library.  For example, (load &#39;last.fm) and (load &#39;flot).  After loading, information about a library can be displayed using the help procedure.  For example, (help &#39;last.fm) and (help &#39;flot).  The help message will usually display a list of procedures included with the library.   </p>

<p>The convention so far has been for each library to prefix its procedures with its name and a colon mark.  For example, last.fm:User.getRecentTracks and flot:plotf.   </p>

<p>Library APIIdeally writing a custom library plugin for js-scheme is very easy.  A &quot;library&quot; is defined as an extension of the JSCMLib class.  The constructor of the library should call $super with the string that it can be loaded with via the load procedure.   Library classes should also define name, procedures, and doc fields.  name is a string name to display in the help message heading, procedures is a Hash of the Builtin library procedures, and doc is an HTML string to display as the help message body.  For example: </p>

<p>var FooBarLib = Class.create(JSCMLib, {
<br/>  initialize: function($super) {
<br/>    $super(&#39;foo-bar&#39;);
<br/>    this.name = &#39;FOO BAR LIBRARY&#39;;
<br/>    this.procedures = new Hash({
<br/>      &#39;foo-bar:baz&#39;: new Builtin(&#39;baz&#39;, function(args) { 
<br/>        /* do baz */
<br/>      }.bind(this), &#39;This is the baz procedure documentation.&#39;, &#39;arg1 arg2&#39;)
<br/>    });
<br/>    this.doc = &#39;Welcome to the Foo Bar Library!</p>

<p>&#39;;
<br/>  }
<br/>}</p>

<p>jscm_registerLib(&#39;foo-bar&#39;, FooBarLib);The final step is to call jscm_registerLib with the string loading name again, and the extended library class. </p>

<p>All of the js-scheme classes and procedures are of course available by default to libraries.  (More documentation will be provided later in the wiki).</p>

<p>Check out QuickStart. </p>

<p>Write Cocoa apps in Javascript ! JSCocoa allows calling Cocoa and C functions through JavascriptCore (Webkit&#39;s Javascript engine), using BridgeSupport and libffi to call C functions and allocate C structs. Calling Objective C is done via ObjCRuntime. </p>

 summary : <p>jscsh is an interactive JavaScript shell similar to Ruby&#39;s irb or the interactive Python shell. It uses Apple&#39;s JavaScriptCore for its internal JS engine and provides several built-in function with similar functionality to SpiderMonkey&#39;s js shell. </p>

<p>jscsh is very early in development, but can run and load any JavaScripts which use the built-in JavaScript classes (no DOM or XMLHttpRequest support). It&#39;s already pretty fast. It also has an interface to system(3) and a wrapper around popen(3). </p>

<p>jscsh also includes several classes inspired by classes from the Ruby standard library. Dir, File, and IO all have at least partial implementations. </p>

<p>jscsh is still young and immature, but it allows for high performance JavaScript without the need for a web browser. </p>

<p>Standard Global ObjectsIn addition to JavaScript&#39;s built-in standard global objects, jscsh also provides a additional StandardGlobalObjects which are written in a combination of C and JavaScript. </p>

<p>JSoarPerformance JSoarDebugger System Requirementsjsoar requires Java 1.6. It uses several features of Java 1.6 that are not available in earlier versions of Java.

See also Java16FeaturesUsedByJSoar and RunningJSoarOnMac. </p>

<p>About the codeFor the most part, I&#39;m currently concentrating on a direct port of CSoar with minimal refactoring along the way. This means that most members are public (or package private) just like the structs the classes are based upon. It will be easier to refactor once the whole thing is ported. You never know what horror lurks around the next corner. As an additional precaution, whenever possible I am marking members final and initializing in a constructor. </p>

<p>One convention I&#39;m following is to include a string like this in the Javadoc for each method: </p>

<p>   rete.cpp:1011:find_goal_for_match_set_change_assertionAlthough the filename and line number aren&#39;t that interesting, the method name is important. Once the port is complete, I&#39;m going to go back through and rename methods to make them more Java-y. Preserving the original names in the comments allows us to go back later and keep track of where code went when moved from C to Java. </p>

<p>概述json-rpc-for-java，是仅仅不到100行的javascript代码和不到10个java文件实现的超级轻量级的通过 javaScript快速调用java对象并返回任意对象的轻量级框架，并且支持级联调用，也就是说不需要额外 的JavaScript编程，就可以通过javascript调用被注册的java对象并返回java对象，如果被返回的对象 还有方法，这个在javascript中返回的java对象的变量，你还可以继续调用它的方法.....这就是这个轻 量级json-rpc-for-java的神奇之处。 当返回的是java对象List的时候，在javascript中体现为ArrayList，如果是Map，着体现为js中的 Object，其他的和java中的调用基本相同。 特殊的地方是，通过JS调用java对象方法的时候只能传入简单类型的参数，比 如：String,int,float,long等。 </p>

<p>注意事项如果你的java服务对象返回的是Object、Bean、Map或者自定义对象，不能有属性name_、id_，这两个属性被本框架内部使用 </p>

<p>Overview  </p>

<p>json-rpc-for-java, is only less than 100 lines of javascript code and less than 10 java files to achieve the adoption of the super-lightweight java objects javaScript quick call and return to the lightweight arbitrary object framework, and support level joint call, which means no additional JavaScript? programming, they can be registered through the javascript to call the java object and return java object, the object is returned if there are ways to return to this in the javascript in the java object variables, You can also continue to call it ..... This is the way to the lightweight json-rpc-for-java&#39;s magic. When they returned to the List when the java object, embodied in the javascript for the ArrayList?, If it is Map, reflected in the js in the Object, and other java call in basically the same. Special place is that by JS call java object can only be imported when the parameters of simple types, such as: String, int, float, long, etc..  </p>

<p>Notes  </p>

<p>If you return to the java client is the Object, Bean, Map or custom objects, can not have attributes name, id, these two attributes for internal use by the framework  </p>

 title : The json-xml-rpc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Version 0.8.1.1 of PHP server has been released. See the changelog. </p>

<p>XML-RPC and JSON-RPC have enabled Ajax developers to cleanly send and receive data from the server. By providing an API in either RPC protocol, the server and client application logic are kept separate and multiple clients may be written using the same server API. The similarity between XML-RPC and JSON-RPC motivates the development of client and server libraries which abstract-away the differences between the two protocols. The client libraries available here allow requests to be made in either XML-RPC or JSON-RPC to the same service, and the server implementations available provide responses according to the type of RPC request provided. The desired request and response formats are determined by setting the Content-Type and Accept headers respectively to application/json and text/xml accordingly. </p>

<p>The implementations support every JSON date format currently used, including: </p>

<p>ISO 8601 @ticks@ string format (about) ASP.NET AJAX \/Date(ticks)\/ string format (about) JSON-RPC 1.0 class hinting (about) These date formats are automatically converted into native date objects (such as Date for JavaScript and DateTime for PHP), and you may specify the preferred format for date serialization. </p>

<p>The client allows for asynchronous as well as synchronous calls. The server library allows developers to turn any function into a RPC method since it does not require special parameters to be passed or special values to be returned; all native data types are handled automatically. </p>

<p>The client and server implementations allow for cross-site requests in JSON-RPC by means of the &quot;JSON-response-callback&quot; extension. The &quot;JSON-omit-response-wrapper&quot; server extension is also implemented to allow for the Procedure Return object wrapper to be omitted so that the JSON result data alone is returned (this allows the server to be used in conjunction with Ext&#39;s AsyncTreeNode, for example). </p>

<p>These libraries implement the 7 August 2006 working draft of JSON-RPC 1.1, which is mostly backwards compatible with JSON-RPC 1.0, including class hinting. They also implement XML-RPC with the discriminated null value extension. </p>

 summary : <p>SummaryJsonExSerializer is a serializer/deserializer framework for C# that uses JSON format for its storage format.  A small number of extensions are added to facilitate correct reconstruction of the object upon deserialization.  It is mainly intended to serialize objects to and from a storage medium, but it fully supports being used in an AJAX/web environment as well.  See the SetJsonStrictOptions on the extensions page for how to turn off the extensions if transmitting to a browser. See the Tutorial and Usage pages for examples on how to use it. </p>

<p>Why?I wanted a framework that I could use to persist objects to disk.  I also wanted something that was human readable and easy to edit.  Binary serialization is not human readable, and I didn&#39;t want to use xml because I found it too verbose for this purpose.  I examined a few other JSON packages, but found nothing that could recreate the object graph exactly as it was deserialized.  Especially if normal OO techniques such as inheritance were used.  None of the implementations could handle references as well, which was pretty important to me. </p>

<p>FeaturesEasy to use: Serialize an object in about 2-3 lines of code. Deserialize objects exactly as you serialized them with References intact Supports classes, structs, Generics, properties and public fields Support for constructors with arguments Serialization can be controlled programmatically, with .NET attributes, or using app.config Easy customization, just create a different object to serialize which could be a Dictionary, String, ArrayList or any other type that you choose Formatted output by default so its easy to read, or you can serialize it compactly if you choose Can be customized to use your own factories or dependency injection frameworks when constructing objects IssuesBug reports can be submitted to the issue log.  Issues or questions about JsonExSerializer can be posted to the JsonExSerializer discussion group. </p>

<p>News3.1 is in the works and should be released soon.  Check the blog for the new features that will be going in. Moved the blog from blogspot to wordpress.  Should make it easier to post code samples Release 3.0 is the latest stable release. See ReleaseNotes for more details.  It provides much greater capability for customization over the previous release as well as some key bug fixes for internalization issues. See the wiki for more Usage and explanation of features.</p>

 title : The jsonsharp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JSONSharp - C# meets JSONJSONSharp is a C# library for generating JSON-formatted data.  The library is very lightweight and fully object-oriented. The library was born out of a need to generate JSON-compliant strings from the server-side of a .Net application. The library is easily extensible to handle specific implementations to ease the syntactical burden of incorporating the library into your own project. </p>

<p>{07/25/2007}: How to make ASP.NET user controls return as JSONI put together a new example that uses Jsonsharp to return any user control to a JSON string.  There&#39;s a complete working example available on our download page, but you should check out the blog entry first. </p>

<p>{07/24/2007}: Jsonsharp and the GPLThere have been a few private questions posed to me about using jsonsharp with other projects (some personal, some commercial).  Unfortunately, licensing matters tend to cause more questions than they actually answer.  I put together my thoughts and notes on it over in our discussion group. </p>

<p>{07/06/2007}: Release 1.1 now availableRelease 1.1 is now available. As usual, the source code is available in the repository, but you can also download the code and sample applications. </p>

<p>What&#39;s new in Release 1.1?In response to numerous questions about making the library easier to use, we&#39;ve added the JSONReflector class.  This class takes an instance of any object and using standard reflection routines, generates a JSON string.  There are some constraints on JSONReflector for the time being (it doesn&#39;t do anything with generics yet) but we&#39;ll take care of that later. </p>

<p>{07/02/2007}: Source and example apps available for zip downloadthe source code is available in the repository, but you can also download the code and sample applications in zip format.  For some, this may be easier than updating from the repository.  Those projects are current with source, but may not always be up to date. </p>

<p>Updated documentationwe have updated documentation as well as solution and project files for both the Windows .Net 2.0 Framework (Visual Studio 2005) and the Mono 2.0 Framework (Monodevelop).  You can find them over in source. </p>

 title : The juls Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Java on Gems sample application (Juls) README file</p>

<p>1. INTRODUCTION
<br/>Java on Gems (hereafter refererred to as Gems) is a framework extension for
<br/>the Google Widget Toolkit (GWT). This framework provides the key scaffoldings to
<br/>provide a methodical approach to accelerate the development of GWT applications.
<br/>However, learning how to use a framework via documentation is a painful and
<br/>highly unproductive exercise. The purpose of the Juls sub-project is to give
<br/>you context on how to build applications using Gems by example. I encourage you
<br/>to debug the juls project under an eclipse debugger to understand how the
<br/>framework operates.</p>

<p>1.1. JULS BACKGROUND
<br/>The Juls project is based on the Jump server that I conceived and have evolved
<br/>over the last six years. The Jump server is a java implementation of a dav subversion
<br/>servlet, webdav servlet and wiki servlet. When I attempted to port the UI to
<br/>Dojo in May &#39;06, I discovered the GWT toolkit and so began an new adventure for
<br/>me. Due to intellectual property issues, I am unable to share the entire Jump code
<br/>base at this point in time. However, I have gutted as much as of the codebase as I could
<br/>in order to show-case a large application built with GWT technology.</p>

<p>2. KNOWN ISSUES
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* Both FF-1.5.x and IE6.0.x appear to be unable to send multiple mutli-part
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;posts concurrently. It appears like once these browsers get into a large
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;upload state, they are unable to send any other asynchronous signals
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to the server. Interestingly all content gets uploaded, but the content is
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;unable to be picked up. If a new browser process is initiated then this
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;does not suffer this problem.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* Several irritating widget issues (see Gems README)</p>

<p>3. FEATURES
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* showcases most if not all Gems widgets (incl model and modeless forms)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* fish eye
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* list view
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* menu bar
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* bread crumb bar
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* http post form
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* pluggable service implementations
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* pluggable action implementation
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* pluggable page factories
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* a working mock server that sources data from the filesystem rather than svn
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* resource bundle access
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* multi file uploader with progress monitoring
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* Gems application that uses dynamic entry points for search engine friendly
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;content
<br/>&amp;nbsp;* some interesting inter-thread communication and coordination for fileupload
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and service pickup and handle
<br/>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>4. GETTING THE SOURCE
<br/># change directory to an appropriate place where you want Juls installed
<br/># svn co https://juls.googlecode.com/svn/trunk .</p>

<p>5. BUILDING
<br/># copy build.properties.template to build.properties.template
<br/># edit the file and modifiy the 3 last highlighted properties
<br/># edit the other files that are cited to point to your configuration
<br/># ant clean release</p>

<p>Notes, this used the gems-gwt-user distribution which includes the
<br/>GWTCompiler which is platform independent. This release target
<br/>will create new war file in the /dist/bin
<br/>directory. Tomcat is already configured to unpack the war from that
<br/>location so you dont need to move it.</p>

<p>6. DEBUGGING
<br/>There are three different eclipse launch configurations provided with
<br/>the Juls distribution. They are:
<br/># Juls-Client-Compiler.launch
<br/>Used to compile Juls in eclipse under a debugger with the gwt-user runtime.
<br/>(Ive used this in desperation to resolve a compiler issue, you just need to
<br/>know where to point your break points )</p>

<p># Juls-Server-5.5.9.launch
<br/>Used for debugging the server part of the application running in tomcat</p>

<p># Juls-Client-Shell.launch
<br/>Used for debugging the Gems/GWT client part of the application</p>

<p>Note, you cannot debug Juls in the traditional Gems hosted mode. The Juls
<br/>project takes advantage of the following from the JSP/servlet spec:
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* secured contexts
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* listeners
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* filters
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* servlets</p>

<p>Therefore you need to debug Juls in what I refer to as Semi-hosted model. Semi
<br/>because you can still debug the client using the GWT shell.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
<br/>7. RUNNING
<br/># Change to the /dist/jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/bin
<br/># catalina. start
<br/># open browser to http://localhost:8080/wiki/</p>

<p>Notes on ForkingThis product is relatively new, and while I can appreciate why you might want to fork code to your own repository such as GitHub, I would prefer it if patches were submitted upstream to this code base to help avoid fragmenting the product into multiple unfinished projects. Of course, the code is open source and you&#39;re free to fork it if you wish - however it&#39;d be nice to have a central repository that is as advanced and complete as possible. </p>

 summary : <p>Checkout the project home page for extended information (the link is to the right). </p>

<p>FeaturesSimple - Two static methods: VorbisIO.readComments and VorbisIO.writeComments. In-place Updates - Comment changes are written to the original file, not a copy of the file.  This means updates will be faster and the file attirbutes, such as permissions and creation time, will remain intact. Buffered Updates - A buffering scheme is employed to avoid re-writting the entire file when the comments are changed by only a small amount. Unicode - Full support for Unicode text. Tested - Many unit tests have been written in hopes of preventing file corruption.  I have executed this library on my 3500 file Ogg collection. Maintained - I am committed to maintaining this library.  Reported issues will be addressed in a timely manner.  Since this project has a very small and clearly defined scope, inactivity should be considered a good thing (many happy customers). Changesv1.0.1Includes workaround for the non-compliant iAudio U2 portable ogg player. Library jar should be a bit smaller because unit-tests are excluded. Converted unit tests from JUnit to TestNG v1.0.0First non-beta release! </p>

<p>Comment updating is faster than v0.5.0. Can now handle imperfect ogg files (recoverable corruption or minor non-conformance). Added documentation and examples.</p>

 summary : <p>Web application testing is still a nightmare. Doing simple test cases is a very time consuming task. Here we would like to propose a new approach for testing web applications, that focuses on the pragmatic approach to testing with randomized but controlled inputs instead of scripting. </p>

<p>First step will be to integrate our idea into JSF (Java Server Faces) framework, still providing the facilities to make this approach available for other frameworks. For more info look into documentation.</p>

 title : The jws-jpt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>项目简介　　J (java) W (web) S (studio)是一个集成、绿色、简洁的开发环境。JWS通过集成 maven2, ant, eclipse 使开发环境变成全绿色，甚至jdk都无需安装。这样开发团队就可以通过直接拷贝JWS实现开发环境的统一配置，缩短了项目的启动周期，方便了团队新成员的加入。由于JWS只是通过批处理使用所集成工具的核心功能，所以可看作是这些工具的最小组合，避免了由于安装大量插件造成IDE臃肿庞大、启动慢、配置复杂等问题。通过自定义maven插件实现的代码生成操作，灵活方便可扩展。JWS已经历3个内部稳定版本，支持Java代码的编译、打包、调试、执行等，目前只有WIN32下的批处理脚本，随后会增加LINUX下的。 </p>

<p>　　J (java&amp;javascript) P (project) T (template)是一个maven项目模板。通过优化组合Spring2, Struts2, IBATIS, Acegi Security, Freemarker, urlrewrite, JSON, JST, jQuery等优秀开源项目实现Web应用快速开发。通过模板生成的代码包含了基本的CRUD操作及客户端&amp;服务端校验，规范了什么代码应该写在哪里，一切基于简单约定，无需任何配置。 </p>

<p>　　可以下载 jws-jpt默认生成的mytest项目 快速预览jws-jpt效果，下载后解压 mytest.rar，在/src/main/webapp/下是静态页面，同时也是DEMO，浏览 index.html 可以看到生成的功能，静态页面展示的与实际启动了Web服务器的效果完全一致，区别只在于静态页面的数据是写在.json文件中模拟数据。分页功能是默认都有的，mytest中只有用户信息的模拟数据符合分页条件，所以静态页面中只有在用户管理中可以看到分页控制。Firefox下浏览静态页面会由于ajax的安全限制看不到效果，请使用IE6以上浏览器。注意不要阻止本地javascript的执行。 </p>

<p>JPT所能解决的开发问题 </p>

<p>客户端与服务端全解耦，使得静态DEMO挂上服务端就是实际系统，100%保证DEMO的完全重用，即最初的DEMO即是最终客户端，而模拟数据即是数据库设计的原型； Web与HTTP全解耦，使得更容易与非Web程序兼容； DAO与业务逻辑全解耦，真正体现D-A-O的实际职责。通过动态注入技术使得Service只在需要时才需添加； 完全意义的COC零配置，默认的配置几乎可以适用所有的逻辑，非常特殊的逻辑亦可单独配置； Freemarker与IBATIS的结合，简单而全面地封装了数据库差异，全面支持不同类型数据库，极大提高了SQL的重用程度； 类似REST的URL驱动的开发模式保证增加一个功能要做的只是“确定一个URL”，“写几个模型或叫VO类”，“写几个静态页面”，“写几条SQL语句”，而这些又都可以用自定义的maven插件从数据库或xml自动生成； 只需客户端技术和SQL技术即可完成绝大部分的应用逻辑，降低了对团队成员的技术要求，使任务更容易分配； 由数据库结构生成的默认代码，保证开发的规范性和代码结构的一致性； 只写真正需要的代码，全面平衡三层架构各层逻辑分布，去除各层之间传递性调用的尴尬； 优化组合spring2, struts2, ibatis, freemarker, acegi, urlrewite, json, jst, jquery等优秀开源技术，全面提高系统的兼容性和可扩展性； 默认实现了基于acegi security的用户管理，其中的资源缓存思想参考了springside，在此向其团队成员致敬。 外部依赖jws-jpt-full-all.rar 已上传，下载了完整版就可跳过安装步骤1,2,3,4,5,9了。
<br/>由于空间商的限制，最多允许8个线程同时在线，下载时请尽量少开线程。

 title : The kabqueue Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kaboose Queue (kabqueue)The Kaboose Queue system is designed to handle asynchronous generic tasks (or messages). The main function of this system is to take the load off the request cycle. We use this system to send out e-mail, perform intensive image or video tasks, asynchronous network operations, etc. </p>

<p>We had a few important things in mind when desiging this system: </p>

<p>Performance Scalibility Reliability </p>

<p>The first item is obvious. The system needs to be fast and relatively resource friendly. For this reason, we chose the Starling queue system from Twitter (www.twitter.com). </p>

<p>The second item, scalibility, means that the system should: </p>

<p>Be distributed. Many machines submitting tasks, and many machines processing these tasks. Handle a large number of requests. Each photo upload spawns resize operations for frequently used sizes. Each resize spawns off additional S3 uploads, for example. Support task priorities </p>

<p>The third item requires the system to handle failures, retry common errors, and notify us in case of major failures. Also, the system needs to surive the server dying and coming back and temporary network errors. </p>

<p>With the help of Starling, and our previous experience with a database-backed message queue system, I think we&#39;ve achieved our goals. We look forward to the community&#39;s feedback. </p>

<p>Requirements  sudo gem install starling
<br/>  sudo gem install daemons   </p>

<p>Installation  script/plugin install http://kabqueue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/kabqueueExample usageFirst, you will need to create a processor file(foo.rb) in RAILS_ROOT/app/processors folder. It should be structured like so: </p>

<p>class FooProcessor &lt; Kaboose::Processor 
<br/>processes :some_model 
<br/>def process 
<br/>some_model.some_method 
<br/>end 
<br/>end 
<br/>end 
<br/>Each processor class must implement a process method that defines the action that needs to be processed by the queue. This method has access to the @task instance variable that is an instance of Kaboose::Task. The processes macro creates an accessor method as a shortcut for accessing ActiveRecord models specified by model_id option in the task. See Kaboose::Processor&#39;s self.processes for more info. 	 </p>

<p>ConfigurationYou will need a kqueue.yml file in your apps config folder to specify the address and namespace of the system, for example: </p>

<p>  address: 127.0.0.1:22122
<br/>  namespace: some_namespace	 </p>

<p>Running the Kaboose Queue systemJust run ./script/queue_processor to get a list of options. </p>

<p>If you are using monit, here&#39;s what worked for us: </p>

<p>  check process queue-processor with pidfile /path/to/queue_processor.pid
<br/>    group qtp
<br/>    start program = &quot;PATH/queue_processor start -d -e production -c CWD -u USER -g GROUP&quot;
<br/>    stop program = &quot;PATH/queue_processor stop -d -e production -c CWD&quot;</p>

 summary : <p>Kanabuche is a very simple Ruby script to help learning Japanese kana characters, namely hiragana and katakana.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll need Unicode support and japanese fonts to display the kanas in your terminal and of course a Ruby interpreter.  </p>

<p>The script kanabuche.rb takes parameters to narrow the range of characters you want to practice, so that you can learn progressively. You can ask to work only on hiragana, using the -H switch, or only on katakana, using the -K switch. You can also specify a list of sounds that you want to practice.  </p>

<p>For example, to work only on hiragana characters containing the sounds &#39;k&#39; or &#39;o&#39;, you can invoke Kanabuche like this: </p>

<p>$ ruby kanabuche.rb -H k o
<br/>Welcome to Kanabuche!</p>

<p>Working on k and o. 31 questions.</p>

<p>Hiragana: け
<br/>  Romaji: 
<br/>[...]To specify that you want to work on the first row (a, i, u, e, o), pass the empty string! </p>

<p>$ ruby kanabuche.rb -K &#39;&#39; 
<br/>Welcome to Kanabuche!</p>

<p>Working on vowels. 5 questions.</p>

<p>Katakana: オ
<br/>  Romaji: o</p>

<p>As a bonus, you can also practice kanji characters for numbers if you pass the option -N. </p>

<p>$ ruby kanabuche.rb -N
<br/>Welcome to Kanabuche!</p>

<p>Working on all characters. 13 questions.</p>

<p>   Kanji: 一
<br/>  Digits: 1</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p>   Kanji: 七
<br/>  Digits: 2</p>

<p>No, 七 is 7.</p>

 title : The ken-cc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Highly portable C compiler suite, including supporting tools, originally developed for Plan 9 from Bell Labs and later also used for Inferno. </p>

<p>It targets 680x0, x86, amd64, SPARC, MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC. </p>

<p>It is small and fast.  It includes a stripped-down preprocessor. </p>

<p>Because all components are written portably, it is easy to use as a cross-compiler.  (On Plan 9 itself, a cross-compiler is made simply by compiling a target compiler with the host compiler.  There are no extra configuration files.) </p>

<p>The suite is pleasant to port, partly because the distribution of effort across the components is unusual. </p>

<p>The source code of the compiler suite is included in both Plan 9 and Inferno distributions, but this provides an independent source that might be used by other projects. </p>

<p>The project contains the source of the assemblers, compilers and loaders; supporting commands such as ar, nm, size etc.; the Acid debugger; supporting libraries; and the portable build environment, including mk.</p>

 summary : <p>KeplerCode  This project provides independent verification of  the computational aspects of two related proofs: </p>

<p>Thomas Hales&#39; proof of the Kepler conjecture Thomas Hales and Sean McLaughlin&#39;s proof of the Dodecahedral conjecture. </p>

<p>The two projects share most of their source code, so it is natural to have one repository for both.  The repository also also houses the technical details of the latter proof that could not be included in the published version because of space constraints.   The technical details and supporting documents for the Dodecahedral conjecture can  be found at http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~seanmcl/research/dodec.

 summary : <p>KeyczarKeyczar is an open source cryptographic toolkit designed to make it easier and safer for devlopers to use cryptography in their applications. Keyczar supports authentication and encryption with both symmetric and asymmetric keys. Some features of Keyczar include: </p>

<p>A simple API Key rotation and versioning Safe default algorithms, modes, and key lengths Automated generation of initialization vectors and ciphertext signatures Java, Python, and C++ implementations Why Keyczar?Cryptography is easy to get wrong. Developers can often choose the wrong cipher mode, use obsolete algorithms, compose primitives in an unsafe manner, or fail to anticipate the need for key rotation. Keyczar abstracts some of these details by choosing safe defaults, automatically tagging outputs with key version information, and providing a simple interface. </p>

<p>Keyczar is designed to be open, extensible, and cross-platform compatible. It is not intended to replace existing cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL, PyCrypto, or the Java JCE, and in fact is built on these libraries. </p>

<p>An illustrative use caseSuppose an application needs to encrypt a URL parameter value with a symmetric key. Normally, a developer would need to decide which algorithm to use, the key length to use, the mode of operation, how to handle initialization vectors, how to rotate keys, and how to sign ciphertexts. Keyczar simplifies these choices. Using an existing keyset, a Java developer would just need to call the following: </p>

<p>	Crypter crypter = new Crypter(&quot;/path/to/your/keys&quot;);
<br/>	String ciphertext = crypter.encrypt(&quot;Secret message&quot;);Similarly a Python developer would just call the following: </p>

<p>	crypter = Crypter.Read(&quot;/path/to/your/keys&quot;);
<br/>	ciphertext = crypter.Encrypt(&quot;Secret message&quot;);An example in C++: </p>

<p>        keyczar::Keyczar* crypter = keyczar::Encrypter::Read(location);
<br/>        if (!crypter) return 1;
<br/>        std::string ciphertext;
<br/>        bool result = crypter-&gt;Encrypt(input, &amp;ciphertext);For More InformationPlease see the design documents, JavaDocs, and PyDocs for more information. Keyczar&#39;s unit test cases are also good examples of typical usage. </p>

<p>CaveatsKeyczar sacrifices some flexibility in favor of safety and ease of use. Protecting developers from mistakes and handling details for them may also hide useful underlying features. Please see the NonGoals wiki page for a description of things that Keyczar is not. </p>

<p>DisclaimerKeyczar is very much beta software. The wire formats and key formats may change with later versions. Backward compatibility with early versions may not necessarily be maintained.</p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionVisit onebox for the &quot;one touch&quot; appliance-centric download and deployment guide Visit key word wiki for weighted key word information The current page provides a wiki about code, performance, implementation, and alternate downloads.  This svn may get updated before the above-mentioned builds See applications for interesting new applications of the keymatch, such as score optimization in Scrabble Baseline performance is between ten and a hundred times faster than a naive hash based approach.  The multi-threaded software achieves near linear speedup because the problem and solution are fully decomposable, </p>

<p>Runtimes on 1.5Ghz PowerBook G4 are shown in the table below.  For more performance figures see soup to nuts build and benchmark or ad-hoc timing results from the ManhattanMacStore.  Test data was generated from the Gutenberg index. </p>

<p>This is implemented as a lexicographically sorted simple sweet trie data structure and provides aggregation and all/longest/top/prefix matchers.  The software accepts serveral kinds of keymatches (see sample keymatches), and it aggregates multiple URL matches.  Matching can find all full matches, all prefix matches, or just the top (or longest) result.  Prefix matching is useful for exploratory analysis as well as typeahead web applications. </p>

<p>Custom Keymatch OneBoxThe Keymatch OneBox is a Java Servlet that mimics the built-in Keymatch functionality of the Google Search Appliance. If you&#39;ve outgrown built-in Keymatch, then you can take this OneBox and configure it to your specific needs. </p>

<p>This readme describes the simple steps needed to build and install this OneBox </p>

<p>System RequirementsThe following are required to build and run the Keymatch OneBox provider: </p>

<p>The OneBox Servlet Starter Kit project download A J2EE application server supporting servlets and JRE 1.4 or later, where you can deploy your OneBox JDK 1.4 or later, to build the Keymatch servlet and WAR file JDK 1.5 or later, to build the TrieKeymatch servlet and WAR file Ant version 1.6.2 or later, to run the build script Contents</p>

<p>file  description   readme.html  -- this file  keymatch.xml -- module definition file  Keymatch.java  -- provider servlet source code  keymatches  -- sample input file  TrieKeymatch.java  -- trie-based servlet plugin (optional)  trieMatch/  -- trie-based servlet source code (optional) </p>

<p>Building and InstallingTo get up and running with the Keymatch OneBox module just follow these simple steps: </p>

<p>Download the OneBox Servlet Starter Kit project distribution Expand the distribution and modify it as follows: Copy Keymatch.java into the onebox_servlet_starter_kit/src/ subdirectory Modify onebox_servlet_starter_kit/web.xml by adding the following just after the  element.  (Be sure to correctly set the keymatches file location and correctly point to your J2EE application server)

<br/>                    Keymatch
<br/>                    TrieKeymatch
<br/>                The TrieKeymatch is configurable to find all, longest, top or prefix matches. Duplicate URL matches are combined by the aggregation class specified in the aggregatorName servlet parameter See Customizing (below) for more information Rebuild onebox_servlet_starter_kit/onebox.war using the given onebox_servlet_starter_kit/build.xml Ant script. Deploy onebox_servlet_starter_kit/onebox.war to your J2EE application server. See your application server documentation on how to deploy a WAR. Modify the  element of the keymatch.xml module definition file to point to your J2EE application server. Install the keymatch.xml module definition file into your Google Search Appliance. See the documentation on how to install the OneBox module. You should now be able to run queries on the keywords in keymatches and see Keymatches in your search results. CustomizingModify the keymatches file to alter the keywords for which your OneBox shows Keymatches. The format of the file is one match per line, with each line taking the form of keyword,matchtype,URL,displaytitle. Possible matchtype values include ExactMatch, KeywordMatch, and PhraseMatch. For changes to this file to take effect, you&#39;ll need to reload(/restart/redeploy) the web application in your J2EE application server. </p>

<p>Modify the Keymatch.java Java Servlet to fundamentally change the behavior of the Keymatch OneBox. In this case the onebox.war file can then be rebuilt and redeployed to your application server. </p>

<p>Crank 1.0.1 Release Notes and Download </p>

<p>Crank Google Group for Questions and Such </p>

<p>Slides from Los Angeles JUG, 1/5/2008 </p>

<p>Crank is a master/detail, CRUD, and annotation driven validation framework built with JPA, JSF, Facelets and Ajax. It allows developers to quickly come up with JSF/Ajax based CRUD listings and Master/Detail forms from their JPA annotated Java objects. </p>

<p>Crank uses a lot of the new JSF features from Facelets, Ajax4JSF, etc. that will be used in JSF 2.0. Crank is a use case analysis of what is possible with the new JSF 2.0 stack. </p>

<p>The validation piece does server-side validation, Ajax validation or just emitted JavaScript validation based on Java annotations, property files, XML files, or database tables. Currently works with JSF, Spring MVC and Spring Webflow. </p>

<p>The framework is named Crank as in: &quot;crank out, to make or produce in a mass-production, effortless, or mechanical way: She&#39;s able to crank out one (CRUD listing) after another&quot;  and &quot;crank up: to get started or ready&quot;, &quot;to stimulate, activate, or produce&quot;, and most importantly &quot;to increase one&#39;s efforts, output, etc.: Industry began to crank up after the new (CRUD framework became our corporate standard).&quot; http://www.dictionary.com </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>The CRUD framework has support for JPA enabled DAO objects. The CRUD framework implements a Detached Criteria API/DSL similar to Hibernates (R) Criteria API except it works with JPA. The Detached Criteria API/DSL (DCAD) could be ported to other frameworks for example Hibernate, iBatis, etc. </p>

<p>The CRUD framework has a controller that is framework neutral as well. Currently there is an example the uses JSF to quickly create CRUD listings and master detail forms as follows: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>We built filterable listings in JSF/JPA. We plan on adding support for Struts 2 and Spring MVC that work with the CRUD listing (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Filter, and Sort). We did this before for an internal project called Presto (and before that with an internal framework based on Struts). This is like Presto revisted using Java annotations and generics (and a lot more eyeballs who provided a ton of feedback). </p>

<p>Here is an example of the filterable listing: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You can download the code from svn at https://krank.googlecode.com/svn/code/trunk. There is also a snapshot binary and src release in the download section. </p>

<p>To download the code do the following: </p>

<p>svn checkout https://krank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ crankTo learn more about Crank please read Crank Crud Intro. If you want to learn more about the design and philosphy of Crank please read Crank Crud Design documents. There is a getting started guide Getting Started With Crank for those who are new to JSF, and Facelets. Lasty, try reading our Wiki. </p>

<p>Please see the HomePage for more detail. </p>

<p>NewsJan, 2009: Cagatay Civici, world renown JSF expert, has joined the team as project owner and will be helping us port to JSF 2.0 as it becomes available. Jan, 2009: Codegen Alpha has been released. Soon it will be faster than ever to create a new project with Crank! Nov, 2008: Major pom cleanups, poms reviewed with maven expert and revamped, 1.0.1 released, fixed broken examples, upgraded to Spring 2.5.5 from 2.0.6.  Oct, 2008: 1.0 released May, 2008: Overhauled Pagination. Optimized to only hit Database after next, previous, etc. is hit (once and only once). Much more efficient. April, 2008: Went through several iterations of patches as we prepare to launch 10+ applications built on top of Crank March, 2008: Improved event management Feb 1, 2008: Sean Burns integrated Crank with Seam see Crank and Seam, Injecting from Spring into Seam Jan 09, 2008: Paul Hixson and I got rid of the dreaded &quot;need to hit update button twice issue&quot;. PISFA. Jan 03, 2008: Tom Cellucci has been making a lot of updates so we did a new release Snapshot 013. Nov 11th, 2007: Tom Cellucci added support to GenericDao and implementations for operations on multiple entities  Apparently there are some people in the world that can&#39;t download a ppt viewer for them Bill created this: http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dd5hj3c9_1fdzpd8  Nov 7th, 2007: Presentation on getting started with Crank. It should take about an hour or less to go through this presentation and build your first crank project. http://krank.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ppts/Crank-Slidess.ppt  Oct 30th, 2007: Added missing support for I18n Oct 30th, 2007: Added support for filtering by enum.

(8/23/2007) Chris Mathias added second level cache preload and integration support PreloadableCacheableGenericDao (8/23/2007) -- see design docs.  August 21st, 2007: Rick created design documents for the controller architecture see Crank Crud Design documents August 19th, 2007: Chris Mathias authored a version of the base dao support which divorces us from Spring&#39;s JpaDaoSupport, making EJB integration possible. We have a guy with Seam/EJB3 experience who has volunteered to port one of the example apps to Seam/EJB3 stack. August 19th, 2007: Scott Fauerbach of Presto fame joins the group. Scott worked on Presto which is a similar framework (much more mature than Crank) August 16th, 2007: Paul Tabor Added Enum support. Now Enums show up in forms. Sorting and Filtering Enums is in progress. August 16th, 2007: Rick Hightower added support for editing and sorting on composite relationships, i.e., employee.address.line1 can be edited in the form, and it is sortable/filterable from the listing.

 summary : <p>Krok is functionally similar to many other JavaScript libraries, such as JQuery and Prototype. In fact it borrows heavily from Prototype (including reusing the Rake build scripts and eventually the unit testing ideas).</p>

<p>The most distinguishing feature of this library is that it is built using some of the advanced JavaScript techniques outlined by Douglas Crockford. As a result, the approach to a number of problems is significantly different. I have also decided not to implement features I don&#39;t think are particularly useful for advanced developers, such as the Ruby-style Iterators.</p>

<p>KTUIKit Interface Builder PluginLayout Inspector </p>

<p>Enhancements: </p>

<p>Multiple selection working for all values Added auto alignment, placement Can edit the margin values inside the resizing control Live resizing works properly now - the resizing doesn&#39;t lag and mess up the layout. You can switch off the live resizing while you&#39;re laying out (this is a global property, applies to all the views, not just the inspected view). Bugs: </p>

<p>Auto alignment and placement not yet using &quot;IBInset&quot; values or &quot;baseline&quot; values, so controls like the default aqua button aren&#39;t aligned/placed as expected. Flipped coordinate systems are not accounted for in KTLayoutManager - the calculations are always from the bottom/left of the superview Style Inspector </p>

<p>Enhancements:    Multiple selection working for all values </p>

<p>To Do: </p>

<p>Add ability to set background image The layout and overall design of the style inspector still sucks. Color picker interaction - especially with the gradient control - still sucks. General Plugin Issues: </p>

<p>To Do: </p>

<p>Proper icons for the Library objects Proper styling for the Gradient Picker control </p>

<p>KTUIKit FrameworkWindow ControllersEnhancements and Changes: </p>

<p>Commented out the code that tells view controllers to &quot;removeObservations&quot; in &quot;windowWillClose:&quot;.  It is now totally up to the surrounding application architecture to coordinate this message being sent though the controller hierarchy. View ControllersEnhancements and Changes: </p>

<p>Added a &quot;hidden&quot; property to KTViewController - if a view controller is flagged as hidden, it is removed from the responder chain and vice versa.  However,  if the view controller is observing anything or bound to anything, those connections remain while the view is hidden until a good solution is found. NOTE: this hidden property has absolutely no relationship to NSView&#39;s &quot;hidden&quot; property.  When a view controller is hidden, it&#39;s view is not removed from the view hierarchy or set to hidden.  I&#39;m very hesitant to make such a direct connection between the view controller hierarchy and the actual view hierarchy.   API changes Changed language so that it uses the term &quot;subcontrollers&quot; instead of &quot;child&quot;.  For example, -addSubcontroller: instead of -addChild: Removed the indexed accessors so that dealing with the view controller hierarchy is more like the view hierarchy.  There is no longer a &quot;Parent&quot; ivar.  I absolutely want to discourage traversing the view controller hierarchy to access view controllers - this makes for bad application architecture. Added list of &quot;layer controllers&quot; and addLayerController:/removeLayerController: methods, which ties KTLayerController into the current controller system.  KTTabViewControllerAdded KTTabViewController class.  It&#39;s still in a very experimental phase. The tab view controller is designed with a similar API as an NSTabView There are tab items (KTTabItem) for each view controller you want to switch between Adding tabs means creating a tab item and adding it to the tab view controller The tab items are kept in an NSArrayController property of the tab view controller.  The goal of this is to allow a tab view controller&#39;s array controller of tab items to be bound to standard controls like a pop up button (through normal NSPopUpButton/NSArrayController bindings) or a custom tab view that you create.  NOTE: This model of tabbing views with view controllers is not compatible with NSTabView, don&#39;t try to use an NSTabView with a tab view controller. Selecting a view controller means that the previous selection&#39;s view is removed from the view controller&#39;s view and the new view controller&#39;s view is added.  In an application, you&#39;d just add the tab view controller&#39;s view to the view hierarchy and select tab items to see the views switch. When view controllers are selected/deselected the view controllers are properly added/removed from the responder chain using KTViewController&#39;s new &quot;hidden&quot; property.  For now, bindings/observations remain for view controllers that aren&#39;t selected. The whole workflow is still a little clunky, but I&#39;m working it out as I&#39;m using it in an application right now.... Layer ControllersKTLayerController is a controller for &quot;layers&quot;, which are typed id.  They can be used with CALayers - or any other class that you have with a similar concept. KTLayerController works seamlessly with the current controller design, you can start to build a hierarchy of layers by adding a &quot;layer controller&quot; to KTViewController&#39;s list of layer controllers in the same way that a view controller hierarchy begins by adding &quot;view controllers&quot; to KTWindowController&#39;s list of view controllers. KTLayerControllers are added to the responder chain and have a -removeObservations method just like KTViewControllers. KTLayerControllers maintain a weak refrerence to the hosting view controller just like the view controller holds a reference to its hosting window controller. KTLayerController has a &quot;representedObject&quot; property. KTLayerController has a &quot;layer&quot; property that is analogous to NSViewController&#39;s &quot;view&quot; property. KTViewEnhancements and Changes: </p>

<p>To lesson the need to subclass views for simple configurations, added ability to set properties for: opaque mouseDownCanMoveWindow canBecomeKeyView canBecomeFirstResponder Moved the code that triggers KTLayoutManager auto-layout of subviews to &quot;setFrameSize:&quot; instead of &quot;setFrame:&quot; Bugs: </p>

<p>The ability to tell Cocoa that a mouse down in a view can move a window doesn&#39;t seem to work with a hierarchy of KTViews. KTStyleManagerEnhancements and Changes: </p>

<p>Optimizations: Most of the drawing code now checks the &quot;dirty rect&quot; to determine if it needs to draw styles, can still be optimized further. When a background color is set, style manager checks the opacity and if the background is opaque, it sets the view to be opaque. To Do: </p>

<p>Add ability to configure styles for different view/window key states KTSplitViewAdded a custom split view class.  The IB plugin is not ready to release yet.  Documentation on this class will come in a future update.

 summary : <p>IntroductionThe basic idea behind this project is to develop new Klooge DEFs and improve existing ones.  The end goal is to enrich the Klooge community through capable DEF support for a broad range of RPGs. </p>

<p>We intend to release our work to the KW community without restrictions or limitations except that any derivatives of our work remain open and free. </p>

<p>Aims and AssumptionsKlooge is possibly the most powerful and configurable digital tabletop out there, but the flip side is the complexity of configuration. Despite this limitation, Klooge is extremely worthwhile, especially for those who use RPG systems not served by other digital tabletops or those who want to customize the tabletop experience.</p>

 summary : <p>Lagniappe simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-⋆ architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification—expressed using a model-driven development framework—of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-⋆ platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.</p>

<p>lambda-tube is a simple application to search and download videos from youtube. It is written in PLT Scheme, and developed using the DrScheme programming environment. </p>

<p>I have always felt the need for an application which could search and download (in one go) a list of youtube videos without having to visit the website. Earlier I would use the youtube.com search, get the urls into a text file, and then write a script to call youtube-dl to download each of them one-by-one. This is time-taking, and I thought this could be simplified. </p>

<p>lambda-tube is an effort in this direction.  </p>

 title : The lammy Open Source Project on Open Hub

<p>Anyway, nothing revolutionary, just the bare-bones of a front end system... There&#39;s no template system to speak of, but there are nice little things like intelligent ways to include functions per section of your site, and I&#39;ve kind of emulated Ruby on Rails&#39;s flash thing for error notifications and that... </p>

<p>Documentation will be written when Lammy is done, and there&#39;s no telling when that might be, but in the meantime take a look and you should be able to figure it out for yourself... It&#39;s nothing really all that sophisticated... </p>

<p>Oh wait, you can&#39;t yet, I haven&#39;t done anything about the installer... You need a MySQL database you see, so I&#39;ll need to code it to populate the relevant data before you can properly use it... </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get on that one of these days... Hold on, yeah?</p>
 title : The lams-ah-cj Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The telecommunications industry is shifting its focus away from traditional fixed networks and into mobile and broadband telephony. The broadband market is currently small but growing at rapid pace due to widespread broadband access and competitive pricing. It is predicted that this growth will continue and broadband will become a mainstream telephony medium.  </p>

<p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is the standard protocol for transmitting voice over  broadband networks. VoIP has specific monitoring and management needs. As a real time  application its network needs are more demanding than data, latency, packet loss and delay must be carefully managed to provide acceptable QoS. Additionally telephony has many metrics and features which need to be conveyed effectively and efficiently. The telephony service and the underlying network must be managed side by side.  </p>

<p>Current VoIP management solutions are generally propriety and require administrators to  have specific knowledge of VoIP technologies. Most solutions condense information into  tables and 2D graphs. We have recognised a gap in the market for a management tool which  has high usability and communicates large volumes of complex data efficiently and effectively. Research has suggested that representing information in a visual 3D format is useful in certain scenarios. We aim to investigate this usefulness for VoIP management.  </p>

<p>We propose to develop a unique monitoring and management system for VoIP called  LAMS. LAMS will generate a 3D virtual world which reflects in real time an operational VoIP telephony system. Objects and concepts in the telephony system will be represented by objects in the virtual world. Telephony and network metrics will be mapped to visual  characteristics of the virtual objects. For example the bandwidth being consumed by a VoIP server may be communicated through the colour of its virtual counter-part. In this way critical information is communicated to the user instantly. LAMS users will be immersed in the fully interactive virtual world. Actions performed on the virtual objects will invoke actions on the real world system.  </p>

<p>We will create a working prototype of LAMS which will monitor a small IP PBX under lab  conditions. A subset of critical network and telephony metrics will be represented in the  prototype, and a few main management tasks may be executed.  </p>

<p>LAMS will use L3DGEWorld, an open source 3D visualisation utility to create the virtual  environment. Our test IP-PBX which LAMS will manage will be created through minimum specification hardware and open source telephony package Asterisk. We will write scripts  which extract data from Asterisk servers and convert it into a format L3DGEWorld display. We  will create 3D models and maps which best represent the telephony servers and the context  of the telephony network.  The role of the prototype is to demonstrate the potential of LAMS as a monitoring and  management system for VoIP. We will investigate the prototype for its effectiveness and  efficiency in monitoring VoIP and its impact on the telephony network.</p>

<p>Mouse input (simulated click at the calculated position) Keyboard input (simulate keypress if laser is inside a predefined area) TCP/IP (send coordinates over network, to use it otherwise) launch program (launch program, with or without coordinates) laserTraq uses gStreamer so any gStreamer-supported device should work. One can define multiple &quot;sources&quot; (so you can use more than one camera at a time) and multiple &quot;sensors&quot; per source. (to use i.e. more than one mousepointers/different laser colors or define multiple areas, each with different keycodes to simulate or programs to launch). </p>

 title : The lastfm-as3 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an Actionscript 3.0 API to access all the available Last.fm web services. This should hopefully save some people time from doing all the grunt work of parsing feeds and sorting through all that lovely data that Last.fm provides. It is currently a work in progress so not all the services are currently available. The packages are divided similar to the audioscrobbler services page: http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/ (UserData, ArtistData, etc). Documentation is also an important goal of this project so keep an eye on the ever-growing wiki. These packages can be used in Adobe Flex, AIR, or Flash applications. </p>

<p>Update 09-15-2007: Completed wiki for all User Data services. Also reworked some code / events in the Session class and update it&#39;s wiki page. </p>

<p>Update 09-12-2007: Added all services for retrieving user information from the Last.fm services. These include: </p>

<p>Profile Information Top Artists Top Albums Top Tracks Top Tags Top Tags for Artist Top Tags for Album Top Tags for Track Friends List Neighbours Recent Tracks Recent Banned Tracks Recent Loved Tracks Recent Journals Weekly Chart List Weekly Artists Chart Weekly Albums Chart Weekly Tracks Chart Manual Recommendations System Recommendations User Events / Friends&#39; Events / System Event Recommendations Taste-O-Meter  </p>

 summary : <p>Ever feel that Last.fm&#39;s web/Flash interface and desktop app take up too much memory and screen space? Do you have a fetish for the austere glow of ASCII characters against a dark void? Then lastfm-cli might be for you.  </p>

<p>lastfm-cli is an interactive command-line &amp; telnet interface to a last.fm account and last.fm audio streams.  </p>

<p>lastfm-cli lets you choose radio stations, play songs, skip songs, &quot;love&quot; them or &quot;ban&quot; them, and control the volume without touching a mouse. Moreover, via telnet, you can share control of a last.fm audio stream (playing through the office or home sound system, for instance) as long as the computer running lastfm-cli is accessible on the local network.  </p>

<p>lastfm-cli requires an mp3 stream player. Currently, only iTunes is supported, but support for linux players such as MPG123 is under development.  </p>

<p>Warning: This is alpha, so the code is messy and it doesn&#39;t always recover gracefully from errors. Plus Last.fm streams are sketchy at times, so please don&#39;t expect skipping and switching radio stations to be completely fast or reliable. </p>

<p>author: Daniel Choi, member of the Betahouse web cooperative in Cambridge, MA </p>

<p>Screenshot </p>

<p>RequirementsCurrently, lastfm-cli requires OS X Leopard. But I am working to make it work on Linux.  </p>

<p>Streaming Last.fm to AirtunesSince lastfm-cli uses iTunes to play the Last.fm audio stream, you can stream Last.fm via lastfm-cli to an Airport Express. But streaming radio via iTunes to Airport Express isn&#39;t the most stable experience and you may experience frequent dropouts. To minimize dropouts, try increasing the streaming buffer size to the maximum in iTunes preferences. </p>

<p>A production-quality product like Airfoil may serve better for this purpose. </p>

<p>Installationlastfm-cli is a ruby gem hosted on Rubyforge. You can install it with this command: </p>

<p>&gt; sudo gem install lastfm-cli </p>

<p>After a successful installation, you should be able to run lastfm-cli with this command: </p>

<p>&gt; lastfm-cli </p>

<p>Enjoy. Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome.</p>

 summary : <p>LaTeX Lab is an open source implementation of a web based LaTeX editor for Google Docs. </p>

<p>Integration with Google Docs is achieved via GData API. The application is developed using GWT and hosted on the Google AppEngine. A CLSI implementation provides the link to the LaTeX compiler. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in beta testing an early LaTeX Lab implementation contact one of the project members. </p>

<p>The following are some screenshots of the current state:</p>

 title : The latex-makefile Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a single GNU makefile that builds a LaTeX document into various targets with minimal latex/bibtex invocations.  It colorizes and swallows the normally unhelpful latex output so that errors and other important messages are easy to spot.  It handles GNUplot, Fig, and Dot image creation (and handles many more formats besides), and does automatic dependency tracking. </p>

<p>Perhaps most important, it is convenient because it is a single file and only depends on standard Unix utilities that are likely to exist on any system.  It includes built-in help documentation and various utilities to test whether it will work on your system. </p>

<p>NEW!The makefile now supports pdflatex natively, as of version 2.2.0.  Please use the issue tracker to submit bugs. </p>

<p>Old behavior is obtainable by setting the BUILD_STRATEGY=latex variable in Makefile.ini.</p>

 title : The layeredcontent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Layered Content is a usable, open source, web content management system. Layered Content&#39;s overarching goal is to ensure an easy and user friendly system to manage websites. Features will be added, but never at the expense of the easiness to learn and use the system. </p>

<p>Layered Content is built on PHP and MySQL on the server-side and Adobe&#39;s Flex and AIR technologies on the client-side. </p>

<p>IRC is #layeredcontent on freenode.net </p>

<p>Mailing list is http://groups.google.com/group/layeredcontent </p>

<p>The Start of Layered ContentThis is the starting of a new web content management system. It is the one we&#39;ve all wished someone would make. No one is making it for us, so we are taking it upon ourselves to create it. The main goals are quite simple and should direct every decision. They are, in order of importance: </p>

<p>Ease of use for the User -- We want to be able to make sites for ourselves, clients, friends, and family that they&#39;ll be able to keep up on their own. </p>

<p>Ease of use for the Designer -- We want easy templating and no/little knowledge of PHP to create templates (not at the expense of learning a new complex templating language either). </p>

<p>Ease of use for the Developer -- We want to be able to customize, add plugins, and modify the site to accommodate needed site features. </p>

<p>More Details on Layered ContentLayered Content is released under the MIT license. It uses the Zend Framework (New BSD license) and Flex framework (MPL license). The following is a list of initial thoughts and ideas that have accumulated up to this point and which are still subject to change. The system described in these pages is rather simple but flexible. It may not allow for all the eventual features Layered Content will want to support. </p>

<p>Unique Paradigm for dealing with content and display Layering Content is shared across pages and revisions Nice URLs allow for better search engine optimization Page Caching ensures higher performance Simple Templating which should allow any developer familiar with HTML to create templates Layered Permissions allow less maintenance for user permissions while still allowing robustness Extensions will allow extensibility without hacking the core site code The Layered Content [Roadmap] shows what has been done and what needs to be done. This of course will change as the project changes. Remember, everything is open to discussion and change. </p>

<p>UI ScreenshotsThese don&#39;t have working data in them so they look a little empty, but we&#39;re throwing them up quickly for those who have good imaginations. </p>

 title : The legendtv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project aims to create an alternative to MythTV for Linux-based machines. The project will utilize the already-proven capabilities of the VLC project for video decoding and playback, and combine them with the proven networking and database capabilities of Java to create a stable, portable PVR application that should (hopefully) be available for Windows and OS X in the not-too-distant future. </p>

<p>As with MythTV, LegendTV will separate the PVR system into a presentation tier (front-end), which handles playback via a Swing or Java3D-based GUI (user preference), and an application tier (back-end), which handles scheduling, recording, and file management. This will allow multiple front-end machines to utilize a single back-end, multiple back-ends to be managed by a single front-end, or any combination of the two. One of the most important goals of the project is to ensure high usability, high reliability, and excellent performance/responsiveness. </p>

<p>The user interface and a large portion of the application tier will be implemented during the Fall quarter of 2008 as part of a class project for 4010-444 - Engineering Methods of Software Usability, a Software Engineering course at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>

 title : The libconcurrency Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Concurrency in CA lightweight concurrency library for C, featuring symmetric coroutines as the main control flow abstraction. The library is similar to State Threads, but using coroutines instead of green threads. This simplifies inter-procedural calls and largely eliminates the need for mutexes and semaphores for signaling. </p>

<p>Eventually, coroutine calls will also be able to safely migrate between kernel threads, so the achievable scalability is consequently much higher than State Threads, which is purposely single-threaded. </p>

<p>This library was inspired by Douglas W. Jones&#39; &quot;minimal user-level thread package&quot;. The pseudo-platform-neutral probing algorithm on the svn trunk is derived from his code. </p>

<p>There is also a safer, more portable coroutine implementation based on stack copying, which was inspired by sigfpe&#39;s page on portable continuations in C. Copying is more portable and flexible than stack switching, and making copying competitive with switching is being researched. </p>

<p>CoroutinesCoroutine calls consist of only one operation: coro_call. This operation suspends the currently executing coroutine, and resumes the target coroutine passing it a given value. Passing a value in the other direction is exactly the same. Coroutines which use only one operation like this are called symmetric coroutines. </p>

<p>Asymmetric coroutines use two different operations, like call and yield, implying that one caller is subordinate to another. Lua supports asymmetric coroutines. </p>

<p>In many ways, such coroutines closely resemble the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) facilities of microkernel operating systems like EROS, and they are also closely related to actors. </p>

<p>Revisiting Coroutines is a detailed paper explaining the advantages of coroutines as a control flow abstraction. While the authors prefer asymmetric coroutines, and use a coroutine label to avoid capture problems, I think it&#39;s simpler to simply use the coroutine reference itself in place of a label. </p>

<p>Comparison to Existing AlternativesFeatures libconcurrency provides that are not found in libcoro, libCoroutine, libpcl, coro: </p>

<p>Cloning a coroutine: this enables a straightforward implementation of multishot continuations. Without the ability to clone, only one-shot continuations can be implemented in terms of coroutines. Note, cloning is not available on Windows since Windows uses the Fibers API. This was necessary to handle some unfortunate problems. The more portable stack copying implementation does support cloning. Portable Speed: libconcurrency is based on a portable technique that modifies jmp_buf and uses setjmp/longjmp to save and restore contexts. This is fast because setjmp/longjmp do not save and restore signals, whereas most other libraries are based on ucontext, which is very portable but inefficient, or assembler which is efficient but not portable. The library consists of entirely C99 compliant C and no exotic platform or OS features are used. Actual coroutine API: most of the listed libraries implement green threads, not coroutines. You&#39;ll note that no values are passed between coroutines in these libraries. Passing values between coroutines is one of the primary reasons why they are more general than threads. Simpler API: the API consists of only 6 orthogonal functions: coro_init, coro_call, coro_clone, coro_poll, coro_free. Works on Windows: libconcurrency is primarily developed on Windows, and uses Windows Fibers for coroutines. Resources are managed: the coro_poll function must be called periodically to ensure a coroutine has enough resources to continue executing. This function can shrink or grow the stack using a hysteresis algorithm inspired by the description of one-shot continuations in Representing Control in the Presence of One-Shot Continuations. </p>

<br/>	if (r.c != &#39;\n&#39;) {
<br/>		coro_call(cw, r);
<br/>	}
<br/>  }
<br/>}</p>

<p>void writer(cvalue w) {
<br/>  while(1) {
<br/>    printf(&quot; echo: %c\n&quot;, w.c);

 title : The libkate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kate is an overlay codec, originally designed for karaoke and text, that can be multiplixed in Ogg. Text and images can be carried by a Kate stream, and animated. Most of the time, this would be multiplexed with audio/video to carry subtitles, song lyrics (with or without karaoke data), etc, but doesn&#39;t have to be. </p>

<p>Series of curves (splines, segments, etc) may be attached to various properties (text position, font size, etc) to create animated overlays. This allows scrolling or fading text to be defined. This can even be used to draw arbitrary shapes, so hand drawing can also be represented by a Kate stream.  </p>

 title : The libset Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library is a thin c# wrapper around BSD licensed libtcod (http://doryen.eptalys.net/). It provides a cross platform graphics and roguelike library to those who wish to program in c#. </p>

<p>This library is fully developed and API stability is expected to be similar to libtcod itself. The only major missing sections of the API are heightmap and sub-cell image blitting.  </p>

<p>This update brings support up to the latest release (1.5.0rc1). This update breaks API compatibility with the previous releases due to changes in the underlying API. The most obvious break is with pathfinding. TCODPathFinding is now broken up into TCODAStrPathFinding and TCODDijkstraPathFinding. </p>

<p>The new 1.5.0rc1-2 fixes issues with TCODRandom. All users of 1.5.0rc1 are strongly encouraged to update.</p>

 title : The lifeyears Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The ultimate goal of the LifeYears Initiative is to inspire, inform and empower normal citizens to have a substantial, measurable impact on the most serious social issues in the world. </p>

<p>Our immediate aim is to use the so-called &quot;Web 2.0&quot; technologies to remove or bypass the obstacles that prevent people from contributing to charity. More concretely, we are creating a simple, simple system that gives people  </p>

<p>Accounts to measure how many lifeyears they themselves have saved through their individual contributions Multiple, simple ways to make contributions: E.g.,  &quot;Subscribing&quot; to saving 5 lifeyears a week,  making one-off purchases (E.g., &quot;current cost of a lifeyear: $0.56),  giving away lifeyears (&quot;take your giftcode online to have your lifeyears gift entered into your account&quot;)  Credible and clear information about each financed project. E.g.,  links to the large, credible aid organizations that run the specific projects budget breakdowns  description of the health challenges addressed and the concrete measures to be taken, youtube video field reports,  email addresses and links to organizations and project participants Ways to inform others of the system (and their own individual contribution) E.g., plugins to facebook,  banners for your personal homepage or blog,  competitions to create the most successful viral video on youtube,  ways to compare groups you belong to versus others (your contribution versus those from your own country versus those in other countries, or comparisons by age, school, etc.,  e-postcards,  T-shirts </p>

<p>In this way we kill the objections that stop people from contribution, such as </p>

<p>&quot;Too many good causes and good organizations... I can&#39;t choose...&quot; Instead, we provide one metric (lifeyears) and a way to finance projects from many serious, credible aid organizations &quot;I&#39;ve heard most of the money never reaches those who need it...&quot; Instead, we provide clear breakdowns of budgets and an opportunity to check &quot;how it went&quot; as time goes by &quot;My contribution would be too small to matter anyway...&quot; Instead, your contribution is measured in a clearly important unit, and you know exactly how much it will cost you (e.g. $0.56) to save one more lifeyear &quot;I gave yesterday, so I don&#39;t need to give today...&quot; Instead, your contribution is cumulative, you can compare your total contribution to friends, people of your own age, from your own country etc. We make it clear that contributing more achieves more.</p>

 title : The lightdatamodel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A light OR mapper for .Net. </p>

<p>This is an alternative to Object Mappers such as NPersist or NHibernate (or the built-in typed DataSets in Visual Studio). Unlike the mentioned libraries, the focus on this project is to keep it as simple as possible (and more flexible than the typed DataSets). </p>

<p>We have worked with the existing Object Mappers for a while, and found that the items we want to model, usually has small deviations from the simple model. This makes it difficult to use the mappers, and requires some heavy manual coding. The complexity of the projects makes this a non-trivial task. The LightDataModel project seeks to remove the complexity. </p>

<p>As with all Object Mappers, the idea is to create typed C# classes as representation for database data, and remove the database problems from the programming. The methods usually involved in this is named CRUD: Create, Retrive, Update and Delete. </p>

<p>As this project focuses on simplicity, there is no Aspect oriented programming involved. There are no options to configure, and the project simply reads data from the database, and updates the private member variables with the data value. The naming scheme is fixed, and so is the access method. This reduction in flexibility makes the project much more simple. We feel that the removed options are rarely used, and can be fixed by some extra code. </p>

<p>The basic structure is this: </p>

<p>IDataProvider (executes SQL against a datasource, database dependant) IDataFetcher (registers and loads objects from an IDataProvider) DataClassBase (base class for database bound objects (optional)) </p>

<p>The data fetcher can use any .Net object (POCO: Plain-Old-Clr-Object), and will read/write private members of the given objects. If the objects derive from DataClassBase, some events and flags will be activated. </p>

<p>If you are just starting out with the LightDataModel, you should see the page on Automatic Project Creation. </p>

<p>If you want to do the class creation manually, please look at Building Classes. </p>

<p>On top of the basic CRUD implementations a usual requirement is a &quot;memory-transaction&quot; aka a nested provider. This is most commonly used in GUI development, where the user presses a button and recieves a dialog. In this dialog, the data should reflect the current memory state of the data, and if the user clicks cancel, the changes should be rolled back. We do this with the class NestedDataFetcher: </p>

<p>IDataProvider provider = new SQLiteDataProvider(&quot;myfile.sqlite3&quot;);
<br/>IDataFetcher fetcher = new DataFetcher(provider);
<br/>IDataFetcher nestedFetcher = new NestedDataFetcher(fetcher);Any objects loaded in the nestedFetcher will appear as they are in the fetcher, and data from nestedFetcher will only be written back on a call to the commit method. </p>

<p>In this model, class names map to table names, and field names map to column names. There is no built in relation management, but it is very easy to implement this manually: </p>

<p>//One to one, or Many-to-one
<br/>public ClassA Other
<br/>{
<br/>    get { return (ClassA)m_dataparent.GetObjectById(typeof(ClassA), m_otherid); }
<br/>    set { if (value == null) m_otherid = 0; else m_otherid = value.ID; }
<br/>}
<br/>//One to many
<br/>public object[] Others
<br/>{
<br/>    get { return m_dataparent.GetObjects(typeof(ClassA), &quot;otherID = &quot; + m_otherId.ToString()); }
<br/>}A little extra is required to manage collections with Add/Remove methods. An abstract template class for this is in the making. A many-to-many relation can be created by implementing two one-to-may relations on the cross table. </p>

<p>To be truly usefull, the LightDataModel comes with a primitive SQL parser. </p>

<p>An introduction to more advanced usage of the parser can be found on the Using SQL parser with values page. </p>

<p>There are many limitiations, but we feel that they can be overridden in the individual projects, and thus avoid complicating the object mapper: </p>

<p>Class names are used as table names, thus table names with spaces are not allowed Override the tablename by using a simple view Member values names are always the column name prefixed with &quot;m_&quot; Adjust acessor code to use these values, or create views to rename columns No shadowed properties (aka. delay load or ghosted) Split the class into two, use a view to exclude the properties, and add acessor code that loads this Supports only single column identity tables Combine columns in a view </p>

<p>If you want a complex engine that handles all the above limitiations and has a nice GUI editor, we suggest NPersist. </p>

<p>Beware: The LightDatamodel is functional, but not tested enough to be publishable.</p>

<p>LimberBending Flex to Rails. </p>

<p>What Does It Do?This Rails plugin provides a two-stage active code generator for Adobe Flex applications which interact with a Rails  resource on the back end.  The input to the generator is a Ruby DSL along with a number of helpers (behaviors and components) to help keep your code dry. </p>

<p>This allows Ruby developers to utilize the full UI widget library for Flex to develop Rich Internet Applications with relatively few lines of Ruby.  It provides generators and rake tasks to produce the entire application using the Cairngorm framework.  I tried to remain faithful to the general ideas contained in the example application in the Flexible Rails book, however, having produced one entire production application this way, I am thinking about refactoring and possibly generating code using a different framework. </p>

<p>There should be no need to modify the generated code except in some cases where you may wish to test or debug something.  As such, it is an &quot;active&quot; code generator.  You only maintain Ruby code. </p>

<p>You may include arbitrary ActionScript where needed, however, when you find yourself dropping into ActionScript more than once for the same type of thing, it is advisable to extend Limber by adding a Behavior or a Component.  (The names for these abstractions may change.) </p>

<p>So far I have developed a couple components such as: </p>

<p>form_for data_grid_for create_or_update_buttons_for and so on.  These are really more analogous to Rails helpers so I am a little unhappy overloading the term &quot;component.&quot; </p>

<p>Behaviors include: </p>

<p>for_each create update destroy reorder alert filter_on_boolean_value format_currency format_date and more... </p>

<br/>        }
<br/>      end
<br/>    }
<br/>  endAs you can see, some ActionScript is required but I have tried to make it as minimal as possible. </p>

<p>Why?The impetus for development of this plugin came in the form a consulting project.  I was contacted about an application using Ruby on Rails and Flex which had been in development for quite some time and was way behind schedule.  They were seeking to on-shore the development and get the project into production in six weeks. </p>

<p>I did not know Flex but I was intrigued and immediately began to review the Flexible Rails example application and related Flex documentation.   In the end, I was able to rewrite the entire application from scratch, replacing 30,000 lines of hand coded MXML and ActionScript with about 3000 lines of ruby, including a minimal amount of ActionScript.  This seemed to me to be a far more maintainable code base.  I was able to do this in two months, while developing the plugin.  I am convinced the value of Code Generation cannot be underestimated.  Furthermore, Ruby is a fantastic language for writing code generators. </p>

<p>Under Active DevelopmentThis code is under active development and may not work.  There are parts which are not yet included.  Documentation is so far, non-existent, however, you are welcome to take a peek. </p>

<p>Known IssuesI know there are places where I am not doing things the best way and have been sloppy.  There is cruft that needs to be removed.  The main method in FlexMXMLComponent needs to be cleaned up.  Debugging behaviors could be a lot easier.  I know that I have been inconsistent in some of my meta-programming techniques and I look forward to cleaning up based on what I have learned. </p>

<p>Please be forgiving.  I developed this primarily as a tool for myself under heavy deadline pressure to make an impossible project just barely possible.  It worked.  I think there is considerable value in this approach and I plan to clean this up, document it and release a screencast and example application in May or June. </p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

 summary : <p>LinkLens is a new approach to information management that provides an intuitive mix of tagging and folder hierarchies. LinkLens is built in ruby on rails. LinkLens allows a user to search the sets of associations between different artifacts such as users, resources, files, discussions and so on. In the web interface all artifacts can be dragged and dropped into a context box and the set of artifacts associated with the those in the context box are then displayed. The contents of the context box form a location, so other artifacts can then be dragged and dropped into the results pane which causes them to acquire associations with the current context artifacts.  New artifacts created will be placed in this location, since they will automatically acquire associations with everything in the context. This creates a sense of location associated with a set of artifacts and this serves as an alternative to locations defined by structured hierachies. The LinkLens system has been fast prototyped in Ruby on Rails and makes extensive use of Ruby on Rails AJAX support.</p>

<p>v1.1 released. Contains backwardly-incompatible bug fixes in that it renames some functions which were using JavaScript keywords as names. Also contains additional functions, cleaner code, etc. </p>

<p>--- </p>

<p>2008/08/26: A very few people will have noticed that the 1.1 version was not released on date. My computer needed a reinstall and it all took a bit longer than expected, which side-tracked me enough to start working on other things. Apologies to those who looked on the site for the release. </p>

<p>For now development is pretty much on hold, although that&#39;s not so bad, since about 95% of the original design has already been implemented and I&#39;m satisfied that I&#39;ve learnt a thing or two from this project. </p>

<p>Should any serious interest pick up around this library, I&#39;ll be more than happy to finish the last 5%, which was largely related to coercion and helpful functions for currying. </p>

 title : The liveparametric Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Google Sketchup contains an example Ruby class, Parametric, that allows a developer to specify a number of parameters to a program and lets the user enter these at runtime.  However, the parameters can only be entered as text, and it requires a certain amount of effort to change the parameters and try out different combinations. </p>

<p>LiveParametric  inherits from Parametric and makes it much easier to use parametric sketchup plugins while making almost no extra demands on the plugin writer.  Rather than use Sketchup&#39;s built-in UI.inputbox, it creates a custom WebDialog which can contain Sliders, TextFields, RadioButtons, Dropdown menus,  and whatever else we get around to adding.   </p>

<p>It may turn out that the dynamic WebDialog creation code is more valuable to Sketchup developers than the LiveParametric code, and that the two are modularized.  I&#39;ll see if there&#39;s any desire for this. </p>

 title : The locationauthentication Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>One of the standout attributes of Android applications will be the ability to use and share location.  </p>

<p>To alleviate privacy concerns with sharing sensitive location information, a location authentication scheme should be developed that allows users to securely share their location with others as well as securely request the location of others. </p>

<p>The two main components of such a system would be: </p>

<p>- A public key infrastructure with a certificate authority (C.A.) that links phone numbers and other identification information to public keys. 
<br/>- An Android application that communicates with the C.A. to validate others&#39; public keys, handle the communication of location with others, and maintain its own public key.  
<br/>I&#39;m including a more detailed spec of how I think the communication should work in the Wiki portion of this project. If you&#39;re interested, look it over and make edits/suggestions. I want to hash out the conceptual side as much as possible before starting a project of this scale. </p>

<p>One of my main concerns is hiding the private key. Any help in this particular area would be greatly appreciated, as would  help of all kinds ;) </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

 title : The log4j-snmp-trap-appender Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An appender to send formatted logging event strings to a specified managment host (typically, a MLM of some sort, but could also be an SNMP management console) in the form of an SNMP trap. </p>

<p>This appender does not attempt to provide full access to the SNMP API. In particular, use of this appender does not make an SNMP agent out of the calling application. You cannot use this appender as an interface to do SNMP GET or SET calls -- all it does is pass on your logging event as a TRAP. </p>

<p>This appender uses a helper class which serves as the interface to the SNMP sub-system. This class must implement the SnmpTrapSenderFacade interface. The concrete implementation class you want to use must be specified in your properties file -- see the examples below. The implementation class must provide a parameterless constructor -- this is the constructor that Log4J will use to instantiate the class using the class name in the properties file. </p>

<p>There are three implementation classes provided with this appender; the JoeSNMPTrapSender, the WengsoftSNMPTrapSender and the NetSnmpCommandLineTrapSender classes. If you fail to specify an implementation in your properties file, or if there is a problem finding, loading or instantiating the implementation that you do specify, the appender will fall back to using the JoeSNMPTrapSender implementation as a default. </p>

<p>You can and should, as your needs dictate, write your own implementation of SnmpTrapSenderFacade, using the underlying SNMP library of your choice. In this case, the implementations provided with the appender should serve as adequate examples for how this might be done. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a sample of what you would need in an XML configuration file to configure this appender: </p>

<p> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/>  </p>

<p>To configure an otherwise identical appender that uses a different implementation class, you would simply change the value of the &quot;ImplementationClassName&quot;, as in the following example: </p>

<p> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/>  </p>

<p>To configure the appender to use a delimited conversion pattern, to allow multiple VarBinds, you would drop the parameter </p>

<p> from the configuration, and change the Layout class to SnmpDelimitedConversionPatternLayout. You would then need to set the appropriate parameters of the Layout class. See SnmpDelimitedConversionPatternLayout for an explanation of using multiple VarBinds. </p>

<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/>  Here&#39;s a sample of what you would need in a properties configuration file to configure this appender:  </p>

<p>log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG=org.apache.log4j.ext.SNMPTrapAppender log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.ImplementationClassName=org.apache.log4j.ext.JoeSNMPTrapSender log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.ManagementHost=127.0.0.1 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.ManagementHostTrapListenPort=162 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.EnterpriseOID=1.3.6.1.4.1.24.0 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.LocalIPAddress=127.0.0.1 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.LocalTrapSendPort=161 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.GenericTrapType=6 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.SpecificTrapType=12345678 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.ApplicationTrapOID=1.3.6.1.4.1.24.12.10.22.64 log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.CommunityString=public log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.ForwardStackTraceWithTrap=true log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.Threshold=DEBUG log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.TRAP_LOG.layout.ConversionPattern=%d,%p,%t,%c,%m%n </p>

<p>changes ---  </p>

<p>2001-10-03: mwm : made changes needed to support v.1.1.1 of the SNMPTrapSenderFacade </p>

<p>2002-09-02: mwm : changed to be compatible with Log4J v. 1.2.x </p>

<p>2002-10-03: mwm : Made changes, mainly in #append, to deal with the new SnmpTrapSenderFacade interface architecture. </p>

<p>2002-10-15: mwm: Included the SysUpTimeResolver contributed by Thomas Muller. </p>

<p>2002-10-15: mwm : changed the sysUpTime value to a long, to cope with the SysUpTimeResolver mechanism. </p>

<p>2002-12-10: mwm : minor tweaks and prettying up of code. </p>

<p>2003-03-21: mwm : incorporated the first cut of Matt Monks&#39;s code to use a delimited conversion pattern string to allow mutliple VarBinds to be attached to the trap PDU. </p>

<p>2003-03-22: mwm : after reading Ceki&#39;s fine new book on Log4J, made several changes (for example, to the implementation of #close) to correct deficiencies in this class as an implementation of AppenderSkeleton. Also improved/added handling of the stack trace of the Throwable associated with the LoggingEvent, again inspired by Ceki&#39;s example in the new book. </p>

<p>2003-03-23: mwm : building on Matt Monks&#39;s ideas, added the SnmpDelimitedConversionPatternLayout, and used it to refactor the handling of the delimited conversion pattern case. </p>

<p>2003-05-24: mwm : minor changes to accomodate the change in the SnmpTrapSenderFacade interface, and added two new properties. </p>

<p>2003-07-05: mwm : some improvement in the exception handling of #loadImplementationClass </p>

<p>Motivation to create this toolI was working in my project and found a major problem with my bots that required to check a lot of states and conditions, so I decided to try some visual programming tools and rule based systems. The problem with this tools was that they need a framework and/or have their own language, plus the IDE and debugging tools where incomplete or out of date. </p>

<p>So I decided to try something simple, and use a FSM, a flow chart tool and generate Java from the output file, so I can have the best of the two worlds, a visual representation and Java code, the result was this tool. </p>

<p>I thought maybe this could help others, so I decided to make it public, please let me know what do you think or if you want to use it and need something extra, let me know, I can help. </p>

 title : The looloo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>About LooLooLooLoo represents modern, location-based service designed to support and utilize all of the advantages and cool new features of Google Android platform. It has strong integration with Google maps and delivers a fantastic mobile experience.  </p>

<p>All that you have to do is to create an account by choosing your personal preferences and then you can enter the fabulous world of LooLoo. Locate people with same passions, hobbies, same fears and dreams, same favorite TV shows or ice cream flavors. Exchange information, meet your soul-mate, fall in love. Find restaurants with your favorite meal or night clubs that suit your music taste, find which monuments and sites are must-see locations. Write reviews of places, rank them, promote your favorite ones. It is all here and on the palm of your hand, whole new chapter in the world of mobile applications. LooLoo is designed to be all that and much more... </p>

<p>Current StateAs you have probably realized by now, LooLoo service has huge potential and possibilities of its further development are only limited by one’s imagination. At the moment, the 0.2 version of LooLoo is being released and it shows only a glimpse of its power. For current version and testing purposes we have hardcoded a bunch of users and places around Mountain View, California. So far, the following features have been developed: </p>

<p>Place infoYou can access additional information about a certain place point by bringing it into focus and selecting point info from phone’s menu. At this moment, you can read name of the place, description, and initial rank. </p>

<p>Filter users by preferencesWhen filtering users by preferences you can set your matching criteria (0-100%), so that search only shows interesting candidates. </p>

<p>Login/LogoutAfter logging in, user gets unique session ID that allows him service usage. Logout deletes session ID. </p>

<p>Radius of search and matching percentageAllows you to select the radius of searched area and matching percentage parameter. </p>

<p>RefreshUpdates your current position and positions of other users on the map. </p>

<p>Edit profileYou can change your initial account settings in the edit profile menu. </p>

<p>Focused pointsBy clicking left/right on the jog dial of your mobile phone while in search view you can cycle through available points on the map. </p>

<p>Person infoYou can access additional information about a certain human point by bringing it into focus and selecting point info from phone’s menu. At this moment, you can find out user’s gender, year of birth, occupation, taste in movies, music taste and book taste. </p>

<p>Filter places by preferencesTypes of places shown on the map are directly correlated with the ones selected in your place preferences page of your profile. </p>

<p>Initial visual identityWhole set of specifically designed icons that match current android color scheme. </p>

<p>Future visionThe service is far from being finished. We have internally discussed about many of the following features and  though they are not still implemented, you can expect to see most of them in the very next update of our service. </p>

<p>More choicesPlan is to have much better categorization and smoother differentiation of preferences in order to fully characterize a user. </p>

<p>Review and ranking modelAt this moment, place information consists of a place name, place description and initial rank. Future plans include adding community driven ranking and reviews of places. The idea of review and ranking model that will separate the good places from the bad ones exists but has not been implemented yet. </p>

<p>DirectionsOption that will color user’s route to the desired place point on the map and connect with an external GPS application that will guide user throughout the way. </p>

<p>Adding placesThis will allow users to add places to the LooLoo’s main server database. </p>

<p>Favorite placesPossibility of selecting several favorite places (favorite restaurant, favorite night club, favorite theater, etc.) and hharing them with users that have similar interests. </p>

<p>Privacy levelsImplementation of different privacy levels that will allow users to determine which information they wish to share with other users. </p>

<p>SecurityImplementation of SSL during login to service. </p>

<p>Possibility of showing only people/placesAdding Radio group or menu item that will enable user to filter search results by people or places </p>

<p>People clusteringVery useful option that will improve map readability in dense population areas in great measure. It will group from 10 to 100 people with same interests into one spot. </p>

<p>Theme implementationAllowing user to fully change visual identity of application and adjust it according to his/her preferences.</p>
 title : The loper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Because Computing Doesn&#39;t Have to Suck.Conceptual elegance, simplicity, and hackability are not inevitable casualties of progress. </p>

<p>Goals include full reflectivity, introspection, orthogonal persistence (single address space), and full utilization of the new X86-64 architecture&#39;s capabilities. </p>

<p>Most (and eventually all) of Loper will be (re)developed from within Loper. </p>

<p>Yet another attempt at Lisp Machine resurrection?Much more than that. </p>

<p>A central purpose of the project is to shed certain absurdities that computer users have been putting up with for so long that they are now seen as inevitable: file systems; the distinction between code and data; multiple address spaces; (including the disk/RAM dichotomy) the storage of source code as raw ASCII text; and, last but not least, the &quot;compile/pray/debug&quot; cycle. </p>

<p>In the list of goals, playing nice with legacy-anything is dead last. Let&#39;s find out what a clean break with the past quarter-century could get us. </p>

<p>There will be very little detailed talk of planned features because there remains a very, very long way to go. Talk is cheap. </p>

 title : The loupe Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Loupe is a lightweight photogallery application. Rather than provide full fledged photo gallery features, Loupe leverages the photo management features of Flickr.  </p>

<p>It displays the photostream for a particular flickr user id. You can see photos, look at sets, navigate via tag cloud etc. Photo management, upload of photos, naming and taging them is done through Yahoo Flickr&#39;s user friendly photo management service. You can then host your portfolio and display the photos in exactly the manner you want using Loupe on your own web server. Whenever you make any changes to photos using Flickr, they are instantly reflected on your Loupe powered website. Since Loupe is CSS based, changing the default look of Loupe is as simple as making changes to the CSS file.  </p>

<p>Loupe is powered by Rails, the excellent framework for Ruby. It uses the rflickr API library to access Flickr. For displaying images it uses SlimBox, a clone of Lokesh Dhakar&#39;s LightBox JS library.</p>

 summary : <p>Lunar seeks to become a buildsystem framework that enables it&#39;s user to write complex, feature rich buildsystems with ease. </p>

<p>The core of Lunar consists of a file database to track modifications, a dependency calculator, a multithreaded build queue and means to distribute builds between multiple instances of Lunar via network. In fact the last one is most terrific since files have to be kept synchronized and generated output files have to be published to the other instances with minimal delay to name just a few problems with the idea. More information on the status of build distribution can be found here. </p>
