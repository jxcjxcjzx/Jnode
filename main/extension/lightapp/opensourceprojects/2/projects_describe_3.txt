MP parses these rules files to determine turn structure, card types, colors, etc.. making it impossible for players to cheat. Also, if a player forgets to do something during the game, he/she will be reminded since all rules are managed by Firemox.</p>

 title : The dolt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Dolt provides a drop-in replacement for libtool that significantly decreases compile times on the platforms it supports. Rather than the libtool approach of running a large script for every compile that repeatedly figures out how to build libraries on the platform, dolt figures out those details at configure time and writes out a minimal doltcompile script containing only the commands needed to build a library on the current platform.</p>

<p>If you use automake, autoconf, and libtool, then using dolt just requires two steps:</p>

<p>1. add DOLT after the call to LT_INIT, AC_PATH_LIBTOOL, or AM_PATH_LIBTOOL in your configure.ac or configure.in script, and
<br/>2. append dolt.m4 to your project&#39;s acinclude.m4.</p>

<p>For any platform Dolt does not support, it will transparently fall back to libtool.</p>

 summary : <p>LaTeXtaglet allows inclusion of mathematical equations in Javadocs.</p>

<p>This project was originally developed by Stephan Dlugosz and hosted at SourceForge.</p>

<p>The original source code is dependent of Windows conventions for directories and files names. The modified version of LaTeXtaglet described here runs fine on unix platforms but was never tested on Windows.</p>

<p>It&#39;s uncertain whether changes in the modified version were propagated back to the original code base as the original author apparently stopped improvements to the original code base. Hence, another code base was created under JQuantLib umbrella. JQuantLib uses LaTeXtaglet to generate nice Javadocs which contains UML diagrams and mathematical equations.</p>
