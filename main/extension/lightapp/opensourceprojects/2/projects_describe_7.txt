 title : The cleantogether Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mission statementTo create, as a community, a web site that will let people report their contribution into the worldwide effort of cleaning up the environment. </p>

<p>Motivation for the projecthttp://cleantogether.com :  This web site lets people post their environmental cleanup experiences. Whether you go to a beach, to a picnic, or on a hiking trip, think about how to bring some trash back home from the outdoors -- not only &quot;what you bring to nature, take back home&quot; kind of things, but think about the other stuff that gets left behind by others. You don&#39;t have to make your outdoor trip purpose to clean up (unless you want to) -- go have some fun, and at the end of the day contribute as much as you can (every bit counts). As you carry trash out, take a picture of your bag full of trash on- site (or it could be a picture of some really interesting finding that does not naturally belong to the environment), and post a blog story to the web site. Don&#39;t forget to tell where you found it and how much it weighs. Over time, some interesting statistics will accumulate, and the world will see our cleanup progress. </p>

<p>The project is built with Ruby on Rails version 2.0.1 . Some of the cool technologies the Cleantogether project uses are: Google Maps integrated with Rails Ajax, server-side updates, etc... </p>

<p>The code is free to share -- everyone is welcome to look at the code as well as to contribute cool ideas. The site is hosted at http://cleantogether.com </p>

<p>Unique Software Development ModelCleantogether.com is a unique project. How many other web sites do you know that are developed with an open source model? This project is pioneering the concept. Yes, there are thousands of open source projects hosted on Google Code, or sourceforge, or somewhere else. Most of these projects have one thing in common -- they develop a product that can be installed. Whether it&#39;s a framework like Struts (yes, good old Struts), or an OS like Linux, they all have a file that can be downloaded and installed on your local computer. Cleantogether.com has no end product that can be downloaded -- the result of collaborative development is a web site. </p>

<p>Motivation for developersSo, why as a developer should you care about contributing your talents and time to this particular project?  First of all, this project makes a difference to the world we live in. Everyone can contribute by going out there and cleaning up the environment and reporting on their progress. Developers can use their unique set of skills to make the web site nicer, to add new functionality that makes the web site experience better for the rest of us, or simply to fix a bug. Currently, the web site has very basic design, content and functionality. Some might argue that there is not much to add. Actually, in our view the possibilities are endless. For example we can add features like the DIGG.com style discussions, we can also add all sorts of statistics to the site so everyone can monitor the cleaning progress (and awareness level) around the world. We can also add features like creating cleanup projects where a group of people can get together and compete with each other or even challenge some other groups. And we can even start thinking about charging some fee to companies that want to organize their employees for an environmental cleanup day, in return for publicity (see about this in the next section). Individual contributors will always be able to use this site for free. And the last-but-not-least reason for developers to contribute -- this project is built on some of the coolest technologies out there: Ruby on Rails, Google maps, Ajax, MySQL, etc... So if you are a developer as passionate as we are about web technologies and keeping the world we all live in clean -- please roll up your sleeves and help! </p>

<p>Software as a ServiceFrom the very beginning cleantogether.com is taking a &quot;software as a service&quot; approach. Delegating responsibilities to other services that can do it better, rather then writing everything in house, seems to be the right way to go. We already use two third-party services. One is http://captchator.com , that generates and verifies captcha images to keep spammers away. The other one is a google maps which does not require special introduction (simply one of the best web based mapping solutions). This is great because it does take some load off of our server and allows us to concentrate on our business. The next service we are going to be integrating with is an authentication/authorization solution offered by http://RootLocusInc.com hosted as a service at http://preallowed.com </p>

<p>Potential profitabilityIt is not unusual to make a profit off of open source project. Red Hat is one remarkable example. Also, Google has open-sourced most of its code but still has been able to build a remarkable and wealthy technological empire. Our project has all of it&#39;s code open sourced. Right now the site is maintained by a few enthusiasts who really believe in what we do, and who want to make the world a cleaner place. Eventually, in order to be able to keep the site up and running we will need to pay our bills. For now, while the site is very basic in functionality and the traffic is very low, we can afford to fund it ourselves. But we envision that down the road it will change (a good thing), and then we will need to consider some way of generating a cash flow. All the money earned will be invested either in web site support and maintenance, or in other environmental projects. We might even consider making fair rewards to the developers who contributed to the project (at this point it&#39;s too early to talk about, but is definitely a possibility). </p>

 summary : <p>CPAN is a great delivery site. But it doesn&#39;t offer a way to version scripts while they are being edited, which becomes necessary as soon as there are more than 2 people collaborating. Also, there is a need to maintain design documents beyond what the mere user wants to download and install, as well as to keep a log of related communications.</p>

 title : The cminus-compiler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology.  Some development requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit testing frameworks.  In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform that will ultimately execute the test.  Because of this assumption many frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test. </p>

<p>Cmockery only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers.  Also, Cmockery tries to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers. </p>

<p>This results in Cmockery being a relatively small library that can be used to test a variety of exotic code.  If a developer wishes to simply test an application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be preferable. </p>

<br/>Assignment 5: Learning
<br/>Due Dec. 4 at 11:59pm
<br/>This assignment can be done in pairs.
<br/>Important Note: The univeristy policy on academic dishonesty (cheating) will be taken
<br/>very seriously in this course. Students will work in pairs on this assignment. You may not
<br/>discuss the speciﬁc questions in this assignment, nor their solutions with any other group.
<br/>You may not provide or use any solution, in whole or in part, to or by another group.
<br/>You are encouraged to discuss the general concepts involved in the questions in the context
<br/>of completely diﬀerent problems. If you are in doubt as to what constitutes acceptable
<br/>discussion, please ask! Further, please take advantage of oﬃce hours oﬀered by the instructor
<br/>and the TA if you are having diﬃculties with this assignment.
<br/>Part 0: Handwritten Digits
<br/>Download the images from the course website. There are two paths to follow, the MATLAB
<br/>path (which I believe to be easier), and the Java path (which you may be much more familiar
<br/>with). Choose one of the following:
<br/>1. Tarball 1.1 (data java.tar.gz) contains a huge set of 60000 training images, examples
<br/>of handwritten digits. The binary ﬁle format is a pair of integers giving the height h and
<br/>width w of the image, followed by a list of hw integers. Tarball 1.2 (code java.tar) contains
<br/>code for reading in these images, written in Java. Along with the directory of images is a
<br/>ﬁle containing 60000 labels (integers in {0, 1, . . . , 9}) in the same format as the image ﬁles h
<br/>is 60000, w is 1. Again, code for reading these in Java is available.
<br/>2. Tarball 2.1 (data matlab.tar.gz) contains 2 data ﬁles, and Tarball 2.2 (code matlab.tar)
<br/>a matlab function for reading in these data ﬁles. Running the function [train images,
<br/>train labels] = readData; will store a 28-by-28-by-60000 array in train images and a
<br/>60000-by-1 array in train labels. Each entry train images(:,:,i) corresponds to one
<br/>image. An image can be viewed by simply typing figure; imshow(train images(:,:,i)).
<br/>If you do not have large amounts of RAM, instead load train1000.mat (load(’train1000.mat’)),
<br/>which will load only the ﬁrst 1000 images and labels into variables train images1000 and
<br/>train labels1000. If you also don’t have a newer version of matlab which allows compressed
<br/>.mat ﬁles, use load(’train1000v6.mat’) after gunzipping said ﬁle.
<br/>For your viewing pleasure, all 60000 training images have been converted to JPEG format,
<br/>and are available as a tarball on the course website. It is not recommended that you use
<br/>these as input to your program, as this JPEG compression is lossy.</p>

<p>Part 1: Perceptron Learning
<br/>Train a single layer perceptron to recognize the digit 7 in your chosen programming language.
<br/>There should be M = 28 ∗ 28 + 1 = 785 input units (xi ), one for each pixel in an image,
<br/>plus a bias term (which is set to -1 for all inputs). There is one output unit, which should
<br/>be trained to be 1 if the image is of a digit 7, and 0 otherwise.
<br/>Your method should initialize the 785 weights Wj to some random values, and use the
<br/>Perceptron Learning algorithm to ﬁnd (locally) optimal weights using gradient descent.
<br/>Use a subset of the 60000 images to train your perceptron (perhaps the ﬁrst 100, or ﬁrst
<br/>1000, or ﬁrst 10000).
<br/>Pseudocode for perceptron learning:
<br/>W = random initial values
<br/>for iter = 1 to T
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for i = 1 to N (all examples)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x = input for example i
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y = output for example i
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wold = W
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Err = y − g(Wold · x)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for j = 1 to M (all weights)
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wj = Wj + α · Err · g′ (Wold · x) · xj
<br/>For your testing output, show the learned weights Wj (without the bias term) as an image
<br/>(use reshape(W(1:end-1),[28 28]) in MATLAB, or write a pgm image using the provided routine in Java). Comment brieﬂy on what you see.
<br/>A test example with input x is classiﬁed as a 7 if the output g(W · x) of the ﬁnal perceptron
<br/>is greater than 0.5.
<br/>Also show the results of testing your perceptron on a test set chosen as subset of the provided
<br/>data (disjoint from the training set you use). Report the classiﬁcation results for at least 5
<br/>diﬀerent training set sizes. For each training set size, run at least 5 diﬀerent experiments
<br/>with a diﬀerent random training set of the given size. Note that a “random” subset can
<br/>be obtained using randperm in MATLAB, or by starting from a random index (Java or
<br/>MATLAB). Plot % correct on test set versus # training examples on a graph by hand, in
<br/>MATLAB, or using your favourite program.
<br/>Part 2: Neural Networks
<br/>Create a neural network that attempts to recognize all of the digits 0 through 9. There should
<br/>be 10 output units, one corresponding to each of the 10 digits. The rest of the structure of
<br/>the network is up to you.
<br/>There should be at least 1 hidden layer of nodes in between the input and output layers. The
<br/>input layer does not have to be all 784 input pixels (plus a bias term), it can be something
<br/>else of your choosing.
<br/>Train this network using back-propagation (see lecture slides).
<br/>Again, train using some subset of the 60000 images, and use a disjoint subset to test your
<br/>trained network. Again, show recognition rates on using at least 2 diﬀerent sizes of training
<br/>set (one run for each is suﬃcient this time).
<br/>I will use a completely separate set of images to test your networks for the digit recognition
<br/>contest. For the contest:
<br/>1. If you are using Java, please create a class RecognizeDigits XX YY, with your student
<br/>numbers in place of XX and YY, as before. This class should extend the template class
<br/>RecognizeDigits provided.
<br/>2. If you are using MATLAB, please create a function recognizeDigits XX YY, with your
<br/>student numbers in place of XX and YY as before. Use the template provided without
<br/>changing the function header.
<br/>In short, your function/class should work with the run tournament ﬁle provided, with
<br/>absolutely no modiﬁcations.
<br/>Submitting Your Assignment
<br/>You must create your assignment in electronic form. For each part of the assignment, submit
<br/>the source code as well as the test output mentioned in each question. For part 2 give a brief
<br/>summary of the structure of the network used, and any other design choices made. Submit
<br/>these in one of the formats listed below.

 title : The cobble Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Cobble aims to offer a high quality, easy to use library of data structures. </p>

<p>It is written entirely in C, and it offers various functions to efficiently create and manipulate common data structures, like lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and many more. </p>

<p>Although the main purpose of this project is to serve as an additional support for the Data Structures course taught in The Faculty of Automation and Computer Science, University &#39;Politehnica&#39; of Bucharest, Cobble can be used as well in any non-academic applications and purposes.</p>
 summary : <p>CocoaAsyncSocket supports TCP and UDP.  The AsyncSocket class is for TCP, and the AsyncUdpSocket class is for UDP.  Each class is described below. </p>

<p>AsyncSocket is a TCP/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket and CFStream.  It offers asynchronous operation, and a native cocoa class complete with delegate support.  Here are the key features: </p>

<p>Queued non-blocking reads and writes, with optional timeouts. You tell it what to read or write, and it will call you when it&#39;s done. Automatic socket acceptance. If you tell it to accept connections, it will call you with new instances of itself for each connection. You can, of course, disconnect them immediately. Delegate support. Errors, connections, accepts, read completions, write completions, progress, and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method. Run-loop based, not thread based. Although you can use it on main or worker threads, you don&#39;t have to. It calls the delegate methods asynchronously using NSRunLoop. The delegate methods include a socket parameter, allowing you to distinguish between many instances. Self-contained in one class. You don&#39;t need to muck around with streams or sockets. The class handles all of that. Support for TCP streams over IPv4 and IPv6. The library is public domain, originally written by Dustin Voss.  Now available in a public setting to allow and encourage its continued support. </p>

<p>AsyncUdpSocket is a UDP/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket.  It works almost exactly like the TCP version, but is designed specifically for UDP.  This includes queued non-blocking send/receive operations, full delegate support, run-loop based, self-contained class, and support for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

 title : The cocoahttpserver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Sometimes Cocoa developers need an HTTP server in their code. Perhaps they&#39;re writing a file-sharing app, or maybe they want to allow website links to communicate with built-in software similar to iTMS links. Obviously the built-in apache server is not an option. Thus the need for a small, lightweight, embedded HTTP server. This is what we needed for Mojo and we found a few available solutions: </p>

<p>Apple&#39;s CocoaHTTPServer CultureCode&#39;s Simple HTTP Server WuffHTTPD for $100 USD We liked Apple&#39;s the best because it was free and was built using standard networking sockets and streams. However, it didn&#39;t have everything we needed, and it seemed to have a few memory leaks. (We patched a few, but it still looked like it was leaking somewhere...) So with Apple&#39;s framework for an HTTP server tucked under our arm we set out to make our own. We wanted the following: </p>

<p>Built in support for bonjour broadcasting IPv4 and IPv6 support Asynchronous networking using standard Cocoa sockets/streams Digest access authentication TLS encryption support Extremely FAST and memory efficient Heavily commented code Very easily extensible This is the result of our hard work. </p>

 title : The cocoanav Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CocoaNav parses OSX frameworks and makes them searchable in a nice Core Animation View. </p>

<p>CocoaNav is mostly written in RubyCocoa, with two ObjectiveC classes : CNItem and FrameworkViewBackground. It&#39;s a document based app. </p>

<p>Download CocoaNav </p>

<p>InternalsModel and controllersApplicationController manages data : handles FrameworkParsing, preferences, computing the ClassTree, WalkingTheTree, and FrameworkColors CNItem is the all purpose data class : it stores parsed class names, methods, protocols and categories  CNDocument backs document windows : specifies DocumentType and UserFrameworks FrameworkColor : CoreData class for managing text and background colors of frameworks WindowsCNWindow is the main window : handles coordination between the 3 views : FrameworkView, CrumbView, ItemTableView CNAboutWindow : the about window showing a WebView, backed by a Core Animation Quartz Composition CNPreferencesWindow : handles FrameworkColors editing ViewsViews ShareSelection. </p>

<p>FrameworkViewBackground : draws a radial gradient as a background. This class exists because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to draw the gradient with RubyCocoa FrameworkView : the meat of what you&#39;ll see. For each Objective C class, creates a matching layer. Two view modes : framework (classes inside their frameworks) or ClassTree (classes linked to their parents) CrumbView : for each class, draws inheritance crumb. For NSButton, draws NSObject &gt; NSResponder &gt; NSControl &gt; NSButton.  ItemTableView : displays every framework/class/method/protocol/category loaded and search them </p>

<p>TODObetter parsing, to handle C methods and structs. Maybe via Pygments. (Then we&#39;ll be able to index stuff like CATransform3DMakeScale) when parsing user frameworks,  parse .m files BACK / FORWARD ! maintain a history list, a la Safari it&#39;s taking too long on load -&gt; move CNItem to CoreData  better refresh on color change (?) UserFrameworks : load all files and make them visually searchable - just like in FrameworkView, to see each instance of a search term UserFrameworks : compute function depth usage and order. Trace usage of one function trough the code, see how deep it&#39;s called (call stack), where it&#39;s called, by whom parameter use : for each method or function, index its parameters -&gt; see what&#39;s being called by whom stuff like Demeter&#39;s Law : trail an object to see how deeply it&#39;s used real bindings between views : right now it sucks.  save document window positions AND contents. via Core Data ? On relaunch, you get exactly what you quit from. framework stats : classes count, method count, … allow user framework removal search within help webview</p>
 summary : <p>Cocoatron </p>

<p>The suite of Automator Actions for Mac OS X that brings drag-and-drop simplicity to creating and automating complex XML Processing Pipelines.&#39; </p>

<p>To install, download Cocoatron and unzip. Then drag the Cocoatron .action and .definition files to ~/Library/Automator. You may need to create this folder. Inspired by XProc and SXPipe, Cocoatron is a simple way to create XML pipelines visually - without writing a line of custom &#39;glue&#39; code in Java, C++ or other languages. </p>

<p>Conceptually, Cocoatron is a combination of XProc and Apple&#39;s Automator application. XProc is the W3C&#39;s spec for high-level descriptions of XML processing pipelines. Automator is Apple&#39;s graphical application for creating scripting pipelines with drag-and-drop simplicity. </p>

<p>Cocoatron consists of six Automator Actions (composeable, configurable pipeline stages): </p>

<p>Load XML Documents Process XIncludes of XML Documents Validate XML Documents (DTD, XSD, RNG) Transform XML Documents (XSLT) Query XML Documents (XQuery) Serialize XML Documents Implemented using the powerful libxml2 framework, Cocoatron includes support for XInclude, XSLT 1.0, EXSLT, XQuery, and validation against DTD, W3C XML Schema, and RELAX NG XML syntax.. </p>

<p>Much like SXPipe, these actions deal strictly with XML Infosets. Under the hood, the XML Infosets created and returned by Cocoatron Actions are actually libxml2 xmlDocPtr structs contained in Cocoa object wrappers. An Infoset is constructed using Load XML Documents and serialized back to text using Serialize XML Documents. To create pipleines, place other, built-in Apple Actions before and after these two Actions. </p>

<p>For example, start an XML pipeline with local XML documents using Get Specified Finder Items (Finder) or remote ones using Get Specified URLs (Safari). Finish a pipleine with New Text File (Finder) or New TextEdit Document (TextEdit). </p>

<p>Each Cocoatron Action includes a collapsable Console text field that will show you any errors or warnings that occur during that Aciton&#39;s processing. This allows for easy debugging. </p>

<p>As compared to the Beta release last week, v1.0 significantly improves behavior of Load XML Documents and fixes a nasty bug where dragging a Cocoatron Action into a Workflow would temporarily disable the &#39;Run&#39; button. </p>

<p>Implementation Details </p>

<p>Cocoatron is written in Objective-C and C, and is based on: </p>

<p>libxml libxslt libexslt Apple&#39;s Cocoa Frameworks Apple&#39;s NSXML Framework Cocoatron requires Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger or later. </p>

<p>Cocoatron is developed by Todd Ditchendorf. Have feedback? Email me.</p>

 title : The cocotron-tools-gpl3 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cocotron Development Tools which are under the GPL v3, </p>
 summary : <p>CocoXml is inspired by Coco/R and modified from it. </p>

<p>Coco/R is released under GPLv2 and written by Hanspeter Moessenboeck, University of Linz. Its homepage is http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/ . </p>

<p>CocoXml is released under GPLv2 too. </p>

<p>Coco/R can read an atg file and tempalte files, then generate scanner and parser for user. Different versions are implemented for different languages, such as C#, Java and C++ and so on. </p>

<p>Firstly, I modify Coco/R so it can accept a different atg. This new atg can be used to parse the tag/attribute structure base on the result of SAX parser, just like XCC does. For the detail of XCC, please access: ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/xcc/. CocoXml use the EBNF to describe the syntax of tags, attributes and other XML elements. It is a strict way and can parse complex XML structure easily. </p>

<p>Then CocoXml-0.9.0.tar.gz is released. </p>

<p>After that, it is realized that if CocoXml is provided in the Coco/R way, the core algorithm has to be implemented in all supported languages again and again. This is not a necessitation. And I also need a stronger implement of Coco/R in C, so it can be used to generate various parsers in C. </p>

<p>So I decide to re-implement Coco/R in pure-C and split the output schemes from algorithm completely. And when a new programming language support is required, define a new output scheme is enough. </p>

<p>Another advantage of C implemented Coco/R is there are least dependencies, so the user can install it easily. And linux distribution can distribute it easily too. </p>

<p>Now the new implemented Coco(in c) and CocoXml are combined into one binary. If the extension of the input is .atg, it is treated as a syntax of the original Coco. If the extension of the input is .xatg, it is treated as a syntax of CocoXml. </p>

<p>Some more improvements are introduced too. For the details, please refer to the wiki of CocoXml, which can be accessed at http://code.google.com/p/cocoxml/w/list . </p>

<p>The source of CocoXml can be checkout with the following command: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://cocoxml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk cocoxml-read-only.The referenced Coco/R code are committed into svn too, so my modifications can be show easily. :)</p>

 title : The colorediffs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is an extension that colors boring diffs sent by SVN/CVS notificators. </p>

<p>PrerequisitesA lot of developers use CVS and/or SVN version control systems. Most of also receive special notifications from the system about changes other people do. They might be useful in various ways: someone wants to check if there are bugs in the new code, someone just wants to keep knowledge of code base up-to-date. But looking over that black-on-white letter is so boring. That&#39;s why I decided to color it up a bit. </p>

<p>What it can do already </p>

<p>Well, not so much... It can color your diffs, it can show them in side-by-side mode if you like. Also it converts all the filenames in message log into links so you can quickly jump to the file you want to review. Ah, and it can make space and tabs chars visible. You can look through list of SupportedFormats and if your format isn&#39;t there write me an email. </p>

<p>What it will doIn the future I want this extension to be able to do following: </p>

<p>Highlight the actual difference between the lines Color the syntax of the language used Check new code against few rules in order to estimate quality of it But that&#39;s pretty big tasks, it could take a while to implement them. </p>

<p>ContributionIf you know how to do something better, whether it&#39;s code, icons, default color scheme, just contact me. Also please visit the issues list and star or comment the issues you&#39;d really like to be done first. </p>

<p>Firefox extensionThere isn&#39;t one and probably never will be, sorry. I could make it work for diff in  sections (most mail lists archives format them like this) but it would never work in GMail and other Web mail systems where it would be actually useful. It&#39;s just plain hard to find the code between the lines of normal text. But you could ease you pain with Bookmarklet I wrote when your needs is simple (like mail list archives) and GreaseMonkey script written by Fabrice Bellingard for GMail.

 title : The commando-for-flex Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What&#39;s Commando?Commando is an extension to Adobe Cairngorm that provides developers with the tools to parse command lines with options into Cairngorm Commands. Command lines can look like: </p>

<p>command-name -o command-name --long-option command-name --option-with-arg argvalue command-name -a &quot;long arg value&quot; </p>

<p>Commando is currently in Beta and is built using Flex 3. Commando is not a branch of Cairngorm, but depends on Cairngorm for compilation and at runtime. This means that the Cairngorm swc needs to be present to compile Commando and to run a project that uses Commando. </p>

 title : The common-oss-binary-dist Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a non-source project that is encouraged to be used by other source based projects. It represents a container for binary distributions and their accompanying licenses. The purpose of this repository is to enable other projects to be able to conveniently reference a specific distribution’s release binaries using “svn:externals”.  Hence, this shared repository thus reduces the foot print of other source based repositories (typically their included libraries). Please note, this repository will only contain specific releases of distributions that have been linked into sources. You should always visit the original publishers site for other all releases of a given product.</p>

<p>The reason why this repository is needed:
<br/>* Most distribution bundles are either source or binary, but not both
<br/>* Many source distributions force builders to go fetch their specific releases of their dependencies. This unnecessarily complicates the process of building a code base
<br/>* Some binary distributions disappear with abandoned projects
<br/>* Not all open source software is published under a subversion repository</p>
 title : The commoncache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CCache(Common Cache) is a cache libary writing for the one who would like to cache data for frequent visiting.It caches data using mmap and makes you operating (insert, find, update, delete etc.) data very fast. Unlike memcached, it is a static libary, not a server, and if you want to use it, you must write server by youself, ccache does not care the protocol between server and client, and you must write your function pointer to compare the key in cache when you want to operate it(see demo in the test/testcache.c). </p>

<p>CommonCache Main feature using mmap to cache data in file, so it can be used in multi-thead and multi-process application. support unfix size key node support hash-rbtree and hash-list structure use LRU algorithm to eliminate nodes when it is running out of its memory size fast, 100W/read operation on fix-size key node in no more than 0.5 second CommonCache documentFollowing is the Commoncache document: </p>

 title : The compcache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project creates RAM based block device (named ramzswap) which acts as swap disk. Pages swapped to this disk are compressed and stored in memory itself. </p>

<p>Compressing pages and keeping them in RAM virtually increases its capacity. This allows more applications to fit in given amount of memory. </p>

<p>The usual argument I get is - memory is so cheap so why bother with compression? So I list here some of the use cases. Rest depends on your imagination :) </p>

<p>Embedded Devices:  Memory is scarce and adding more memory increases device cost.  Also, flash storage suffers from wear-leveling issues, so its useful if we can avoid using them as swap device. Netbooks: Market is now getting flooded with these &quot;lighweight laptops&quot;. These are memory constrained but have CPU enough to drive on compressed me</p>

 summary : <p>Components is a high-level JavaScript framework. It helps you write cleaner, clearer applications with less code and less effort. </p>

<p>It revolves around having a model for the interface instead of tons of CSS queries. The model gives you all the page access you need, with simple conventions for describing Requests, Updates and Events. </p>

<p>It looks like this...Here&#39;s a rewrite of an example from jQuery: </p>

<p>bind(&#39;gallery&#39;, {</p>

<p>  onLoadFocal: function() {
<br/>    this.clear(&#39;loading&#39;);
<br/>    this.focal.appear();

<br/>    this.apply(&#39;loading&#39;);
<br/>    this.focal.fade(function() {
<br/>      this.replace(&#39;&#39;).element.src = source;
<br/>    });
<br/>  }

 title : The compressedbitset Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionThis implements RLE compressed bitset for Java. The RLE compression scheme is Word-Aligned Hybrid compression scheme from LBNL. </p>

<p>This package exists because of general lack of compressed bitset implementations in Java. This package implements the Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression scheme from LBNL, which compresses the bitsets without sacrificing performance. The code is derived from the original authors&#39; FastBit software and pseudo-codes in the paper.  </p>

<p>LimitationsCurrently the WAHBitSet class allows appends only and the number of operations implemented on the bitsets are also limited to AND, OR operations.  </p>

<p>Performance NoteIn the compressed bitset, checking for every single bit is expensive, but doing operations such as AND and OR with other compressed bitsets is quite fast (They work on compressed bitsets, without uncompressing them at all). Use -server option while starting Java to get the most performance.</p>
 summary : <p>This project is an exploration of documented AI agents and other models within the cognitive sciences. It is currently in a very early stage of development with only a simple environment for agents, random mazes, complete as of this writing.  </p>

<p>The code is being developed using SBCL, an implementation of Common Lisp, within a Eclipse/CUSP environment. The author&#39;s primary development platform is Ubuntu 8.04 on a dual core AMD. However, the code is largely platform independent. </p>

<p>Building/Using: -Install the C/C+ SDL libraries on your system from http://www.libsdl.org/. </p>

<p>-Install the lispbuilder-sdl library. I strongly recommend using asdf, http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf-install/, for this. The lispbuilder installation documentation appears pretty far out of date. As of this writing, the following commands worked for me. (require &#39;asdf-install) (asdf-install:install :lispbuilder-sdl) (asdf-install:install :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx) </p>

<p>-Load the project asd files. lisp-utils.asd should be loaded prior to any others.  </p>

<p>Known Issues: -The SDL bindings do not behave well on OS X when using Lisp with SLIME (this applies to Eclipse/CUSP as well). This is thought to be due to window eventing issues due to threading (SDL window does not update). The problem does not manifest on Linux/X platforms. I haven&#39;t tried Windows.</p>

 title : The concurrentlinkedhashmap Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A high performance version of java.util.LinkedHashMap for use as a software cache. </p>

<p>DesignA concurrent linked list runs through a ConcurrentHashMap to provide eviction ordering. Supports insertion and access ordered eviction policies (FIFO, LRU, and Second Chance). StatusTesting new algorithm. Original AlgorithmThe Sept. 2008 jar contains the initial version, which uses a concurrent deque that runs through a ConcurrentHashMap. For simplicity, the implementation used a lazy removal strategy to allow focusing on validating the doubly linked list. A backtracking eager removal strategy was initially prototyped, but not adopted due to concerns over management of the data races. </p>

<p>According to Greg&#39;s benchmarks, he found up to a 92.5x performance gain when compared to the previous version of Ehcache (v1.5). </p>

<p>Note: A rare race condition was uncovered by Greg Luck (Ehcache). This algorithm is deprecated. </p>

<p>Current AlgorithmThe design document describes a newer approach based on per-node spin-locks. </p>

<p>Note: The algorithm needs further testing and is not deemed production ready. It is functional under concurrent tests, but needs additional load testing to assert correctness. </p>

<p>Production VersionDue to popular demand and accidental usages in production environments, a certified production-ready version is provided for download. This version is will provide the desired performance without using experimental code intended for personal education. The modifications are documented outside of the repository. </p>

<p>FutureAfter the current algorithm is released, work will begin towards maturing it into a lock-free algorithm. A lock-free algorithm is non-blocking, maintains the list in an acceptable but not always perfect state, and coerces to the desired state. This changes the thought process of trying to block concurrent operations from corrupting shared state to making them work together to arrive at a final state. </p>

<p>LicenseThe algorithms and code are provided as-is under the APL-2. They were built primarily for fun and as a hobby project. The main motivation was that the puzzle of how to implement a concurrent linked hashmap sounded quite enjoyable (and educational). </p>

<p>To figure it out for myself, I avoided venturing into certain academic literature. While this may make progress slower, it allows me to understand the algorithms rather than copying them. That said, others are free to use this structure as a template and make the necessary changes to implement one of those algorithms.</p>

 summary : <p>End-user applications that take advantage of users&#39; current context and respond appropriately have traditionally been the exclusive domain of HCI researchers working in university or research labs. An extensive and robust literature describes architectures and techniques for making daily computing calmer and more humane, but these findings and tools thus far have not made the jump from the research lab to daily use. </p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to adapt and implement the results of this research as useful frameworks and tools that real-world end-users may employ to improve their daily computing experiences. </p>

<p>Current ToolsSound Effects Growl Plugin: This plugin builds upon Matthew Walton&#39;s popular Smoke plugin by adding a simple rule-based system for selecting different sound effects to accompany different kinds of notifications. This plugin may be used to add sound effects to applications that previously had none, in addition to customizing the audio and visual intrusiveness of incoming notifications. This plugin is available within the Downloads tab above. </p>

Being multi-threaded, and able to play PAFF streams, it can handle HD H.264/AVC streams that no freely available codecs can.  CoreAVC is reasonably priced at ~$15, but it is Windows only. </p>

<p>2010-01-03: CoreAVC-for-Linux has been updated to support all versions of CoreAVC from 1.0 through 2.0.  Using Wine is now a requirement for installation and using dshowserver.  The old mplayer based Win32 code is still available but is no longer supported.  Dshowserver should now work on any platform that Wine can run on. </p>

 summary : <p>CoreDC The aim of the project is to produce a well documented and simple to use library implementing the Direct Connect p2p protocol. Mainly in order to simplify the process of writing programs to communicate over the DC protocol. </p>

<p>We are closing in on a first release, but you already download the latest source from the svn and compile your own, fully working version. Some things are not yet implemented, but basic functionality works. </p>

<p>CoreDC currently features simple methods to:Connect / disconnect to a specified DC hub. Send / recieve raw hub messages. S/r mainchat messages. S/r private messages. S/r passive searches. Recieve passive searchresults. It automatically handles login procedure and tcp communications and works with all major hubsofts (not tested with all minor ones yet).</p>

 summary : <p>The Cortex project aims to provide a set of high quality C++ libraries and Python modules tailored for software development in the visual effects industry. Rather than producing end user tools, the project focuses on creating a reusable set of modules of use to TDs and programmers in a broad range of scenarios - allowing them to focus on the more interesting or innovative aspects of development. </p>

<p>Originally the brainchild of Andrew Chapman, the Cortex project is now being developed around the IECore library developed in house at Image Engine and subsequently released as open source. Initially, Image Engine are providing the core library and Python bindings, along with their RenderMan, Maya, OpenGL, and Nuke support libraries. </p>

<p>It is hoped that the Cortex project will attract contributions from the wider visual effects community, and grow to provide a rich set of functionality and support for further 3rd party applications.</p>

 summary : <p>An updated java library for interacting with the newer JSON-based CouchDB. </p>

<p>After looking into CouchDB, I attempted to use the existing couchdb-lib project from egor.margineanu.  However, the original CouchDB used an XML document  format, but the latest uses JSON for it&#39;s document format.  The URL schemes have also  changed since then.  Basically, it didn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>So, since that wasn&#39;t going to work, I set about to write my own. </p>

<p>If you have questions, or find bugs, let me know! </p>

 summary : <p>Counterpart is an application server based primarily on the V8 JavaScript (ECMAScript) compiler and the FastCGI library. Its goal is to enable a safe, fast, curly-brace-friendly programming environment for web development, including a robust set of extensions (JavaScript, binary shared library, or a combination thereof). </p>

<p>Counterpart is presently being built on Ubuntu Linux, but support is planned for BSD (including Mac OS X) and some reasonably modern flavor of Windows (IIS, not that we don&#39;t love Cygwin). </p>

<p>Counterpart bootstraps itself at first with C++, but its goal is to let JavaScript do the heavy lifting, even to the point of taking over much of bootstrapping. </p>

<p>The name refers to the fact that it&#39;s only reasonable to write client-side and server-side code in the same language. Counterpart began life named &#39;rainforest&#39; for obscure historical reasons. Thanks to Daniel Bogan for helping brainstorm the new name and logo. </p>

<p>Related projects: </p>

<p>V8, the JavaScript engine on which Counterpart is based. v8r, a command-line processor. llv8call, a native library for V8 we are hoping to be able to build as an extension. Dino Engine, a &quot;web framework&quot; which uses V8. The documentation is in French, so I can&#39;t really compare and contrast Counterpart.</p>

 summary : <p>The CrashRpt library is a light weight error handling framework. This module will intercept any unhandled exception generated by an application, build a complete debug report and send the report to the software author.  The library can also be used to gather and send user feedback. </p>

<p>Figure 1 - Main Dialog </p>

<p>OverviewIf you&#39;ve ever been tasked with debugging a fatal exception, you probably know how difficult it can be given only the user&#39;s steps to reproduce. Many factors such as the application&#39;s version, user&#39;s operating system, and dependent modules may contribute to the eventual crash. This makes duplicating the user&#39;s environment and thereby the crash, nearly impossible for all but the most obvious bugs. </p>

<p>The CrashRpt library is a light weight error handling framework. This module will intercept any unhandled exception generated by your application, build a complete debug report, and optionally, mail the report to you. </p>

<p>UsageIn this article, a crash report refers to a collection of files intended to help the developer quickly diagnose the cause of a crash. Specifically the crash report includes a minidump, a crash log and up to ten additional application specific files supplied by the application via a crash callback. Of these the most useful will most likely be the application minidump. The minidump contains the call stack, local variables, details all of your application&#39;s modules, and can even help pinpoint the source line number that generated the exception. </p>

<p>The CrashRpt DLL works like the new Dr. Watson utility that ships with XP. It intercepts unhandled exceptions, creates a minidump, builds a crash log, presents an interface to allow the user to review the crash report, and finally it compresses and optionally emails the crash report back to you. </p>

<p>When an unhandled exception is detected, CrashRpt notifies the user and allows them to review the report contents. First the main dialog shown above is displayed. From here the user can enter their comments and email address or review the report contents by clicking the hyperlink. This takes them to the details dialog, where they are presented with the files that make up the report. Double clicking on the filename will open that file in its associated program, if an association exists for that file type. </p>

<p>Figure 2 - Crash Details Dialog </p>

<p>Once the user is satisfied, he may close the details dialog and click the &#39;Send&#39; button on the main dialog, which will email his complete crash report to you. </p>

<p>Using the CrashRpt library in Your ApplicationBuilding the libraryDownload and unzip the source code attached to this article. Open the complete.dsw workspace located in the top level directory. This workspace contains the source for the two sample applications and the CrashRpt library. You only need to build the CrashRpt project - crashrpt.dsp. </p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p> CrashRpt library uses the WTL for its GUI components, so WTL must be installed and properly configured in order to build the CrashRpt library. You can download the WTL here. If you&#39;re new to the WTL then CodeProject has some article here, and there is a good starting guide here. 2. CrashRpt library uses Microsoft&#39;s Debug Help library (dbghelp.dll). The proper h and lib files must be installed and properly configured in order to build the CrashRpt library. These files are available in the Debugging SDK, which can be downloaded here (be sure to select the SDK setup option).  
<br/>After the build completes, you should end up with the following: </p>

<p>crashrpt\include
<br/>crashrpt.h </p>

<p>crashrpt\bin\debug or crashrpt\bin\release
<br/>crashrpt.dll
<br/> 
<br/>crashrpt\lib
<br/>crashrpt.lib </p>

<p>crashrpt\src
<br/>[all source files...]Linking against the libraryTo implicitly link against the library, you need to include the crashrpt.h file and link in the crashrpt.lib file. I find it easiest to add the following two lines to my main application file. </p>

<p>#include &quot;[whateveryourpath]/crashrpt/include/crashrpt.h&quot;
<br/>#pragma comment(lib, &quot;[whateveryourpath]/crashrpt/lib/crashrpt&quot;)Figure 3 - Integrating CrashRpt with your application </p>

<p>Initializing the libraryThe library needs to be initialized before it will catch any exceptions. You do this by calling the Install method, usually from your main function. The Install method is detailed below. </p>

<p>//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>// Install
<br/>//    Initializes the library and optionally set the client crash callback and
<br/>//    set up the email details.
<br/>//
<br/>// Parameters
<br/>//    pfn         Client crash callback
<br/>//    lpTo        Email address to send crash report
<br/>//    lpSubject   Subject line to be used with email
<br/>//
<br/>// Return Values
<br/>//    If the function succeeds, the return value is a pointer to the underlying
<br/>//    crash object created.  This state information is required as the first
<br/>//    parameter to all other crash report functions.
<br/>//
<br/>// Remarks
<br/>//    Passing NULL for lpTo will disable the email feature and cause the crash 
<br/>//    report to be saved to disk.
<br/>//
<br/>CRASHRPTAPI 
<br/>LPVOID 
<br/>Install(
<br/>   IN LPGETLOGFILE pfn OPTIONAL,                // client crash callback
<br/>   IN LPCTSTR lpTo OPTIONAL,                    // Email:to
<br/>   IN LPCTSTR lpSubject OPTIONAL                // Email:subject
<br/>   );Figure 4 - The Install() function </p>

<p>All of the parameters are optional. The first parameter is a pointer to a crash callback function defined as: </p>

<p>// Client crash callback
<br/>typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *LPGETLOGFILE) (LPVOID lpvState);Figure 5 - Client crash callback </p>

<p>You would define this callback only if you wanted to be notified of an application failure, so that you could perform some basic clean up (i.e. close db connections, attempt to save, etc). Otherwise, you can simply pass NULL for this parameter. </p>

<p>The second parameter defines the email address you want the crash report mailed to, or NULL if you prefer the reports be saved to the user&#39;s workstation. </p>

<p>The third parameter is the subject line used in the generated mail message. </p>

<p>The Install function returns a pointer to the underlying object that implements the real functionality of this library. This value is required for all subsequent calls into the library. </p>

<p>If, after you have called Install, you decide to unhook the CrashRpt library, you would call Uninstall. </p>

<p>//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>// Uninstall
<br/>//    Uninstalls the unhandled exception filter set up in Install().
<br/>//
<br/>// Parameters
<br/>//    lpState     State information returned from Install()
<br/>//
<br/>// Return Values
<br/>//    void
<br/>//
<br/>// Remarks
<br/>//    This call is optional.  The crash report library will automatically 
<br/>//    deinitialize when the library is unloaded.  Call this function to
<br/>//    unhook the exception filter manually.
<br/>//
<br/>CRASHRPTAPI 
<br/>void 
<br/>Uninstall(
<br/>   IN LPVOID lpState                            // State from Install()
<br/>   );Figure 6 - The Uninstall function </p>

<p>You would only ever call Uninstall if you decided, after calling Install, that you did not want the CrashRpt library to intercept exceptions. So, basically you will probably never call this method directly. </p>

<p>Adding custom files to the reportThe client application can, at any time, supply files to be included in the crash report by calling the AddFile function. </p>

<p>//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>// AddFile
<br/>//    Adds a file to the crash report.
<br/>//
<br/>// Parameters
<br/>//    lpState     State information returned from Install()
<br/>//    lpFile      Fully qualified file name
<br/>//    lpDesc      Description of file, used by details dialog
<br/>//
<br/>// Return Values
<br/>//    void
<br/>//
<br/>// Remarks
<br/>//    This function can be called anytime after Install() to add one or more
<br/>//    files to the generated crash report.
<br/>//
<br/>CRASHRPTAPI

<p>This is useful when your application uses or produces external files such as initialization files or log files. When a report is generated, it will include these additional files. Manually generating a report </p>

<p>You can force report generation by calling the GenerateErrorReport. This is useful if you want to provide an easy way to gather debugging information about your application to help debug a non-fatal bug. </p>

<p>Generate debug symbolsTo get the most out of the minidump, the debugger needs your application&#39;s debug symbols. By default release builds don&#39;t generate debug symbols. You can configure VC to generate debug symbols for release builds by changing a couple of project settings. </p>

<p>With the release build configuration selected, on the C/C++ tab under the General category, select &#39;Program Database&#39; under Debug info. </p>

<p>Figure 9 - C++ Project Settings </p>

<p>On the Link tab under the General category, check the &#39;Generate debug info&#39; option. Figure 9 - Link Project Settings </p>

<p>Now release builds will generate debug symbols in a PDB file. Keep all executables and PDB files for each release that ships to customers. You will need these files to read minidump files in the debugger. </p>

<p>Using the Crash ReportUsing the Crash LogThe crash log is an XML file that describes details about the crash including the type of exception, the module and offset where the exception occurred, as well as some cursory operating system and hardware information. I wrote the crash log to make it easier to catalog crashes. A crash can be uniquely identified by the module, offset and exception code. This information could be inspected by a developer or an automated process, and compared against previously reported problems. If a match is found, the developer or automated process, could inform the user of the solution without having to debug the error again. </p>

<p>The log is divided into four different sections or nodes. The first node is ExceptionRecord we discussed earlier. </p>

<p>Figure 10 - ExceptionRecord Node </p>

<p>Next is the Processor node, which contains a little information about the user&#39;s CPU. </p>

<p>Figure 11 - Process Node </p>

<p>Next is the OperatingSystem node, which contains the user&#39;s operating system version information. </p>

<p>Figure 12 - OperatingSystem Node </p>

<p>Last is the Modules node. This node contains the path, version, base address, size, and time stamp for every module loaded by the deceased application. </p>

<p>Figure 13 - Modules Node </p>

<p>Using the Crash Dump FileThe crash dump file is a minidump created with the help of the DbgHelp DLL&#39;s MiniDumpWriteDump function. The minidump contains various information about the state of the application when the error occurred including the call stack, local variables, and loaded modules. For more on creating minidumps, check out Andy Pennell&#39;s article. </p>

<p>You can view minidump files in VS.NET or the WinDbg debugger. Because WinDbg is free, I&#39;ll use it in the following example. You can download WinDbg from here. I&#39;m using version 6.1.0017.0 in the example. </p>

<p>The sample application included with this article does nothing but generate a null pointer exception. I&#39;ll use the sample to generate a crash and demonstrate how to use the resulting minidump. </p>

<p>When you run the sample application, click on the bomb button to generate a null pointer exception, and save the resulting crash report. Then extract the crash.dmp file from the crash report, launch WinDbg, and open the crash dump by pressing CTRL+D. </p>

<p>Next, you need to set the symbol path for WinDbg with the .sympath command. Switch to the command window (ALT+1) and enter .sympath followed by a space followed by the semi-colon delimited list of directories to search. </p>

<p>.sympath c:\downloads\CrashRptTestFigure 14 - Setting the symbol path </p>

<p>Similarly you need to set the executable and source search paths with the .exepath and .srcpath commands. </p>

<p>.exepath c:\downloads\CrashRptTest
<br/>.srcpath c:\downloads\CrashRptTestFigure 15 - Setting the source and executable paths </p>

<p>The final step is to change the debugger context to the context record associated with the exception by entering the .ecxr command. </p>

<p>.ecxrFigure 15 - Setting the exception context record </p>

<p>If everything is configured correctly, you should now be able to walk the call stack, see local variables, and loaded modules. You can even have WinDbg highlight the offending line of code by double clicking the CrashRptTest frame in the Call Stack window (ALT+6). Note: The exact line number may be a little off due to linker optimizations. </p>

<p>Figure 16 - The Promised Land: Using WinDbg to Locate the Cause of a Null Pointer Exception </p>

<p>DeploymentThe CrashRpt library relies on a couple of redistributable libraries. To be sure the library has access to the required files, you can distribute the ZLib and DbgHelp I&#39;ve included. </p>

<p> Library  File Version  Description   CrashRpt.DLL  3.0.2.1  Crash report library   ZLib.DLL  1.1.3.0  ZLib compression library   DbgHlp.DLL  6.1.17.1  Microsoft debug help library  Figure 17 - Redistributable Libraries </p>

<p>What to ship and what to saveAs I mentioned earlier, to debug a crash you need not only the minidupmp file, but also the symbol and executable files that make up your application. When preparing a build to be released to clients, you should always save the exact executable modules you ship to clients, along with the corresponding debug symbols. This way when a crash report comes in, you will have the modules and debug symbols that the debugger will need to properly interpret the minidump. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve received several comments/inquiries about shipping debug builds or debug symbols. You should never ship debug builds or debug symbols as they will not only take up more space on your CD/download/client&#39;s workstation, but they will also make reverse engineering your code a trivial exercise. To be clear, what I&#39;m suggesting is modify your release build configuration so that it generates debug symbols, saving both the release builds of your modules and their corresponding debug symbols in your source control system and delivering only the release builds of your modules to clients (as you do today). When a crash report comes in, you use the release build and debug symbols you archived, along with the minidump included in the crash report, to debug the crash. </p>

<p>Note: CrashRpt uses Microsoft&#39;s Debug Help library (dbghelp.dll). This library was shipped with Windows XP, but certain versions are redistributable. I recommend you to install the dbghelp.dll file, included in the source/demo attachments, along the crashrpt.dll into your application&#39;s directory to avoid the possible conflict or missing dependency issues.. A word about preferred base load addresses </p>

<p>Every executable module (EXE, DLL, OCX, whatever) has a preferred base load address. This is the address in the application&#39;s process space that the loader will try to map that module. If two or more modules list the same base load address, the loader will be forced to relocate the modules until each module loads at a unique address. Not only does this slow down the start up time of your application, but it also makes it impossible to debug fatal exceptions. In order to use the minidump file, you must ensure that your application&#39;s modules do not collide. You can use rebase.exe or manually override the preferred base load address for each conflicting module. Either way you need to make sure that your application modules always load at the same address for the minidump file to be useful. You can find more information about this in John Robbin&#39;s April 1998 MSJ column. </p>

 title : The crest Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CREST is an automatic test generation tool for C. </p>

<p>It works by inserting instrumentation code (using CIL) into a target program to perform symbolic execution concurrently with the concrete execution.  The generated symbolic constraints are solved (using Yices) to generate input that drive the test execution down new, unexplored program paths. </p>

<p>CREST currently reasons symbolically only about linear, integer arithmetic.  CREST should be usable on any modern Linux system.  It is usable on recent Mac OS X versions, as well, although some small modifications are needed for the code to build. </p>

<p>For further building and usage information, see the README file.  You may also want to check out the FAQ. </p>

<p>Further questions?  Contact Jacob Burnim (jburnim at cs dot berkeley dot edu) or e-mail the  CREST-users mailing list (CREST-users at googlegroups.com). </p>

 title : The crusty Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>C.R.US.T.Y.a.k.a. &#39;Consoles &#39;r us- thank you!&#39;Tools for Travelers to the TextyverseThere are many  excellent console-based tools and CRUSTY packages lots of them together into one convenient make file that includes  config files, installers,  tools and tips to make best use of: </p>

<p>svn w3m screen snownews midnight commander   emacs, vim, or even nano (if you are so inclined) bash On install, CRUSTY&#39;s  files are placed under $(DESTDIR)/opt/crusty/xyz  </p>

<p>so its easy to uninstall CRUSTY.    Not currently included, but coming soon, is support for: </p>

<p>script-based XML tools dot mutt latex gnuplot procmail Good old-fashioned UNIX  text processing languages like m4, gawk, etc And all those other neat tools for text mode.  </p>

<p>Why CRUSTY?But why travel to the textyverse? Well, maybe you never left it: </p>

<p>Despite decades of construction of more elaborate tools, 80% of the documents in most organizations aren&#39;t organized any better than plain old text files.  So, reality check, we already live in the textyverse. And that&#39;s a very good thing: </p>

<p>text is configurable :   automation is possible as per your requirements (use of Perl/ Ruby/ Rexx/ Python/ Gawk/ shell scripting/ etc/ etc) text is inter-operable : look at the amazing success of XML and RSS; text works anywhere : with an xterm or putty, you can rule the world from  at any coffee shop or trailer park; text is accessible : to  folks with visual impairment. text tools are mature : midnight commander, emacs, vim, screen, all those wonderful UNIX version control tools, etc etc etc; text is fast :  using commands from command line is faster than gui-ing. low bandwidth, roars down those internet pipes into, say, PDAs- which can be  crucial in crisis situations;  best of all,  text looks so dull : so  no one   pollutes the textyverse with garish eye-candy (read pop-up ads)  so no  brain decay (but it may cause cancer of the semi-colon).    </p>

<p>Too Many MetaphorsAnd we aren&#39;t the only ones to sing the praises of the textyverse.  Neil Stephenson argues in  &#39;In the beginning was the command line&#39; that: </p>

<p>By doing everything with GUIs rather than simply words,  we are  limiting ourselves.      Working at command line level --working with words -- is completely different from working with GUIs, and Stephenson is concerned with what is lost in the transition.   When we are buying a GUI-focussed operating system: What we&#39;re really buying is a system of metaphors. And -- much more important -- what we&#39;re buying into is the underlying assumption that metaphors are a good way to deal with the world.  </p>

<p>To be sure, there are limits to Stephenson&#39;s argument: </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Ultimately, there is no escape from metaphors. What we see and do is constrained by the tools used to look and touch. And those tools have their own ghosts:  e.g.  The UNIX textyverse is governed but its own metaphors  in particular: pipe-and-filter.     From a usability perspective, many users would thank you for... Building them a  simple environment that succinctly supports their standard work cliches.  </p>

<p>Of course our GUI metaphors are more restrictive than the textyverse... We&#39;ve only been using them for a decade or three.  We should not stop research into fledging ideas like the guiverse... ...Merely  because  other paradigms are centuries older and have more productive tools  The Dizzy Heights of TextyverseWhat is true is that it is much harder to  program the guiverse than the textyverse.  </p>

<p>Sure, the textyverse learning curve can be shallow (takes a long time to reach a high level of expertise)  But the learning curve goes much higher in the textyverse than the guiverse  And don&#39;t give me no grief about  intensive visual environments being inherently more productive than the textyverse.  Bah! Humbug!  Yes, the guiverse is more motivating for beginers. But the guiverse isn&#39;t    necessarily more productive for power users. For example,  </p>

<p> The UNIX metaphors encourage the rapid construction of ensembles of tools not monolithic packages but large libraries of tiny tools that can be quickly wired together to perform novel tasks And those ensembles can create a different user environment that support a very different style of inter-action So the UNIX metaphors let you quickly define and deploy new metaphaors Something that is very hard to do given the strict rules and restrictions of the  guiverse&#39;s padded playground. For another example, </p>

<p>In the guiverse we can only see specific instances (e.g. a directory called &#39;home&#39;). But in the textyverse we can build abstractions (e.g. replace a specific concept like &#39;tim&#39; with &#39;x of type person&#39;). Then we can write functions that work for all &#39;person&#39;s, not just &#39;tim&#39;.  So in textyverse we can reason about abstractions,  and abstractions about abstractions  and abstractions about abstractions about... (Help! Blacking out! Not enough oxygen up here!)    </p>

<p>Its time for my pill now </p>

<p>Sure, the above is a little  close to the edge and OTT and but, heh, it was  fun to write.  </p>

<p>And what would have happened, I wonder, if Jobs and Gates had taken that wrong turn at Albuquerque, missed Xerox PARC, and ended up in Bell Labs in the 1990s. Would everyone be using Acme instead of the guiverse? </p>

<p>Anyway... </p>

 summary : <p>About Crystal Crystal is a static analysis framework built as an Eclipse plugin. It&#39;s primary goals are to teach students about static analysis and to provide a way for researchers to prototype analyses. </p>

<p>You may create new analyses by extending Crystal with another Eclipse plugin. Crystal supports features such as branch-sensitivity, annotation extraction, exceptional control flow, and three address code. The classes used in Crystal are based on the abstractions of lattices and flow functions, thus making it easy to go from a formally defined analysis to a prototype. </p>

<p>DocumentationWe now have Javadocs of the Crystal APIs. </p>

<p>Tutorial at ECOOP 2009The tutorial &quot;Crystal–izing Sophisticated Code Analyses&quot; has been accepted to ECOOP 2009! If you&#39;d like a hands-on experience using Crystal, please meet us at ECOOP 2009 from July 6-10 in Genova, Italy. Our tutorial will be aimed at both educators who would like to use Crystal in the classroom and researchers who would like to write their own Crystal analyses. </p>

 summary : <p>DotNetNuke is an open source web application framework ideal for creating, deploying and managing interactive web, intranet and extranet sites. It is very well supported, just take a look at snowcovered.com. Unfortunately, VB and C# programmers don&#39;t cooperate as best they should, and take a mutually exclusive choice between the languages. This is unfortunate because DotNetNuke is a very well developed framework for ASP.NET that a lot of C# programmers do not want to look at. In an attempt to open it up to a wider audience, we have converted the VB code into C#. Today, Oct. 28, 2006 we have released the first successful build in C#. Please support the authors at DotNetNuke.com for their work, and report bugs in the C# code base to us. To avoid forking the code, we will only update the code when a new release of the VB code. </p>

<p>2007-0607: Here we grow again. Jule Bostick has been added as a member to the team. He brings with him 5+ years of professional ASP.NET development. Welcome aboard. Aside from that, I will be updating a lot of fixed I&#39;ve made to the code over the past few months including javascript errors, client api, and adsi membership modules.  </p>

<p>2007-03-31: The project welcomes Jason Thomas, who has picked up my slack and was finally able to get it to load and run for the most part. He&#39;s still getting am still getting null exceptions from many of the modules and invalid type errors in some some areas. But with his energy to the being brought to the team, I&#39;ll re-establish my interest and work with him and finish the conversion once and for all. Thanks to Jason everybody!  </p>

<p>2007-01-22: Updated to v4.4.0; now time to debug. </p>

<p>2007-01-12: updated to v4.3.7; next is 4.4.0 </p>

<p>2007-01-11: updated to v4.3.6 </p>

<p>2007-01-07: finished updating the trunk from v4.3.4 to v4.3.5. It has also been tagged under tags/v4.3.5. </p>

<p>2007-01-06: Just tagged v4.3.4 as a workable solution. Please report all issues with the project here. In the mean time I will be updating the code base up to 4.4.0 and then come back and fix all the issues you post here. </p>

 summary : <p>csEXWB is a C# .NET 2.0 control that creates, hosts and sinks the events of the original Webbrowser control (Not .NET or any other wrapper). Advanced customization and total control over the Webbrowser control are achieved via implementation of a number of interfaces, along with the addition of many methods, properties, events and a COM library. </p>

<p>Here are some of the features of this control: </p>

<p>Can easily be extended by adding other interfaces and methods, unlike .NET or any other Webbrowser wrapper  All the basics expected from a Webbrowser wrapper are implemented Setting/getting UI, and DL control flags Handling of context menus, keyboard, registry, security manager, script errors, popups, authentication, security problems, font size, messageboxes, file downloads Monitor HTTP and HTTPS request and response headers for all resources, images, sounds, scripts, etc, with the opportunity to add your own headers When a resource has been fully downloaded and read by MSHTML engine Built in onload and onunload events for top level and any frames/iframes Frameset aware. All the relevant routines check for frames Full drag and drop support Perform automation tasks, click button, check radio, select list items,... Load HTML content specifying BaseURL Use the control as an MSHTML editor MSHTML as a UI-less HTML parser helper class Has no dependencies on MSHTML interop. All of the interfaces, enums and structs are defined within the project A comprehensive demo that demonstrates how to use most of the functionality offered by this control beyond the basics. </p>

<p>An HTTP and HTTPS request and response header viewer A complete DOM viewer. Multi tab simulation. Cookies and Cache viewer and remover, per site or all, File download status viewer. Retrieve information from document object. An HTML editor with edit, source, and preview panes.

 summary : <p>CSS Redundancy CheckerA simple script that, given a CSS stylesheet and either a .txt file listing URLs of HTML files, or a directory of HTML files, will iterate over them all and list the CSS statements in the stylesheet which are never called in the HTML. </p>

<p>Basically, it helps you keep your CSS files relevant and compact. And it&#39;s reasonably accurate. </p>

<p>Usagecss-redundancy-checker.rb [cssfile] [directory of html files OR .txt file listing urls to use]Requirementsyou&#39;ll need Rubygems and Hpricot, plus a reasonably up-to-date version of Ruby (built on 1.8.5; should be fine on at least 1.8.4). </p>

<p>More detailed instructions (if the above wasn&#39;t clear enough)First, you&#39;ll need Ruby and Rubygems installed. That&#39;s left as an exercise for the reader. </p>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll need the Hpricot gem: </p>

<p>sudo gem install hpricot	 Pick the most recent version for your OS (mswin32 for Windows, ruby for anything else) </p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve got all that, you should be set. Now, get the redundancy checker script (or update it to the latest version): </p>

<p>svn checkout http://css-redundancy-checker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ css-redundancy-checker	 Navigate to the directory you&#39;ve checked the code out to. Then, it&#39;s just a case of doing this: </p>

<p>ruby css-redundancy-checker.rb [cssfile] [directory of html files OR .txt file listing urls to use]	 The first argument should be a CSS file. The second argument should EITHER be a directory, containing HTML files, or a .txt file with one URL per line for an HTML file. The script will process all the relevant files, and at the end, list any CSS statements which are not relevant to ANY of the HTML files. </p>

<p>NotesThe script will NOT work with incomplete HTML files (eg: template components, partial fragments, etc). You should only use it on complete HTML, either in the form of flat files, or rendered output from your web application. </p>

 summary : <p>Current Version - 0.6.2Javascript and Actionscript 3 code to enable a custom made right-click events in Flash / Flex. </p>

<p>ReferencesThis solution is integrated into Adobe Captivate 4 as a default method for capturing right click events in Actionscript3 / Flex based movies. </p>

<p>More information: http://blogs.adobe.com/captivate/2009/01/adding_rightclick_in_captivate_1.html </p>

<p>About The ProjectThe idea is fairly simple: </p>

<p>1-Use Javascript in the HTML container page to disable the right-click on top of the SWF. </p>

<p>2-Capture the event and pass it to a function that communicates with Flash via the External Interface </p>

<p>3-In Actionscript the function called from Javascript does whatever you need to display your own custom context-menu. </p>

 title : The custom-field-error Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>custom_field_error allows you to easily setup custom HTML to be displayed when there is a validation issue with a form. You can setup a different view for every model, or setup a view in one model and have that view be used as the default for all the other models. You can also explicitly override the default view you have chosen by defining another view within another model. Last but not least, you can choose to leave the Rails default view for whatever models you want. </p>

<p>It sounds like a lot, but it&#39;s actually very simple. Just put the following line in your model, in this case a User model: </p>

<p>custom_field_error &quot;?</p>

<p>Unknown end tag for </p>

<p>&quot; </p>

<p>Now, if there was an error on a field called &quot;name&quot; in a form, it would look like: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, this custom view would only be for the User view. To make this view the default view, simply set the second argument to &#39;default&#39;: </p>

<p>custom_field_error &quot;?</p>

<p>Unknown end tag for </p>

<p>&quot;, &#39;default&#39; </p>

<p>However, what if I now want to set a special view for my Project model? Simple. Just set custom_field_error like usual and it&#39;ll override the default view: </p>

<p>custom_field_error &quot;?&quot; </p>

<p>Voila! The plugin will automatically figure out what view it needs to display and display it. </p>

<p>Enjoy. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. </p>

 title : The custom-xml-serialization Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>CustomXMLSerialization is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that allows you more freedom in how your model objects are serialized using the to_xml method in ActiveRecord::XmlSerialization.  Your ActiveRecord subclasses can specify a complete custom serialization, without having to override to_xml in each object. </p>

<p>You can specify exactly which fields to include in a serialization, apply custom tag names, enclose data in CDATA constructs, and unwrap superfluous second-level associations into more brief first-level fields. </p>

 title : The cwin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Cwin的全称为Core Window，适用与JDK1.5+。对于已有系统，Cwin是一个便捷实用的CRUD插件。可以嵌入在任何支持Servlet的Java Web应用中。对于中小型应用而言，Cwin可作为系统的基础架构。Cwin可以大大减少简单繁杂的劳动，从而将精力放在核心业务的开发上来。因为使用Cwin完成功能将不需要编写任何的代码(XML配置除外)。 Cwin的核心概念是Window。那么，什么是一个Window呢？比如一个User的查询与编辑功能就可以配置为一个Window。这个Window将可以完成User的CURD操作。包含查询、排序、分页展示、验证等等完备的功能。 </p>

<p>Cwin的目的，为了使Java的Web开发人员能从简单繁杂的劳动中解脱出来。比如单表操作、简单的基础数据维护操作、数据查询操作。我们都知道这些功能都很简单，但是麻雀虽小，五脏（CRUD四个操作、加上验证、分页、查询等等）俱全，这些工作是系统中是很让人头疼的部分，因为大部分代码都在COPY或者使用代码生成器生成。开发人员哼哧哼哧弄完之后还得对功能进行各种测试。而Cwin力图使这些操作完全地自动化。事实上，现在Cwin已经可以在不写入任何代码的情况下自动配置好这些功能。 </p>

<p>Cwin很便捷:集成Cwin所需要的代价仅仅是引入jar包与资源文件，配置好Servlet与数据源就可以使用了。 </p>

<p>为什么说Cwin是一个实用的CRUD插件呢？ 我知道现在的CRUD框架生成的代码大都比较简陋，比如说遇到长字段一个表格会被撑开，录入界面只是简单的输入框，验证功能较弱... Cwin允许长字段值隐藏在表格中，在需要时可pop或以其它方式出来。 Cwin也支持录入控件的配置，支持下拉列表、文本域、还集成了当前最流行的fckeditor... Cwin支持的指定字段的查询与排序。支持数据库透明的物理翻页。 Cwin支持主从表的常规维护操作。 Cwin有很好的灵活性。 Cwin的编辑页面与表格都可以作为一个单独的模块进行引用。 ...... </p>

<p>最重要的是，完成这些工作不需要写任何的代码。只需要配置一个XML的文件。 </p>

<p>Cwin有一些比较小但非常重要的功能。 </p>

<p>1.比如说我们的用户类型在数据库中存储为数字，但我们要在表格中显示用户类型的描述。对，Cwin自动就会这么干。当然必须要为我们的用户类型配置下拉列表。下拉列表可以是固定的也可以是一个SQL查询的结果。 </p>

<p>2.如果您经常在项目中把某个下拉列表或在线编辑器在各个要使用他的页面中来回COPY。Cwin可以把这些资源统一管理。使用时只需要定义一个属性(如</p>

<p>)即可。 </p>

<p>3.允许表格显示展示数据以外的列，并支持动态URL。这样我们通过URL可以把不同的Window串起来。因为Window的各页面都可以通过URL来到达。 </p>

<p>4.允许Window动态接收参数作为window的条件与默认值，这样大大地加大了Window的灵活性。 </p>

<p>5.Cwin支持系统变量的插入。比如记录的创建时间，修改时间。当然用户也可以自定义系统变量。 </p>

<p>6.如果您使用Cwin。那么Cwin的配置文件可以作为一份不错的数据库文档。因为修改的每一个字段都必须修改配置文件才能得到体现。这样，这份文档总是最新的！ </p>

<p>Cwin的缺陷： 由于界面是自动生成，对于生成界面的美化，可以通过CSS替换。但这也有一定的限制。 所以就目前而言，Cwin用于角落里的小应用或内部人员使用的后台。是非常有帮助的。 </p>

<p>Cwin包含的组件： </p>

<p>1.Cwin包含一个基于泛型的强大JDBC工具包。提供了基于注释的简洁的事务控制器。提供了一个通用的DAO，它拥有一系列实用的方法，并包含一个数据库无关的分页查询方案。 </p>

<p>2.Cwin包含一个通用的JavaScript验证API与表单自动验证API。（目前已提供下载） </p>

 title : The cwpfsamples Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In an attempt to help others use the Microsoft Patterns and Practices Composite WPF framework (formerly Prism) this project aims to provide samples relating to usage of the framweork. </p>

<p>All examples given within this project are not meant to be used as real world projects but server as an example of how to solve common and not so common problems within real world projects. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve now migrated source and history from subversion to mercurial, follow these instructions to obtain the source. </p>

<p>Late Night 0.4 Now AvailableWell folks it&#39;s the first build of Late Night that I&#39;ve made, and keeping with the samples name it&#39;s currently 4:50am while I write this. I hope you get a bit out of this application even it it&#39;s just a little. Please by all means let me know what you think. It&#39;s very similar to Product Prism, I wanted to rewrite Product Prism to remove references to the company I work for as you may already be aware of. </p>

<p>Some new features you will find that were not in Product Prism are </p>

<p>A new login screen that demonstrates how one might implement a login screen. Use admin for the username and pass for the password when the application starts up (this is written on the dialog itself). A new splash screen demonstrating how one might show a borderless window with a progress bar and message text while the application starts. I haven&#39;t perfected this yet as I need a way for modules to register messages as they are starting up, the problem I&#39;m facing is that modules must be started on the UI thread which is not practicle for sending messages to this dialog. An about screen that can be found from Help&gt;About which demonstrates presenting IModule data for modules found from the applications IModuleEnumerator. I&#39;d like to extend this further by getting some of the assembly information which could be useful in order to show the assembly version and an icon if it exists. Document model has been enhanced to provide feedback via events for opening/closing documents, a cancellable event can be used while closing a document which will abandon a close operation. Any System.Windows.FrameworkElement object can be used for a document view, it no longer needs to be a System.Windows.Controls.UserControl. Tabs now have a close button with functionality that reflects the IE7 tabbed browsing mechanism. A new use-case module has been used to replace the LinePlanModule from Product Prism. This new module represents a common &quot;Notes&quot; interface where notes can be created/deleted/edited. This module extends on the LinePlanModule by </p>

<p>Providing a better static service implementation Providing a &quot;New&quot; command to create new notes. Allowing a user to &quot;Delete&quot; a note. I will be extending this module at a later date to provide user feedback by preventing a close if the note has not been saved. I will also provide a mechanism for notes to be serialized by a pluggable persistence mechanism (DB/WS/File). </p>

<p> </p>

<p>NoticeI&#39;m working on a new project called LateNight, this project is a reiteration of ProductPrism but is a rewrite for several reasons, one being for the new Microsoft.Practices.Composite libraries for Composite WPF. </p>

<p>Late Night has a lot of new features that Product Prism doesn&#39;t, such as </p>

<p>An about box: that demonstrates how to present the user with currently loaded mosules A login screen: demonstrating how and where you could present the user with a dialog asking for credentials. A splash screen: Showing one possible way of handling a splash screen, this does not currently support feedback from other modules though I am looking at ways for this to be handled. </p>

<p>Check out the late night solution from the mercurial source repository. </p>

<p>Mercurial AccessIf you&#39;re new to mercurial and are wondering how to check-out the source-code take a look at Mercurial. </p>

<p>Looking for SupportI&#39;d love to hear what others are doing, please feel free to communicate with me on the issues section for any issues relating to the project or through the groups hosted at the Composite WPF site for general Composite WPF discussion. </p>

<p>Disclaimer I &quot;Brett Ryan&quot;, as the originator of this project am new to all areas of what this project is trying to acheive and hope that I can gather positive feedback and support on how I have solved some of the problems presented.</p>

 title : The d-phoenix Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>基于 D 2.0 + druntime，编译器推荐 DMD 2.0 最新版本(注意:目前 d-phoenix 仅兼容 Windows ，其他平台暂未列入计划中)。 </p>

<p>初始版本 0.5.1 推荐使用 DMD 2.019，因为这个版本还没有移植到 druntime 上。 如果想要体验 druntime ，请使用 DMD 2.021 或 DMD 2.0 最新版本并 Check out 最新版本。 </p>

<p>老实说，我也不知道这个项目会做到什么地步。 现在已经完成常见数据结构，并发布初始版本 0.5.1。 并行/并发这块设计还没想好，可能会对 Thread 有些增改。 已经有了些概念，而且也做了些封装。 </p>

<p>在做完数据结构这块，接下来会做一些国际化的准备。 因为线程是带有区域信息的，先做这些对以后的工作能提供莫大的便利。 </p>

<p>目前在线程提供支持方面，仅仅实现 Windows 平台，并且优先考虑支持 Windows 平台，不过同时也保留了其他平台实现的接口，且有些函数已经兼容 Linux平台。 </p>

<p>数据结构是平台独立的。 </p>

<p>关于性能：只举一例，当年 STL 出世的时候，着实嘲笑了 C 库的 qsort 一把。本人也很自豪的说，d-phoenix 项目的排序功能性能完全可以媲美 STL 的 sort 函数。不客气的说，只高不低，哇哈哈~ </p>

This program scans all mp3s in a folder and will properly format the ID3 tags so that album art is displayed on the Dare.  If album art isn&#39;t present, the program automatically attempts to retrieve it from amazon, seamless to the user.  Also, tracks of an album on the Dare are listed in alphabetical order which contradicts what most people are used to when listening to cds.  This program also fixes the names of the songs so they show up in the proper order. </p>

<p>How to UseConnect your phone or sd card as a usb mass storage device. Copy your mp3&#39;s to my_music Run DareMusicFixer Click go, select your my_music folder Your music will be properly tagged for album track order, and album art will be downloaded from amazon if not already present.  If the art cannot be found, or a tag is missing, an edit tag dialog will appear, where you can modify the name of the album, artist, track, and track number. When the process completes, load up my music on your phone and enjoy a more organized music player!

If experience shows that some of the features are useful, they may be included in the vanilla Darkstar by its developers. Individual features can be enabled and disabled by editing the darkstar-exp.properties file. </p>

<p>The project files are available in Maven format in a Maven repository (see MavenIntegration). </p>

<p>If you wish to contribute to Darkstar EXP, contact the project owner (username@gmail.com). You should provide a patch for your modifications and unit tests which verify the new functionality. You will then get write access to the source repository so that you can maintain your own features. </p>

 summary : <p>UPDATE: Moved to GitHubhttp://github.com/adzap/date_time_text_field_helpers </p>

<p>No more updates will be submitted here. </p>

<p>DescriptionThis Ruby on Rails plugin provides a set of form helpers for dates and time that output text fields for each date/time component instead of the select dropdowns which the standard date helpers use. It can make for more efficient data entry using the keyboard. It uses the rails built-in multi-parameter handling the same as the date select helpers do. </p>

<p>It is best combined with a plugin like validates_date_time (http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/rails/plugins/validates_date_time/) to do the date and time validation for you. The standard rails date helpers rely on the limited options in the dropdowns to avoid the need for proper date validation. But see what happens when you enter 30th February and notice that it silently becomes a date in March. </p>

<p>It also allows you to add some javascript behaviours to handle  auto-tabbing between components when filled. There is a demo in the plugin which uses LowPro from Dan Webb. </p>

<p>ExampleThe helpers return the date parts as text fields i.e. </p>

<p>date_text_field :person, :date_of_birth, :order =&gt; [:day, :month, :year], :blank =&gt; truereturns this for a new person record </p>

 summary : <p>Active ObjectThis is a simple example of the Active Object concurrency pattern.  Example code is provided in both Ruby and Java. </p>

<p>See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Object </p>

<p>This is intended to be used in my talk on Active Object at the Melbourne Patterns group http://melbournepatterns.org/ </p>

<p>The example is a contrived one of a domain name reseller selling .com, .com.au, and .co.nz domain names with the restriction that the respective domain name registries (or registrars) only allowing one connection at a time from the reseller. </p>

<p>Note that I assume a really simple FIFO scheduler and so do not supply a queue iterator on the Activation Queue, instead I just supply a dequeue method to take the first item off the queue, blocking if the queue is empty. </p>

<p>Directory structure:   </p>

<p>- examples: contains example usage  in ruby of the classes defined in the other directories. 
<br/>  - classic: contains ruby classes needed for a classic implementation of Active Object where each &quot;active object&quot; consists 
<br/>of a proxy (ActiveDomainNameRegistry) that has a reference to a single servant (DomainNameRegistry), 
<br/>and a single scheduler (Scheduler), and the scheduler contains a single activation queue (ActivationQueue). 
<br/>   - variation: contains a variation (in ruby) of the pattern that allows multiple servants per activation queue 
<br/>and is avoids being tied to a single type of servant by using method_missing.

 title : The db-dump Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionThis tool is used for dump and restore database of Django. And it can also support some simple situations for Model changes, so it can also be used in importing data after the migration of Model. </p>

<p>It includes: dump and restore. </p>

<p>DumpCommand Line: </p>

<p>    python db_dump.py [-svdh] [--settings] dump [applist]If applist is ignored，then it means that all app will be dumped. applist can be one or more app name. </p>

<p>Description of options: </p>

<p>-s Output will displayed in console, default is writing into file -v Display execution infomation, default is does not display -d Directory of output, default is datadir in current directory. If the path is not existed, it&#39;ll be created automatically. -h Display help information. --settings settings model, default is settings.py in current directory.  It can only support Python format for now. It&#39;ll create a standard python source file, for example: </p>

<p>    dump = {&#39;table&#39;: &#39;tablename&#39;, &#39;records&#39;: [[...]], &#39;fields&#39;: [...]} table&#39; is table name in database, records is all records of the table, it&#39;s a list of list, that is each record is a list. fields` is the fields name of the table. </p>

<p>Load(Restore)Command Line: </p>

<p>    python db_dump.py [-svdrh] [--settings] load [applist]You can refer to the above description for same option. Others is: </p>

<p>-r Does not empty the table as loading the data, default is empty the table first then load the data  Using this tool, you can not only restore the database, but also can deal with the simple changes of database. It can select the suitable field from the backup data file according to the changed Model automatically, and it can also deal with the default value define in Model, such as default parameter and auto_now and auto_now_add parameter for Date-like field. And you can even edit the backup data file manually, and add a default key for specify the default value for some fields, the basic format is: </p>

<p>    &#39;default&#39;:{&#39;fieldname&#39;:(&#39;type&#39;, &#39;value&#39;)}default is a dict, the key will be the field name of the table, the value will be a two element tuple, and the first element of this tuple is type field, the second element is its value. Below is a description of type field: </p>

<p>Type  Value  Description   &#39;value&#39;  real value  using the value field directly   &#39;reference&#39;  referred field name  the value of this filed will use the value of referred field. It&#39;ll be used when the field name is changed   &#39;date&#39;  &#39;now&#39;|&#39;yyyy-mm-dd&#39;  It&#39;s a date date type, if the value field is &#39;now&#39;, then the value be current time. Otherwise, it&#39;ll be a string, it&#39;s format is &#39;yyyy-mm-dd&#39;   &#39;datetime&#39;  &#39;now&#39;|&#39;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss&#39;  The same as above   &#39;time&#39;  &#39;now&#39;|&#39;hh:mm:ss&#39;  The same as above  </p>

<p>The strategy of selection of default value of a field is: first, create a default value dict according the Model, then update it according the default key of backup data file. So you can see if there is a same definition of a field in both Model and backup data file, it&#39;ll use the one in backup data file. </p>

<p>According the process of default value, this tool will suport these changes, such as: change of field name, add or remove field name, etc. So you can use this tool to finish some simple update work of database. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t give it too much test, and my situation is in sqlite3. So download and test are welcome, and I hope you can give me some improve advices. </p>

 title : The dbmigrate Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DescriptionSimilar to &#39;rake migrate&#39; for Ruby on Rails this library lets you manage database upgrades for your Java applications. </p>

<p>SetupChoose a version table name for your database.  The default is db_version. Choose a package within which you will store all your classes and scripts for migrations. Create a directory within that package named after your database (in lowercase, e.g. mysql). Create a script in that directory named migrate0.sql and in that script create the version table and insert version 1, e.g: CREATE TABLE db_version (version integer not null) ENGINE=InnoDB;
<br/>INSERT INTO db_version VALUES (1);RuntimeBefore accessing your database in your programs you need to create a Migrate instance with the appropriate database configuration. Make sure the version is set to the version of the program accessing the database. Call migrate() on your Migrate instance to ensure that your client version matches the database version.  If you have enabled &#39;auto&#39; and don&#39;t specify a client version it will look at the database version it will scan for more recent migrations.  You have a few options for defining migrations.  As far as code they can be either Java, Groovy or SQL.  As far as version transition they can define either &#39;to&#39; or &#39;from&#39; flavors. The &#39;from&#39; flavor is used when you may want to skip versions while the &#39;to&#39; flavor is for when you want the target database version to be the same as the version number in script and don&#39;t mind the reduced flexibility.   Attempt to use a migration class: packageName + databaseName + &quot;.Migrate(To/From)&quot; + dbVersion If class in 1 not found, use a migration script: pacakge dir + &quot;/&quot; + databaseName + &quot;/migrate(to/from)&quot; + dbVersion + &quot;.sql&quot; If script in 2 not found, attempt to use a generic migration class: packageName + &quot;.Migrate(To/From)&quot; + dbVersion If class in 3 not found, use a generic migration script: pacakge dir + &quot;/migrate(to/from)&quot; + dbVersion + &quot;.sql&quot; It will return once the client version and database version are equal.  It will throw an exception if anything happens that stops that from being true. It is safe to run the migration from many different programs at the same time due to the locking that it does (in most databases).  It is also safe to run it multiple times. ImplementationAlways migrate before the first access to your database in a program Never upgrade a database in use without a strategy for discovering that its been upgraded Try to use generic DDL whenever you can if you expect to use more than one type of database with your application FutureDDL layer that understands different databases Integration with JPA and other data access frameworks LOC</p>

 title : The dbsprockets Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DBSprocketsThe goal of DBSprockets is to give the developer the power to simply generate web content from available database definitions.  Because DBSprockets relies heavily on Toscawidgets, it is framework-independent.  It is easy to implement forms on TG, TG2, Pylons, Zope, and Grok using DBSprockets&#39; primitives.  </p>

<p>DBSprockets is mainly supporting SQLAlchemy, so any application you have that uses  SQLAlchemy will be well supported.  Support for other ORMs will be available in the future. </p>

<p>Every component of DBSprockets is extensible so that the developer can override a form or a set of forms to his or her liking. </p>

<p>One of the important implementations using DBSprockets is DBMechanic, which acts as a control board for your database crud. </p>

<p>Current Version0.2.2, 0.5dev </p>

<p>more details. </p>

<p>DeclarativesDeclaratives are the easiest way to get going with DBSprockets. </p>

<p>FormBaseTake a look a the simplest example, a login form: </p>

<p>from dbsprockets.declaratives import FormBase
<br/>from myProject.myModel import User</p>

<p>class LoginForm(FormBase):
<br/>    __model__ = User
<br/>    __limit_fields__ = &#39;username&#39;, &#39;password&#39;</p>

<p>login_form = LoginForm()In your template, you would render the form like this: </p>

<p>${login_form()}Here is what the form looks like: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>More information about the model that created this form. </p>

<p>TableBaseAnd here is an example showing what it looks like to display a list of users: </p>

<p>from dbsprockets.declaratives import TableBase
<br/>from dbsprockets.primitives import get_table_value
<br/>from myProject import User
<br/>     
<br/>class UserTable(TableBase):
<br/>    __model__ = User</p>

<p>user_table = UserTable()
<br/>value = get_table_value(User)</p>

<p>user_table(value=value)Which when rendered through a web framework looks something like this: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Notice that the town name (Arvada) has been automatically added. </p>

<p>Extensible APIThe power of DBSprockets is that every part of it is extensible so customizing forms, widget templates and other portions of your database view is made easier.  Simply override the fields you want to change by name or type with what you want.  Want a whole set of sprockets that have the same modification?  No problem, create a Sprockets cache with your new defaults. </p>

 summary : <p>Easily customisable robust Debian boot CD scripts.  </p>

<p>Uses pbuilder (a standard tool) for creating the base system allows you to edit the base system (install more packages using apt-get, edit files...) creates an iso image (you can test it in qemu) after booting, it drops you into the busybox, with instructions how to proceed - you need to mount the cdrom (usb stick, whatever) manually (so that you can always boot it) boots the rest of the system automatically Why another Debian boot CD?There are other similar projects (see the links), however this project&#39;s motivation is: </p>

<p>simplicity: just a simple short bash script, doing things you would do by hand, if you wanted to create the boot CD (thus you can do it automatically but also you can modify it to suit your needs perfectly) robustness: you do all the vulnerable steps that can fail by hand (creating the base system, adding extra packages, locating the base.tar.bz2 after booting), so that you can always easily fix it and you can boot from all kinds of CDs and USB sticks, as long as you are able to mount the drive in the shell from the kernel, that you installed on the image See for yourself, browse the code from svn here. </p>

 title : The decide Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The solution for decision apathy! </p>

<p>Decide For Me was inspired by a common lunch scenario -- a bunch of software developers decide to go out for lunch, we all pile into the car, and then as we&#39;re driving out of the parking lot, someone says, &#39;where are we going?&quot;  And no one wants to make the decision between Chinese, Subway or Wendy&#39;s.  Been there?  I thought so. </p>

<p>So like any good software developer I realized we could solve our problems with code.  Enter decide-for-me.  This web app will decide any of your life&#39;s problems by providing a random answer. </p>

<p>But it gets better... </p>

<p>Since I couldn&#39;t decide what webapp framework to write it in, I decided to write a version in every web framework.  Well, not really.  But I&#39;m trying. </p>

<p>The real goal of Decide For Me is to provide a simple, yet not quite trivial web application which can be used for training and education purposes.  The hope is to implement the same simple website in as many web frameworks and languages as catch our fancy.  The code should be small enough to understand easily, but showcase enough as to let a developer get a decent feel for how a language or framework operates.  Ideally, one should be able to code-up a new version of Decide For Me within a day or maybe a weekend, even if trying out a completely new technology. </p>

<p>At the moment, the project starts with a Google App Engine version (the hosted version on decide-for-me.com) and a slightly dated Rails version.  Please feel free to use the code, comment on it, and provide improvements to make it more idomatic.  If you&#39;re interested in implementing a version of the site in your own favorite framework, that&#39;s great!  Check out the specification and how to help.</p>

 title : The demonine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DemoNine will be an open-source library, eventually with an IDE, for developing web-applications. These applications will require a server running Ruby 1.8, and clients with browsers supporting JavaScript 1.6 or later. Actually, the framework will also seamlessly render sites that work without Javascript, but there will be limited functionality where client side events are concerned. Namely, the only client-side events that will work without Javascript are onSubmit and onClick events. The good part is that DemoNine will handle Javascript-less clients automatically. We may figure out a work around for more events, like onFocus, but for the moment we are at a loss as to how to do this without Javascript. </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that the DemoNine framework will provide a high level of abstraction that will allow rapid software development similar to that of Java or C#--both with a plethora of built-in libraries. However, DemoNine&#39;s power is that it will unify all the common system layers in a web application--HTML, server-side scripting language, Javascript, MySQL, XML, etc. By &quot;unify&quot;, we mean eliminate all but a single language. </p>

<p>Best of all, elegance will be a driving force in the layout and implementation of the DemoNine framework. Frameworks that require excessive or repetitive coding in order to make new modules compliant with the framework&#39;s standards are not nearly as useful. Also, they make for clumbsy code that looks terrible. DemoNine will accomplish this elegance and simplicity by abstracting and exploiting some of the amazing core features available in Ruby. For example, think of the trace functions&#39; power. In this sense, think of DemoNine as an extension to the Ruby compiler--an extension to the Ruby language itself rather than simply a bunch of functions that you can call. </p>

<p>What does all this mean? Imagine being able to build a web application with Ruby in the exact same way you would build say a Qt application with Ruby. Programmers will be able to develop applications delivered through a web page in the exact same way they develop applications for Windows or Gnome Desktop. This is something many web applications already do, such as Amazon.com, GMail, Facebook, etc. But, the production frameworks used by those systems are not entirely available to the public, if at all, and they still do not eliminate the need for writing HTML, Javascript and annoying SQL statements. We know what you are thinking--&quot;That&#39;s witch craft!&quot;, or &quot;Hey, there is already a project that does that!&quot; If your thinking the latter, please send a link via e-mail so we can review the project. But we warn you, if it is not written in Ruby, it probably can&#39;t do what DemoNine can, and it certainly can&#39;t do it as elegantly. If it is Ruby or Ruby on Rails based, then it probably comes close to DemoNine, but still falls just a bit short. Nevertheless, send us the links. Our contact info is at the bottom of this page. </p>

<p>The first pre-alpha release of this framework (palpha 1.0) is slated to be released in the second quarter of 2008. The framework will contain support for the at least the following: </p>

<p>Event systems which will trigger system wide events which can call code via Javascript on the client side, in Ruby on the server side, or both. For example, an onClick event can trigger both Javascript functions and Ruby functions on the server-side. A function in Ruby can trigger functions in Ruby on the server or in Javascript on the client. Enough library tools to build a generic website with forms, tabbed forms, drop down menus, vertical menus, basic content management, etc. Ajax forms and UI controls that can be used and extended without ANY knowledge of Javascript or HTML at all! Ajax controls which can trigger events in the browser and on the server, such as deleting a record from list or changing the site theme, or even simply triggering a word count box to update it&#39;s display. Ajax data tables which can show generic data in rows and columns, similar to Ruby on Rails. Database abstraction layer which internally handles normalization and de-normalization of data automatically. Extendable libraries to customize and expand built in functionality, while maintaining the built in support for existing Ajax and event systems. User log in and account management, with group level permissions. The ability to nest groups within other groups, and put users in multiple groups in order to create an abstract ACL hierarchy. And, expect anything else we can get implemented by May of 2008.</p>

<p>Test out a theory of web development.  A simple observation that CS always thinks about encapsulation, and web development so often screws this up.  I think every single piece of this project should be a &quot;self&quot; rendering encapsulated component.  Every major table, every display, should be in a well behaved div that you can cram into anything with a reasonable set of parameters.  They should be generated and styled dynamically so that somebody can call components that return functional namespace &quot;objects.&quot;  You should be able to call a component and render it in a generic layout, or return HTML &amp; Javascript via ajax.  If you cannot, obviously you broke encapsulation.  Plus I think it will really help us not step on each others toes if you don&#39;t have to worry about somebody constantly screwing with the &quot;main&quot; layout page. ~Justin</p>

 summary : <p>Smart Debugger for Perl, Python, Ruby, FirebugIntroduction </p>

<p>Many programmers never touch the debugger. Because debugger is powerful 
<br/>but somewhat esoteric. It provides granular controls for the debugging, 
<br/>but failed on convenience. My goal for writing Smart Debugger is to 
<br/>provide convenience and usability features. </p>

<p>Debugger Usability </p>

<p>Many people are most comfortable with adding debugging variables and 
<br/>print statements to their code. These are fine techniques; I use them 
<br/>too, when they are appropriate. At other times, the debugger is more 
<br/>convenience to see what is going on right in front of your eyes and poke 
<br/>the code at the debugger prompt rather than having to modify the code 
<br/>and rerun it. </p>

<p>Debugger Dimensions </p>

<p>Dimension 1: Can somebody help me with this? The only time we reach for 
<br/>a debugger is when something goes wrong or breaks and our standard 
<br/>debugging techniques such as print statements (or better yet, log 
<br/>messages) do not reveal the root of the problem. The source code 
<br/>debugger runs code in a controlled manner. It allows stepping through a 
<br/>piece of code one line at a time, walking up and back down call trees, 
<br/>setting break points, and using the power of the Python shell for 
<br/>various levels of introspection and control. </p>

<p>Dimension 2: Hell is other people&#39;s code ? To mangle an old saying, with 
<br/>apologies to Sartre, &quot;Hell is other people&#39;s code.&quot; Other people think 
<br/>differently than I do; they use weird idioms, and sometimes their 
<br/>comments are incomprehensible. Invoking the debugger on someone&#39;s code 
<br/>is like having a conversation with the author. It opens the code to the 
<br/>questions I want answered, in real time--and there&#39;s another party in 
<br/>the conversation, the interpreter. The debugger makes it easy to try 
<br/>things out, even quicker than writing a one-liner, because the 
<br/>environment&#39;s already set up for the running program. 
<br/>Debugger vs Smart Debugger </p>

<p>Debugger offers the below controls. 
<br/>Smart Debugger offers the below convenience. </p>

<p>Data controls: setting watch expressions, commands to see the values in run time. convenience: data rendering to render only the variables in last exec line. Code window controls:see the execution line, commands to see the window around lines. convenience: always display the window around lines.   </p>

<p>Code markers controls: show the current execution line convenience: show the last/current execution line. </p>

<p>Stepping: controls: no default. decide step into/over. convenience: default is step into.</p>

 title : The devwisdom Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Dex is a programming language that combines C-like syntax and semantics with LISP-like macros, so it ought to be universally loathed.</p>

<p>Dex is an imperative, statically typed, compiled language. Its design was influenced by C, Ada, Java, C# and modern scripting languages (Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby), and to a lesser extent by LISP and OCaml.</p>

<p>Dex macros take a Dex parse tree as input and can modify that tree as the macro writer desires. Dex macros are written in Dex; the Dex standard library contains modules and classes useful for manipulating a Dex parse tree.</p>

<p>The philosophy behind Dex is to keep the core language as simple as possible, but to allow the language to be extended using macros. Complicated features such as generic programming, operator overloading or aspect-oriented programming can be built with Dex macros. It may be possible to use Dex macros to model programming features that otherwise would be completely alien to an imperative language; continuations, for instance.</p>

<p>Dex macros are similar to LISP macros, except that LISP macros are generally more powerful. LISP macros can affect a program at runtime, for instance, where Dex macros cannot.</p>

<p>Dex is also a &#39;safe&#39; language, in that it does not allow the usual culprits: There&#39;s no pointer arithmetic in Dex, nor unchecked conversion, and bounds checking on array accesses is mandatory.</p>

<p>Dex programs can use a garbage collector, but like Ada, the garbage collector is not required. Unlike Ada, Dex programs compile with a garbage collector by default; unlike most Ada compilers, the Dex compiler comes with the garbage collection library pre-installed.</p>

<p>The safety enforcements and garbage collection (if present) will impact the performance of a compiled Dex program when compared against a C or assembler program. However, unlike &#39;managed&#39; environments like Java or C#, and unlike the popular scripting environments such as Python, the overhead imposed by the Dex language is minimal.</p>

<p>Status: Dex is currently pre-alpha.  The parser is mostly complete, so the next step is to implement semantic anlaysis.</p>

In addition, dez offers a highly sophisticated API for implementing custom protocols, as well as a controller class that simplifies the creation of applications that require multiple servers to run in the same process.</p>
 title : The dfa-to-regularexpression-converter Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Written in Scheme, this converts DFAs to Regular Expressions. It will be either used in its current form as the backend for a site, or ported to javascript to run in a browser, or ported to some other language (F#, maybe?) to run as the backend for a site.</p>
 summary : <p>This project is for the JAVA version of DFBnc (Read below for delphi/pascal) </p>

<p>HistoryDFBnc was originally an IRC Bouncer written in Delphi. It compiled on Linux (FreePascal) and windows (using both Delphi and FreePascal). </p>

<p>DFBNC Was originally licensed under the ZLIB License, unfortunately this version had a number of bugs in it, and is no longer available. </p>

<p>NowDue to issues with the code and random other things, the decision was taken to completely rewrite DFBnc (for the 2nd time), and rather than relying on external librarys (lsocket and wsocket) and having to test on 3 compilers and work around the various differences in compilers/platforms by hand it was decided to be rewriten in Java, with the rock-solid IRC Parser from DMDirc] powering it. </p>

<p>CompatabilityConfig files between the 2 versions are not compatible with each other, due to the config-directory structure used by dfbnc-java. </p>

<p>External FilesDFBnc makes use of files from other projects, which are automatically downloaded when using svn. The projects used are: # DMDirc (irc parser) # DF Libs (cliparser and logger) </p>

<p>All 3 of the used parts are coded by me, but are part of other projects I am a developer for.</p>

 title : The dfgs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewDFL designer is a collection-oriented scientific workflow (COSW) tool based on DFL notation which combines established formalisms from workflow modeling and databases, namely Petri nets and nested relational calculus (NRC). COSW tools are used in applied sciences like bioinformatics where large amounts of structured data are processed with the use of specialized services that are made available online by scientific institutions. They make such data processing experiments easier to conduct by the experimentators and easier to repeat by the reviewers. The notations, models and techniques used in construction of such tools are similar to the ones known from workflow modeling, but additional emphasis is put on the data manipulation aspects, e.g., processing of nested collections of data. DFL designer not only allows to design and enact complicated workflows with the use of a huge library of supported bioinformatics services, but also provides a set of features for testing and analyzing workflow specifications that is unique for COSW, including but not limited to token game, hierarchical analysis and translation of hierarchical side-effect free workflows to NRC. Thus, DFL designer can be used to study in a COSW setting the usefulness of ideas well-tried in workflow modeling and databases. </p>

<p>Instructions, directions, materials, ...Several wiki pages are available for the project. They contain useful information and materials including: </p>

 title : The di-as3 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Developed for use with ActionScript 3, Flash 9 and Flex 2 projects it provides an inversion of control container for components that support dependency injection.  </p>

<p>Feature summary: Support for constructor and setter injection, with setter injection available to public variables, setter accessors, and methods. </p>

<p>Dependency resolution can be performed automatically through reflection or by providing:  </p>

<p>a subclass as a type-hint, a key string that a component was registered with, a function reference to return the dependency, a literal value. </p>

<p>Component instances can be cached allowing emulation of singleton access to instances. </p>

<p>The DI library can also detect some forms of cyclic dependency between components. </p>

<p>Support is included for managing instances created outside of the container. Once registered they are available to any component that requests an instance. Additionally registered instances can be populated by setter injection once, every time or never when retrieved from the container. </p>

<p>Runtime container configuration by XML is available, with additional formats easily added.  </p>

<p>Components can be registered in any order as they are only resolved when requested from the container. This allows for the loading of multiple external defintions and RSLs to load classes as required.  </p>

<p>A Reflection API is included in the DI library to address issues with the flash.utils.describeType function, and provides an API that makes the common use-cases of the DI library quick and easy.</p>

 summary : <p>This project aims to develop editor, that significantly simplifies annotation process of transcribed spoken dialog. Annotation process was developed to maximize inter-annotator agreement and annotation reliability. Editor helps an annotator to speed up annotation process and to correct their typos and semantic nonsense in annotations. </p>

<p>The editor was mainly used for in the project Extended HVS parser. </p>

<p>The used dialogue act and semantic annotation scheme is described in the chapter from my PhD thesis &quot;The human-human train timetable dialogue corpus&quot;. </p>

<p>There is annotation manual used to annotate the corpus (in Czech).  </p>

 title : The dieselblittingengine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introduction </p>

<p>With the Bitmap classes in Flash Player 9, developers now have the ability to utilize blitting and double-buffering techniques to create resource efficient gaming engines in the Flash Player. Diesel is a set of ActionScript 3 classes that provide a conveinent display engine to take advantage of these new player features. </p>

<p>Why should I care? </p>

<p>Diesel uses 1 bitmap to draw to vs. hundreds of MovieClips / Sprites. This results in a more scaleable engine, allowing for more moving sprites, lower usage of RAM &amp; Processor, and better refresh rates.</p>

 summary : <p>This project intent to provide an application that uses python-clamav library to integrate with ClamAV antivirus, and provide a template filter that check a a file for virus and saves this information, returning if that file can or not be downloaded. </p>

<p>Depends on pyClamAV and jQuery libraries to work. </p>

<p>How to use: </p>

<p>1. First you need to add the application to your INSTALLED_APPS setting; </p>

<p>2. Add the following node to your project urlpatterns: </p>

<p>(r&#39;^antivirus/&#39;, include(&#39;apps.antivirus.urls&#39;)),3. Considering you have an object called &quot;document&quot; that has a field &quot;file&quot; of FileField type, you shall follows this example: </p>

<p>{% load antivirus %}</p>

<p>{{ document|check_for_virus:&quot;file&quot; }}This will show a message like &quot;Wait for file checking...&quot; and make an Ajax request, returning the download link or message that found a virus depending on result. </p>

<p>The file scanning is made just once time, that is stored in database and used for next times.</p>

 title : The django-assetpackager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>When it comes time to deploy your new web application, instead of sending down a dozen javascript and css files full of formatting and comments, this Django Application makes it simple to merge and compress JavaScript and CSS down into one or more files, increasing speed and saving bandwidth. </p>

<p>When in development, it allows you to use your original versions and retain formatting and comments for readability and debugging. </p>

<p>Because not all browsers will dependably cache javascript and css files with query string parameters, AssetPackager writes a timestamp into the merged file names. Therefore files are correctly cached by the browser AND your users always get the latest version when you re-deploy. </p>

<p>This code is released under the MIT license. You’re free to rip it up, enhance it, etc. And if you make any enhancements, I’d like to know so I can add them back in. Thanks!</p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to Grappelli - a Django app that supports multiple blogs. It is currently compatible with Django 0.97 pre. </p>

<p>I&#39;m making some changes to the code for Django 1.0 compatibility. Stay tuned! </p>

<p>By the way, this app is currently being used by The Globe and Mail&#39;s new education website, GlobeCampus.ca -- http://www.globecampus.ca/blogs/freshman-life/. Check it out! </p>

<p>About This DocumentThis document includes instructions on installing the django-blogs app. The goal is to provide everything you need to know to get started on using django-blogs. </p>

<p>Note: This is an unfinished document. Holes are actively being filled. Please check back for regular updates. </p>

<p>DependenciesThe templates provided requires two Django apps to be loaded: django.contrib.humanize and django.contrib.markup. </p>

<p>Add the following to the INSTALLED_APPS variable in your project&#39;s settings.py module. </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    // ...
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.humanize&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.markup&#39;,
<br/>)The markup module is to enable Markdown formatting syntax in the comments. In order for it to work you need to make sure the markdown module is available in your PYTHONPATH. If you don&#39;t have markdown already, please visit this website. </p>

<p>Of course, markdown is totally optional. If you don&#39;t want to include it feel free to leave it out of the INSTALL_APPS list. Just make sure you make corresponding changes to your templates or else you&#39;ll get exceptions. </p>

<p>JavaScript LibrariesThe JavaScript used by django-blogs relies on the jQuery library. You can download it from their website. The latest tested version is jQuery 1.2.6 -- newer version should work as well. </p>

<p>The dashboard interface uses tiny_mce for the advanced HTML editor. You can grab it from their website: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php. The latest version that has been tested to work is 3.0.4.1, but newer versions will most likely work as well. If something breaks please let me know! </p>

<p>Getting StartedThese are the steps to start using django-blogs in your project. </p>

<p>Grab The AppCurrently you can only obtain a copy of the code by checking out the trunk from SVN. I&#39;ll provide easier installation methods as this project matures. </p>

 title : The django-cart Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: django-cart is a different project starting on March 25th, 2009. Thanks a lot to Eric Woudenberg for letting us reuse this project </p>

<p>django-cart is a very simple application that just let you add and remove items from a session based cart. django-cart doesn&#39;t provide any product information, and you&#39;ve to define your own product models, and then use their instances on the cart. </p>

<p>A basic usage of django-cart could be: </p>

<p>views.py </p>

<p>from cart import Cart
<br/>from myproducts.models import Product</p>

<p>def add_to_cart(request, product_id, quantity):
<br/>    product = Product.objects.get(id=product_id)
<br/>    cart = Cart(request)
<br/>    cart.add(product, product.unit_price, quantity)</p>

<p>def remove_from_cart(request, product_id):
<br/>    product = Product.objects.get(id=product_id)
<br/>    cart = Cart(request)
<br/>    cart.remove(product)</p>

<p>def get_cart(request):
<br/>    return render_to_response(&#39;cart.html&#39;, dict(cart=Cart(request)))templates/cart.html </p>

<p>{% extends &#39;base.html&#39; %}</p>

<p>{% block body %}
<br/>    
<br/>        
<br/>            Product
<br/>            Quantity
<br/>            Total Price
<br/>        
<br/>        {% for item in cart %}
<br/>        
<br/>            {{ item.product.name }}
<br/>            {{ item.quantity }}
<br/>            {{ item.total_price }}

 summary : <p>Cheetah template engine for DjangoUsage Use the render_cheetah_response shortcut just as you would use render_to_response  Use the CheetahTemplate class to render contexts in your views from text or file News - Now released a version which is the stand alone module django_cheetahtemplates and contains the application of the example below. See the source svn repository for the most up to date code. </p>

<p>ExamplePut this in your views  </p>

<p>from django_cheetahtemplates import render_cheetah_response,CheetahTemplate
<br/>from django.template import Context
<br/>from django.http import HttpResponse</p>

<p>def hello(request):
<br/>    # Use shortcut
<br/>    return render_cheetah_response(&#39;hello.tmpl&#39;, {&#39;myvar&#39;:&#39;hello world&#39;,&#39;range&#39;:range} )</p>

<p>def hello2(request):
<br/>    # Create and render context
<br/>    context = Context({&#39;myvar&#39;:&#39;hello&#39;})
<br/>    context[&#39;range&#39;] = range
<br/>    template = CheetahTemplate(filename=&#39;hello.tmpl&#39;)
<br/>    return HttpResponse(template.render(context))Then create hello.tmpl somewhere in your TEMPLATE_DIRS </p>

<p>$myvar
<br/>#for i in $range(10)
<br/>$i#slurp
<br/>#end forWhen you go to the url linked to either hello or hello2 you will see this </p>

<p>hello world 0123456789Capabilities: </p>

<p>Django context/template rendering compatibility with CheetahTemplate class.  Shortcut replacement for render_to_response =&gt; render_cheetah_response </p>

<p>TODO: </p>

<p>Cheetah template path search (always defaults to your project directory when trying to include files) Fix: find your template from there with relative links?

 title : The django-chunks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is now hosted at Github!, </p>
 title : The django-clevercss Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Today I stumbled upon the CleverCSS project and decided I liked it and wanted to experiment with it.  In an effort to find a use for it, I decided to create this project that allows you to use CleverCSS in your Django templates. </p>

<p>What Does django-clevercss Do?This project allows you to create CleverCSS stylesheets using the classic Django administration utility.  The use of a template tag, get_clever_css, will allow you to use these stylesheets that are stored in your database.  The template tag retrieve the stylesheet by its title and spits out a file on the filesystem each time the stylesheet changes in the database.  This slightly reduces the amount of overhead because the CleverCSS stylesheet does not need to be parsed for each page request. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-clevercss using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>Checkout from Subversionsvn co http://django-clevercss.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-clevercssPackage DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still working on a setup.py script to make this easier, so for the time being you need to put the dlevercss (clevercss with a d) application somewhere on your PYTHONPATH.  Usually, a safe bet is something like /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages or C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages. </p>

<p>RequirementsThis application requires CleverCSS to be installed on your system.  An easy way to install this utility is to use easy_install: </p>

<p>sudo easy_install clevercssor </p>

<p>easy_install clevercssFor more information and syntax help for CleverCSS, see the project homepage. </p>

<p>Important note: I built this project on Django 1.0 alpha (rev. 8222), which uses the newforms-admin.  This means that the project is currently incompatible with any revision of Django (at least the administration utility) before July 18th, 2008.  If there is enough demand, I suppose I can insert a simple class Admin into the model to solve the problem.  However, since I am eagerly looking forward to the official release of Django 1.0 in the near future, I will leave the code as is (again, unless there is a demand for &quot;backward compatibility&quot;). </p>

<p>UsageFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;dlevercss&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb. </p>

<p>Create a new stylesheet in the Django administration utility (see the CleverCSS homepage for syntax guidance), and save it. </p>

<p>Then in your Django template, simply do something like this: </p>

<p>{% load dlevercss_tags %}</p>

<p>Django-CleverCSS</p>

<p>Header 1
<br/>Bla bla bla</p>

<p>Note the {% load dlevercss_tags %} at the top of the snippet.  Assuming your settings.MEDIA_URL is /media/ and the stylesheet you created in the administration utility was named Testing, you should end up with something like /media/clevercss/testing.css in the link tag&#39;s href attribute. </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the project checks to see if the stylesheet in the database is newer than the stylesheet on the filesystem.  If it is, the CleverCSS stylesheet in the database will be parsed by clevercss and crammed into a real CSS file that your templates can access and use. </p>

<p>As of revision 4, the project includes a tag for inline CleverCSS: </p>

<p>{% load dlevercss_tags %}</p>

<p>Django-CleverCSS</p>

<p>{% clevercss %}
<br/>body:
<br/>    background-color: #333</p>

<p>    h1:
<br/>        color: #f00
<br/>        weight: normal
<br/>{% endclevercss %}</p>

<p>Header 1
<br/>Bla bla bla</p>

<p>Be sure to watch your indentation with this tag :) </p>

<p>Good luck!  Please contact me with any questions or concerns you have with the project!</p>

 summary : <p>Together with django-forumBR, django-comics is part of the Pigmalion Project.It&#39;s identification is Green-Pigmalion.  </p>

<p>Pigmalion ProjectsBlue Pigmalion As all Pigmalion projects, it uses MooTools as javascript framework and BluePrintCSS as css framework. </p>

<p>Current Version0.45 0.6 </p>

<p>Used FrameworksCSS Framework : blueprintcss (helps big time! I&#39;m no designer, folks ;) Javascript Framework : MooTools (prettier then jquery) </p>

<p>Version 1.0 goals ... </p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s say you need to create a page to an artist, like a virtual comic book. This app does just that! It makes it easy to create a colection of related comic books. Basically, my inspiration came from the lot of great online comic books out there.From marvelous Grim Tales(and company!) comics, fantastic Flaky Pastry, caustic Sexy Loosers, up to the clever XKCD comics. I hope this is usefull to someone and if suggestions are ALWAYS welcomed! </p>

<p>Right now, django-comics is in version 0.3, as it needs improved visual editing, needs beter coding, and solid access restrictions. Therefore, one can still use it for simples projects without problem.  </p>

<p>Django-comics is now in version 0.45. That means it kind of works, but is still kind of ugly. Let&#39;s see the features so far: Django-comics is now in version 0.6. That means it works fine, but there are a few funcionality missing yeat. Let&#39;s see the features so far: </p>

<p>You can have as many comic books within the app as you want(even one!) You can set access policies as &#39;who can comment&#39; Mature content filter(naughty things get asks for age) You can define the header image easely Comics accept commeting(i&#39;ll probaly change that to use django commenting contrib..) A viewer can browse through all the comic book strips in archive random strip view implemented you can add comic strips right from comics. No admin here Missing </p>

<p>Inline comic message sensoring Logging Finish CleverCSS template Maybe make it look prettier. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much it! Check django-comics in action within this url : http://www.italomaia.com/comics/</p>
 title : The django-compress Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-compress provides an automated system for compressing CSS and JavaScript files. By default, it only outputs compressed files, while not in DEBUG-mode. That means you can still debug and edit your source files while coding, and when going to production, the compressed files will be automatically generated. </p>

<p>Support for jsmin and CSSTidy is included and enabled by default (but can easily be disabled). </p>

<p>django-compress includes template tags for outputting the URLs to the CSS/JavaScript-files and some other goodies to improve the performance of serving static media. </p>

<p>See the following wiki-pages for more information: </p>

<p>Introduction Features Installation Configuration Usage FarFutureExpires Customization </p>

<p>django-compress was written by Andreas Pelme . Feel free to contact me with questions, suggestions etc. </p>

<p>The Python-version of jsmin (http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html) is included in django-compress. It was translated from to Python by Baruch Evan, from the original jsmin implementation by Douglas Crockford.</p>
 summary : <p>This is the first approach to give admins a nice interface for geographical data. With the included CoordinatesFormField it is possible to add and edit GPS coordinates using one of the popular map services from Google and Yahoo. </p>

<p>Since most of the work is done via Javascript it has a nice fallback with a default TextField. The javascript code is written with generalisation in mind to handle the differences between the map systems. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>from django.db import models
<br/>from field import CoordinatesField</p>

<p>class Location (models.Model):
<br/>    name = models.CharField(maxlength=100)
<br/>    gps = CoordinatesField()Please watch the Subversion repository for changes</p>

 summary : <p>Django CountriesNice little application for Django projects providing fixtures and models for a &quot;complete&quot; list of world countries and US states. Also throwing in a small template filter for getting country flags by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. </p>

<p>InstallationJust check out the latest source and copy countries into your django site directory: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://django-countries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-countriesadd countries to the list of installed apps and run syncdb and you&#39;re good to go. (Note: the models are fixed to the country and usstate tables, se models.py for details) </p>

<p>And for the flags hed over to famfamfam and download the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code flag package. And add a flags director to your media root and copy the .gif flags there.  An alternative flag resource is ip2location </p>

<p>Optionally add: </p>

<p>COUNTRIES_FLAG_PATH = &#39;flags/%s.png&#39;to django settings if you want to have the flags in an alternative location or use .png instead of the default .gif ( .gif is just a tiny bit smaller ;) </p>

<p>Source of informationCountry listThe list of world countries is based on the list of ISO 3166 codes for countries in existence at the time of last update. The tricky part is getting the list complete with iso-2 code, iso-3 code, number and official printable name se models.py for more details. Therefore this country list is a merge from these two resources: </p>

<p>http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm The official list is constantly receiving updates, so the list might not be 100% accurate. </p>

<p>Country list last updated: 2007-08-20 - 244 countries. </p>

<p>US States listDEPRECATED django.contrib.localflavor provides listings of states. This is still not implemented in the app and needs some modifications to work. US states list is a plain list of name and abbreviation. Making the list more complete are the additional six military &quot;states&quot; all according to the usps list at the time of last update: </p>

<p>To create a Cron Job you create a file called cron.py in your application directory that will contain the jobs you wish to run. Once you have your jobs created you need add two lines to your primary urls.py (Similar to what you need to do for the admin site) </p>

<p>import django_cron
<br/>django_cron.autodiscover()That will go though all your installed apps and see if they have a cron job to register </p>

<p>Example Cron Job included in the applicationfrom django_cron import cronScheduler, Job</p>

<p># This is a function I wrote to check a feedback email address and add it to our database. Replace with your own imports

 summary : <p>Django Dynamic Media ServeDjango Dynamic Media Serve is the good alternative of the default django.views.static.serve for serving the media files in Django. You can simply set just one line in urls.py. </p>

<p>At first, Django Dynamic Media Serve was developed for web album application, which handles enoumous image thumbnails and huge javascript files and each time when new files is added, creating thumbnail and compressing javascript files is so painful, so we wrote this Django Dynamic Media Serve to dynamically handle various media files in runtime without using any already-created file, especially image files. </p>

<p>FeatureVarious Media Serve thru DjangoSVG images(png, gif, jpeg, etc which can be supported by PIL). javascript any other files. External MediaIf you need to fetch the media from outside of your media repository, Django Dynamic Media Serve support the ourside media. It can be useful for Cross-Domain access in Ajax script. </p>

<p>Image Resizing and CropingUsing PIL(Imaging Python module), Django Dynamic Media Serve can create normal image thumbnail by image size ratio and can create the flicker style thumbnail. </p>

<p>~Javascript Compression~~Django Dynamic Media Serve can compress the javascript file using jsmin,.~ Django Media Server no longer does support javascript compression using jsmin because of the confirmed comment, &#39;/, /&#39; related problems. </p>

<p>Support If-Modified-Since, If-None-MatchTo respect the If-Modified-Since and Etag, Django Dynamic Media Serve can handle properly the If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match header variables. </p>

<p>CachingSupport the native Django caching system</p>

 title : The django-emailthis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-emailthis is a simple email-to-a-friend application that generates an email form, handles its submission, persists the submission data to a database, and sends a templated email.  Both anonymous and registered users can send email. </p>

<p>This app started out as a quasi-fork of Jeff Croft&#39;s &quot;mailfriend&quot; app (http://code.google.com/p/django-mailfriend/), but the latter only supported registered users; this supports users of both the registered and unregistered varieties. </p>

<p>Form submission is here done solely via ajax; loading is intended to be handled similarly.</p>

 title : The django-evserver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django_evserver is simple http server for Django applications. It&#39;s based on libevent library. The main advantage of django_evserver is that it provides methods of preempting django views. You can render a site in several chunks, each of them can be handled by different django view. </p>

<p>Using this idea it&#39;s possible to use django_evserver as comet server for django applications. </p>

<p>Yes! Now you can write comet applications in django!</p>

<p>Currently only implements server side generation and validation of fields. </p>

<p>The extdjango/ directory in svn, is the proof-of-concept ext example i build to demonstrate server side generated and validated forms. Work on the real connector will start soon. </p>

<p>In the mean time if you want to checkout the extdjango example, change at least the following: </p>

<p>U have to move extdjango/extdjango.js to somewhere in your directory root Change the templates extdjango/ to match your ExtJS and extdjango.js links Change the hardcoded urls in extdjango.js, if u change the urls.</p>
 title : The django-farstyle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Farstyle simplifies the management and serving of CSS and JavaScript asset files. Required css or js files, conveniently defined and ordered in the database, are merged and compressed, then inserted into your HTML using a single templatetag. Unique file name used for merged asset files enable far-future caching, with a change in any file causing a new merged asset file to be generated and loaded by browsers. </p>

<p>The merging and optimization process is fully customizable, offering control over both the overall processing of merged assets, as well as the handling of each individual file. CSS and JavaScript files can be individualy exempted from merging or optimization, and custom conditions can be used to group and serve files as separate assets based on request parameters or optional templatetag variables. </p>

<p>Farstyle also helps with the creation of CSS and JavaScript files, by allowing them to be rendered from Django templates. Farstyle searches for files in both template provider locations and static filesystem directories, creating the opportunity to override static files with same-name templates. </p>

<p>For development, merging and optimization are disabled when DEBUG is set to True. In this case individual tags are created for each file, with an added query string parameter which ensures that changed files will always be reloaded by browsers. </p>

<p>A bonus feature enables far future caching of media files, such as large images that rarely change. </p>

<p>Main FeaturesDefine CSS and JavaScript files in the database. Control the files&#39; order, toggle merging/compression for each file, and write custom Python rules to determine when files are to be used. Create CSS and JavaScript files using django templates. Use constants in your template-based CSS, defined in an optional settings module. Override static CSS and JS files with template-based versions (especially useful when combined with django-dbtemplates). Write CSS in less or sass format. Include all defined CSS and JS files in your templates using a single templatetag (single tag for each asset type, with the provision for using multiple tags combined with conditional statements). Create far-future-caching friendly image tags for large images that rarely change. CSS and JS files are merged down to the smallest possible number of asset files to optimize loading, and are named using unique names which allow browsers to cache assets while immediately loading new versions when assets are changed. Merged and optimized asset files are re-generated on demand when any of the original CSS or JS files are modified. The Sites application is supported, using Many-to-Many relationships so that multiple sites can share common assets. CreditsFarstyle&#39;s database-based specification of CSS and JavaScript files was inspired by django-assetpackager. </p>

<p>The use of customizable filter chains to control optimization and compression of assets was inspired by django-compress, and much of the filtering code was taken from that project. </p>

<p>The Python version of jsmin insluded in Farstyle was translated to Python by Baruch Evan, from the original jsmin implementation by Douglas Crockford.</p>

 title : The django-fckconnector Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FCKeditor is a Javascript-based rich text editor for web applications. One of the enhanced features it offers is a web-based browser for media files stored on the server. The browser relies on a server-side connector to provide XML responses for commands. FCKeditor includes connectors for many server-side technologies, including a Python CGI implementation. However, when using FCKeditor in a Django application, it is desirable to implement the connector within the Django process. This project provides a Django-based implementation of the FCKeditor server side specification.</p>

 title : The django-gcal Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Django application allowing developers to synchronise instances of their models with Google Calendar. Using Django&#39;s signals mechanism and generic relations, no changes to the model being synchronised are required, and synchronisation occurs without user intervention over the models lifecycle. </p>

<p>InstallationCheckout the contents of http://django-gcal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ to somewhere on your PYTHONPATH. </p>

<p>UsageIn a typical scenario, the following steps are required to use django-gcal: </p>

<p>Add djangogcal to the list of installed applications in your settings.py. Define a djangogcal.adapter.CalendarAdapter for each model you want synchronised. Instantiate a djangogcal.observer.CalendarObserver for each Google Calendar feed. Call the CalendarObserver.observe(model, adapter) method to link models with the Google Calendar feed. See GettingStarted for more information, and RelatedModels for information about sending updates when related objects are changed. </p>

<p>ExampleThe code in this example is sufficient to bind a model to Google Calendar. </p>

<p>from django.conf import settings</p>

<p>from djangogcal.adapter import CalendarAdapter, CalendarEventData
<br/>from djangogcal.observer import CalendarObserver</p>

<p>from models import Showing</p>

<p>class ShowingCalendarAdapter(CalendarAdapter):
<br/>    &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>    A calendar adapter for the Showing model.
<br/>    &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>    
<br/>    def get_event_data(self, instance):
<br/>        &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>        Returns a CalendarEventData object filled with data from the adaptee.
<br/>        &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>        return CalendarEventData(
<br/>            start=instance.start_time,
<br/>            end=instance.end_time,
<br/>            title=instance.title
<br/>        )</p>

<p>observer = CalendarObserver(email=settings.CALENDAR_EMAIL,
<br/>                            password=settings.CALENDAR_PASSWORD)
<br/>observer.observe(Showing, ShowingCalendarAdapter())</p>
 summary : <p>This project aims to be a drop-in solution for calendaring for any django app. I use this code, so it is living and breathing. If you have questions or suggestions for edge cases, I&#39;ll entertain them, but I can&#39;t guarantee that I&#39;ll implement them.

<p>I also have a version of this code that doesn&#39;t require jQuery and simply piggy backs off the javascript that comes with a standard Django installation, but the code is a bit dusty.  I&#39;ve added it into branches and will be updating it when I&#39;ve got time.</p>

 summary : <p>Overviewdjango-geo-kit is built on top to GeoDjango, the GIS branch of the Django Framework.  GeoDjango wraps three powerful libraries into one intuitive package: PostGIS, GEOS, and Proj.4. DGT complements this functionality with tools that work with you at the application level.  With DGT, you can easily relate GIS information to your models and the API is designed to return data in formats that work well with both maps and user interface controls. 
<br/> </p>

<p>GoalsThe goal of django-geo-tools (DGT) is to provide a well-rounded and easy to use suite of tools for adding basic geospatial features to your Django apps.  The project will include utilities for adding location attributes to your models as well as client side tools for mapping the data. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>DGT will help you spruce up your web applications with features like: </p>

<p>GeoTagging Find within city, state, zip code  Proximity searches based on a street address or (latitude,longitude) point Interactive maps - let users label locations on a map </p>

<p> NOTE this project is in very early stages of development     For the early phases of development, the client side mapping capabilities will be based on the Google Maps API.</p>
 title : The django-geo-kit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I manage a lot of Django projects that present slightly-different forms to users depending on the site/domain they&#39;re visiting.  There&#39;s also a bunch of custom submission code that differs from form to form, but that&#39;s neither here nor there. </p>

<p>I need different Google Analytics codes depending on the sites and after sticking these tags into every single template, I thought it would be cool to be able to manage these Google analytics accounts from the Django admin page. I also added a mode of operation that excludes the admin interface altogether (you can just use the template tag) </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t there other solutions already?In my searches I ran across two methods that have been around for a while but which I didn&#39;t find to be adequate.  The first is a Google Analytics middleware by Will Larson.  This method inspects each request, searches it for a  tag and dynamically insert the google analytics code.   </p>

<p>The bad thing is that the template for the tags are hard coded into the middleware, and as far as I know, this kind of defeats the purpose of caching, as a regular expression and some other code must be called for every request.  You&#39;ve also got to purposefully exclude the admin interface, which most people are never going to want to track anyway.   </p>

<p>Finally, you can&#39;t tie GA codes to sites (you can specify them in different settings files, though) and have them inserted properly.  I like the ability to administer as much as possible from the admin (when ideal). </p>

<p>The second method I found was a snippet that defined a simple template tag which replicates the second mode of operation you see below.  It&#39;s a little raw, but it works.  The main downside with this is that, again, you cannot edit the codes from the admin interface and you can&#39;t tie them to specific sites. </p>

<p>Two modes of operationAdministering and associating codes with Django sites Add the google_analytics application to your INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py.  This mode requires that you be using the Django sites framework too, so make sure you have that set up as well.  Add GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MODEL = True to your settings.py  Run a ./manage.py syncdb to add the database tables  Go to your project&#39;s admin page (usually /admin/) and click into a site objects  You&#39;ll now see a new field under the normal site information called &quot;Analytics Code&quot;. In this box you put your unique analytics code for your project&#39;s domain.  It looks like UA-xxxxxx-x and save the site.  In your base template (usually a base.html) insert this tag at the very top: {% load analytics %}  In the same template, insert the following code right before the closing body tag: {% analytics %} Just using the template tag Add the google_analytics application to your INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py.  In your base template, usually a base.html, insert this tag at the very top: {% load analytics %}  In the same template, insert the following code right before the closing body tag: {% analytics &quot;UA-xxxxxx-x&quot; %} the UA-xxxxxx-x is a unique Google Analytics code for you domain when you sign up for a new account.</p>

 title : The django-googleanalytics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Simple solution for a simple task. This app helps you including google analyitics tracking codes to your site templates. </p>

<p>DocumentationInstallationCheckout the app from the svn repo:  svn co http://django-googleanalytics.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google_analyticsMake sure the app is in your python path and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS settings Add the templatetag {% googleanalytics %} where you want the google analitics code to be inserted in your templates, don&#39;t forget to load it first in each template: {% load googleanalytics_tags %}. You can use as many tags as you need and you can (optionally) specify diferent codes for each, see bellow if you want some examples: Using the googleanalytics tagSyntax: </p>

<p>{% googleanalytics [account-code] %}The simplest and tipical usage of this tag: </p>

<p>{% googleanalytics %}This just inserts in place the google analitics tracking code (this is just a cuple of html script tags) using the account code (the code that idenifies your account) specified in the GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_CODE setting. If you don&#39;t set this or set it to False the tag will be ignored and no code will be inserted (this is useful in some cases... for example I prefer to set it to False in my development local settings insted of using {% if not debug %}). </p>

<p>You can also explicitly pass the account code as a tag param: </p>

<p>{% googleanalytics &quot;UA-xxxxxx-x&quot; %}This is specially usefull if you want to track to different accounts depending on the view/template, you can use this tag as many times as you need. </p>

<p>About the tracking code templateThe tracking code is the html code that google ask you to put on the pages to be tracked, in this app the code lives in a template (google_analitics/tracking_code.html) so you can override it if you want. </p>

<p>Using the legacy tracking code (urchin.js)If you use the default template you can use the legacy tracking code. </p>

<p>By default the current recomended tracking code by google is used (ga.js) but if you have good reasons you can use the legacy tracking code (the old urchin.js) by setting GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_LEGACY_CODE = True, in your settings, but keep in mind that this is not recomended by google: &quot;Please note that urchin.js will not receive feature updates and is not compatible with new features.&quot;.</p>

 summary : <p>Django Granular Permissions allow you to setup per-row permissions. </p>

<p>ver 0.2 adds NewForms-Admin support. </p>

<p>This project is injecting new methods into Django&#39;s auth.User and auth.Group in a non-invasive way (doesn&#39;t require modifying Django&#39;s code). </p>

<p>Simple permission checks within views and templates with templatetags. </p>

<p>You just simply have to install django-granular-permissions somewhere on your PYTHONPATH and add &#39;django_granular_permissions&#39; to your installed apps and invoke </p>

<p>python manage.py syncdbNote: superusers will always have True returned on has_row_perm(), also not active users will always get False </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p># adding permission &#39;edit&#39; to a user &#39;Bart&#39; on an instance of a MyObject from myapp.models
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from myapp.models import MyObject
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user = User.objects.get(username=&#39;Bart&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = MyObject()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj.save()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.add_row_perm(obj, &#39;edit&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.has_row_perm(obj, &#39;edit&#39;)
<br/>True
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.has_row_perm(obj, &#39;delete&#39;)
<br/>False </p>

<p># similar for groups
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; group = Group.objects.get(pk=1) # get first group in the db
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_row_perm(obj, &#39;read&#39;)</p>

<p># now we&#39;ll add the user to the group and he will inherit the &#39;read&#39; permission
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.groups.add(group)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.has_row_perm(obj, &#39;read&#39;)
<br/>True</p>

<p># now to remove permission
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.del_row_perm(obj, &#39;edit&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.has_row_perm(obj, &#39;edit&#39;)
<br/>False</p>

<p># note that when you try to remove a permission from a user that is granted to him through group nothing changes
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.del_row_perm(obj, &#39;read&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.has_row_perm(obj, &#39;read&#39;)
<br/>True</p>

<p># get all rows for a MyObject table that given user has &#39;read&#39; permission
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; user.get_rows_with_permission(MyObject(), &#39;read&#39;)
<br/># same method exists for groups</p>

<p>The project is currently feature incomplete and is not yet suitable for production use. Oh, and it&#39;s buggy and will probably eat your prized possessions. </p>

<p>However, if you insist on living on the edge, the current code is being developed against the latest stable release of Django (currently 1.0.2). The included example_project provides a set of very basic templates to at least get you started. Please note though that this example_project depends on a recent checkout of James Bennett&#39;s django-registration. To get started with the django-issues code: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://django-issues.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-issuesThen simply: </p>

<p>cd django-issues/example_project
<br/>./manage.py syncdb
<br/>./manage.py runserverPlease note once again that this is nowhere near feature complete. There are no &#39;stable&#39; release available.</p>

<p>snippets   macros  commands  toolbars  templates extensions  Since a user of Komodo Edit will have individual preferences for which aspects of the application they are most comfortable with, features will be available via as many editor-specific hooks as makes sense.  For example, a feature to create stub code for a new Model could appear as a toolbar button, a context menu item in various places, or a snippet. </p>

 summary : <p>Documentación en español de django-menuse. </p>

<p>menuseThis app lets you create and administer menus from flatpages in 5 easy steps: </p>

<p>Create your flatpages. Create a menu. Generate links based on a flatpage or URI. Select the links corresponding to that menu. Place the menu in your HTML. </p>

<p>FeaturesNo need to create new flatpages or modify it&#39;s code. Can link to existing flatpages. Can link to a flatpage or URI. Menus and/or links can be restricted to staff users only. Menus and/or links can be restricted to (not) authenticated users. Possibility of having multiple menus. Menus can share links. Include your menu with just one simple template tag. Support for keywords. A separator between links can be defined from the template. (Only in svn) URL names can be used instead of the full URL. (Only in svn) KeywordsKeywords are a way to set links dynamically. </p>

<p>{{ SELF }} It&#39;s replaced with the URI that is being visited. {{ GET }} It&#39;s replaced with all the parameters received by the GET method. {{ URL }} It&#39;s replaced with the URI of the site. {{ LOGIN }} It&#39;s replaced with settings.LOGIN_URL {{ LOGOUT }} It&#39;s replaced with settings.LOGOUT_URL {{ SIGNUP }} It&#39;s replaced with settings.SIGNUP_URL (Only in svn) Be careful with the last one, remember that SIGNUP_URL is not a standard setting, so it will raise an exception if it&#39;s not found, but the templatetag will fail silently. This means that if all your links point to the URL you are viewing and rebooting your web server doesn&#39;t fix it, check this. </p>

<p>The keyword SELF is useful when combined with, for example, LOGIN: </p>

<p>{{ LOGIN }}?next={{ SELF }}Would result in something like: </p>

<p>/accounts/login/?next=/product/view/007/ReverseWhen the keyword &#39;reverse:&#39; appears in a URL, menuse will know that it has to resolve the given name to a URL. Suppose you have the following: </p>

<p>urls.py </p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    (r&#39;accounts/^$&#39;, index, name=&#39;user-home&#39;),
<br/>    (r&#39;accounts/profile/^$&#39;, profile, name=&#39;user-profile&#39;),
<br/>    (r&#39;accounts/url/^$&#39;, url, name=&#39;user-url&#39;))This would be the link&#39;s URL: </p>

<p>reverse:user-profile?next=reverse:user-home&amp;url=reverse:user-urlWhich would output: </p>

<p>/accounts/profile/?next=/accounts/&amp;url=/accounts/url/This could also be combined with keywords! Like this: </p>

<p>{{ SIGNUP }}?next=reverse:user-homeLimitationsReversing names has still some limitations: </p>

<p>Can&#39;t reverse two consecutive URLs, needs at least one ? or &amp; character in between them. I see no real problem in this, but if you need a different behavior let me know. Check utils.py for more information. Passing arguments to the URL is not implemented yet. </p>

<p>TODOsAllow subitems. Allow multiple coma separated urls. Allow linking by url name. SourceCheckout a copy from the SVN: svn checkout http://django-menuse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ menuseDownload the source compressed. This could be a little out of date with respect to the svn. And a little buggy too. InstallationGet the source and copy the files to a directory in your project (i.e. &quot;menuse&quot;.) Add the app to your INSTALLED_APPS. Run syncdb. UsageCreate the flatpages you will link to (if you don&#39;t have them already.) Create links that will be included in your menus and link them to a flatpage, URI or keyword. Create the menus you need and select which links to display. In your template: Load the template tag: {% load render_menu %} Place the menu in the HTML: {% render_menu MenuName %} Every menu is displayed as an unordered list (</p>

<p>) and every link as a list item () Both have a class attribute, the menu&#39;s class is it&#39;s name in lowercase and the link&#39;s class is the same as the menu&#39;s plus &quot;_item&quot;. </p>

 title : The django-modelhistory Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Revision Support for Django ModelsMotivationThe &#39;fullhistory&#39; branch has been lying dormant for a few months it seems (at least no commits to the django hosted branch) - so I&#39;ve recently updated and implemented leftover functionality in a modified version of the branch. </p>

<p>DisclaimersThis code has been tested and should work with django trunk (last tested r5546) and is likely to have some backwards-incompatibility (I haven&#39;t tested it) with 0.96 or earlier, though feedback on this issue is welcome. This code will be experiencing some potentially significant functional changes as some leftover features are integrated - this is your fair warning :-D It is undoubtedly imperfect, but it should work in common use cases that are checked by the included tests. The embedded docs should shed light on any differences. The current code also provides for determining the calling user (the django.contrib.auth.models.User who initiated the model change). This method works (tilts head) but is meant more as a placeholder until a better implementation is discussed/implemented. API</p>

<p>Method Name                                Return Value       get_version(obj,rev)                       Model/None       get_version_by_date(obj,date)              QuerySet/list()     get_history(obj,offset=0)                  QuerySet/list()     set_version(obj,rev)                       Model/None       restore_version(content_type,obj_id,rev)    Model/None     </p>

<p>Future WorkModelhistory should probably provide some means (if end user-desired) of providing distinct tables for each revisioned object. With regard to (1), we have syncdb hooks and  could be autogenerated; however, (1) might be best served when coupled with a distinct subsystem that manages backend-specific logic - i.e., django/ multi-db allowing for a separate archival database, in which case this discussion would require a much broader consensus/design points. Consider implementing delta-only change log entries (full object serialized in first version, deltas only to follow - (space v. execution time (specifically,reverts))</p>

Django&#39;s caching framework supports any backend you&#39;d like to use easily, but I&#39;ll be most likely testing with memcached and simple. </p>

<p>TimelineDevelopment started on May the 28th; the timeline is covered in the djangoproject.com wiki page currently, but will likely undergo some changes yet.</p>

 title : The django-offline Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>With the recent release of Google Gears, there is a real possibility of making Django applications available offline. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to port certain portions of Django to JavaScript, for use with Google Gears. In the end, a Django application will be available to automate part of this process, as well as a framework for tying in custom JavaScript code to fill in the gaps that can&#39;t be automated.</p>
 title : The django-on-twisted Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is DOT(Django On Twisted)Normally, django runs on Apache web server as production server or runserver feature in django for development, but under Apache, it takes too much time to (re)start and is difficult to combine other python-based network applications, like pydirector for load-balancing, so I use this script for running django on Twisted.web2 framework. </p>

<p>The DOT is the derived work of jnoetzelman&#39;s work in Django development trac. </p>

<p>RequirementPython 2.5(or later) twisted framework 2.5(or later or svn) twisted.web2 0.2.0(or later or svn) InstallationDownload the DOT(Django On Twisted) and uncompress the tarball. </p>

<p>ConfigurationIn the DOT&#39;s default configuration file, conf.py, you can edit the default configuration. This is default conf.py. </p>

<p># ports to be run.
<br/>PORTS = (9000, )</p>

<p># private key path
<br/>SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = None</p>

<p># logging style, &#39;apache&#39; or None
<br/>LOG_STYLE = NonePORTSThe DOT supports the multiple instance of your django project, that is you can run the sam e project in the many instance, which runs with another port. PORTS is the tuple datatype of python, so you append the other ports inside tuple like this, </p>

<p>PORTS = (9000, 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, )SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATHThe DOT supports SSL, it rely on the Twisted SSL feature(twisted.internet.ssl). If you set the pem file path in the SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, if SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH is set, DOT automatically runs your django project in SSL. </p>

<p>LOG_STYLEThe Twisted.web2 print out the apache-style log, but for the purpose of debuggin, DOT support the managed-style log. If you set the apache in LOG_STYLE, you can have the apache-style log. </p>

<p>All the log will be stored in log/ directory and log name is .log. </p>

<p>Run Your Django ProjectAfter the configuration, you are ready to run the DOT, just simply type like this, </p>

<p>spike@bebop:/bebop/work/django_test$ sh init.sh django_test startAs I alreay mentioned, the django_test is your django project name. init.sh support 4 actions like the init script of UNIX. </p>

<p>Actions of init.sh </p>

<p>start  start your django project  stop  stop it  restart  restart it  stand  don&#39;t fork it as sub-process, so all the log can monitor in there  </p>

 title : The django-pennypress Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Penny Press newspaper was a cheap paper in the 19th century that brought the news to the masses because it was affordable for the working class. </p>

<p>Penny Press is an open source content management system geared towards local online news sites.   </p>

<p>Building an online news site is expensive.  Penny Press hopes to lower the cost needed to enter the online news world.  As the big newspapers companies lose more and more money, local news will be produced by fewer and fewer companies and in turn, there will be fewer voices in the press.  The lower cost of entrance will help keep the diversity of those voices in tact. </p>

<p>Penny Press will follow standards found both in the web world and the news world. Standards such as NITF/NewsML import and export from the news world.  Standards such as RSS/Atom from the web world. </p>

<p>Penny Press has been migrated to launchpad.net, http://launchpad.net/django-pennypress</p>

 title : The django-photoblog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is in early alpha. </p>

<p>Please come back in some weeks, </p>
 title : The django-photologue Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Photologue is a reusable Django application that provides powerful image management and manipulation functionality as well as a complete photo gallery solution. The 2.0 release adds more effects, including reflections and transparent watermarks. It also introduces the ImageModel abstract base class allowing developers to easily integrated the Photologue core functionality into their own models. Photologue embraces the Django admin and smoothly integrates with photo thumbnails and effect previews.</p>
 summary : <p>I wanted an easy way to get any random image from my Picasa Web public gallery onto my Web page, so I built this.  It uses the RSS feeds provided by Google to first find all of the public albums.  Then it finds all photos within the albums it finds.  Basic information about each photo and album is then stored in the local database to make retrieval a bit faster.  The local database can easily be refreshed when needed from the Django administration utility. </p>

<p>InstallationI don&#39;t have a packaged release for django-picasa yet, so you&#39;ll have to stick with an SVN version. </p>

<p>svn co http://django-picasa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/picasaPut the contents of that directory somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, and you should be good to go.  To verify your installation, try the following command: </p>

<p>python -c &quot;import picasa&quot;If that doesn&#39;t display any errors (or output at all), then your installation worked.  If it spits out an ImportError, something went wrong. </p>

<p>Next, in your settings.py file, just add &#39;picasa&#39; to your INSTALLED_APPS list, specify the gallery (or galleries) to use by specifying something like PICASA_USERS = [&#39;mypicasausername&#39;] in settings.py, and run ./manage.py syncdb to install the required tables.  As soon as that is done, log into your site&#39;s administration panel and enter either the Picasa Albums or Picasa Photos section and click the &quot;Refresh database&quot; button/link.  If this link is not available (you might need to install JQuery in a special place...), try going to /admin/picasa/update/. </p>

<p>UsageIn the template that you would like the random image to be displayed in, make sure you have {% load picasa_tags %} somewhere (most likely near the top of your template).  Then you may use the {% random_picasa_photo %} template tag to insert your image. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for some &quot;fancy&quot; effects, you can use the random_picasa_photo.js file that comes with django-picasa.  You may find it at picasa/templates/picasa/random_picasa_photo.js.  In it, I employ JQuery to change the random image every so often, fading images in and out in the process.  All of the images are displayed using CSS.</p>

 summary : <p>DescriptionA Django external database backend for MS SQL Server that uses ODBC by employing the pyodbc library, supports SQL Server 2000 and 2005.  </p>

<p>Pyodbc seems to be a mature, viable way to access SQL Server from Python in multiple platforms and is actively maintained. It&#39;s also used by SQLAlchemy for SQL Server connections. </p>

<p>ImportantIf you are following Django trunk development and have revision 10026 or newer, the minimal development revision of django-pyodbc trunk you need to use is r157. </p>

<p>Also, the DATABASE_ODBC_DRIVER, DATABASE_ODBC_DSN and DATABASE_ODBC_EXTRA_PARAMS settings were migrated to the DATABASE_OPTIONS dictionary setting in this revision. </p>

<p>This is a backward-incompatible change for setups that were using at least one of these three settings. The equivalent DATABASE_OPTIONS keys are &#39;driver, &#39;dsn&#39; and &#39;extra_params&#39; respectively.  </p>

<p>SVN trunk development follows closely Django development, so it needs a recent checkout of Django SVN trunk. On Jan 24, 2009 (r138) a django-1.0.x SVN branch was created, its main purpose is to remain compatible with the Django 1.0.x maintenance branch. </p>

<p>See our News page. </p>

<p>FeaturesWorks on Windows and Linux (using FreeTDS) Native Unicode support. Every string that goes in is stored as Unicode, and every string that goes out of the database is returned as Unicode. No conversion to/from intermediate encodings takes place, so things like max_length in CharField works just like expected. Limit/offset emulation supported in SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2000. Offset without limit emulation supported in SQL Server 2005. Both Windows Authentication (Integrated Security) and SQL Server Authentication supported. Passes most of the Django test suite. InstallationInstall pyodbc. Download django-pyodbc. Add the top directory of your django-pyodbc checkout to your PYTHONPATH. In your settings file set the DB engine to sql_server.pyodbc.

 title : The django-pyodbc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The django-qmanager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>QManager is an abstracted Django manager which filters via custom queries. </p>

<p>The QManager class is a subclass of django.db.models.Manager which can remove some of the boilerplate in manager definitions. Managers may be used to define &#39;table-level&#39; operations on your models, and one of their most common uses is to provide a pre-defined QuerySet for model data. The typical programming idiom goes something like this:      </p>

<p>  Define your custom manager as a subclass of django.db.models.Manager, overriding the get_query_set method to return a filtered query set. For example: </p>

<p>            class MyManager(models.Manager):
<br/>                def get_query_set(self):
<br/>                    return super(MyManager, self).get_query_set().filter(
<br/>                        field1=&#39;x&#39;, field2=&#39;y&#39;)  On your model, instantiate the manager. Following from the previous example:             class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>                field1 = models.CharField(...)
<br/>                field2 = models.CharField(...)
<br/>                ...
<br/>                objects = models.Manager() # Default manager instance.
<br/>                my_mgr = MyManager() # Custom manager instance.The problem with this pattern is that it ends up being repeated several times for each model as you try to define several useful custom managers for each type of data. The QManager class abstracts this idiom by providing a simple way of defining managers to return query sets. Now, what originally involved two parts is now down to one: </p>

<p>    class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>        field1 = models.CharField(...)
<br/>        field2 = models.CharField(...)
<br/>        ...
<br/>        objects = models.Manager()
<br/>        my_mgr = QManager(Q(field1=&#39;x&#39;, field2=&#39;y&#39;))As you can see, a custom manager is defined by passing QManager&#39;s __init__ method a Q object. Q objects are used in Django to specify queries of arbitrary complexity, and by using QManager you don&#39;t need to write all the boilerplate of the first example: all it takes is a simple Q object. </p>

<p>Another feature of Q instances is that they can be combined using the &amp; (and) and | (or) logical operators. These must not be the Python literal and and or operators, as these behave differently to the symbols. Let&#39;s say, for example, that you have two query sets defined by Q instances whose intersection (logical and) you want to find. Each of these query sets would be defined by an instance of Q, like so: </p>

<p>    query1 = Q(public=True)
<br/>    query2 = Q(confirmed=True)Each of these return query sets which contain those records which are public and confirmed, respectively. Such query sets would be obtained by calling the filter method on one of the model&#39;s managers (i.e. objects). Suppose you now want to find all the records which are both public and confirmed, in one query set. Typically, you would define a Q instance such as Q(public=True, confirmed=True), but this violates the DRY principle, as the same information is repeated. Instead, one may simply do this: </p>

<p>    query3 = query1 &amp; query2This is a shortcut which allows you to cut down the amount of extra code you write, and maintain DRY in your code. The QManager class provides a wrapper which lets you do the same thing in your manager definitions. An example might be: </p>

<p>    class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>        public = models.BooleanField()
<br/>        confirmed = models.BooleanField()
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = QManager(Q(public=True))
<br/>        confirmed_objects = QManager(Q(confirmed=True))
<br/>        public_confirmed = public_objects &amp; confirmed_objectsThis use of &amp; and | is not restricted to just QManager instances; Q objects, QuerySet instances and regular managers may all be combined with QManager instances via the logical operators. A caveat, however: in these statements, the QManager instance must come before anything else. It is valid, for example, to do this: </p>

<p>    public_confirmed = public_objects &amp; Q(confirmed=True)It is an error, however, to do the following: </p>

<p>    public_confirmed = Q(confirmed=True) &amp; public_objectsIt is advisable to ensure that errors like these do not happen, as they will be difficult to debug if they do: an error will most likely be raised somewhere in Django&#39;s codebase, rather than for QManager. </p>

<p>Another feature of query set manipulation is exclusion. QuerySet and Manager instances have exclude methods which, when called with a Q object, will return the set of all data not matching the conditions given in the query. This is called finding the complement of a set of data, and QManager instances support this through the negation operator (-). For example: </p>

<p>    class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = QManager(Q(public=True))
<br/>        non_public_objects = -public_objectsIf a reference to a QManager instance, whether through their definition (i.e. -QManager(...)) or a variable (i.e. -public_objects), is prepended with a - symbol, then it&#39;s __neg__ magic method will be called. In the case of QManager instances, this will return a new instance whose query is defined as the complement of the old query (Note on implementation: this is done via django.db.models.query.QNot). This may be used in conjunction with the other operators, for example: </p>

<p>    class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = QManager(Q(public=True))
<br/>        non_public_confirmed = confirmed_objects &amp; -public_objects
<br/>        non_confirmed_public = -confirmed_objects &amp; public_objectsA common design pattern which emerges when using QManager is the definition of queries which apply to several similar models. For example, if several of your models have public fields which are boolean flags telling whether or not a record is public, then you may want a manager to get only public records. Because, however, you are defining managers across several models, the query Q(public=True) will be repeated several times. If, one day, you decide to change the field to being called is_public, then each query will have to be edited individually. A typical set-up might look something like this: </p>

<p>    class A(models.Model):
<br/>        public = models.BooleanField()
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = QManager(Q(public=True))
<br/>    
<br/>    class B(models.Model):
<br/>        public = models.BooleanField()
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = QManager(Q(public=True))As you can see, because the managers are defined on different models they may not be reused. A simple way around this is to use the QManagerFactory function in this module. At the top of your models file (or a separate file for managers, if you wish), place the following line: </p>

<p>    PublicManager = QManagerFactory(Q(public=True), name=&#39;PublicManager&#39;)PublicManager will now be a class, with the name &#39;PublicManager&#39; (due to the name keyword), which is a subclass of QManager, and has the query attribute pre-defined as Q(public=True). On each model, you now only need to place the following: </p>

<p>    class A(models.Model):
<br/>        public = models.BooleanField()
<br/>        ...
<br/>        public_objects = PublicManager()And likewise for B. For more information on the QManagerFactory function, you are advised to consult its docstring and source code. </p>

<p>For more information, esp. implementation details, consult the source code. It may also be useful to look at the official Django documentation for the Q class and database API.</p>

 title : The django-rdf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Django-RDF is an RDF engine implemented in a generic, reusable Django app, providing complete RDF support to Django projects without requiring any modifications to existing framework or app source code, or incurring any performance penalty on existing control flow paths.  </p>

<p>The philosophy is simple: Do your web development using Django just like you&#39;re used to, then turn the knob and - with no additional effort - expose your project on the semantic web.  </p>

<p>The project home is at Google Code and there is also a Google Group to help coordinate.  </p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/django-rdf http://groups.google.com/group/django-rdf  Features  </p>

<p>Django-RDF can expose models from any other app as RDF data. This makes it easy to write new views that return RDF/XML data, and/or query existing models in terms of RDFS or OWL classes and properties using (a variant of) the SPARQL query language. SPARQL in, RDF/XML out - two basic semantic web necessities. </p>

<p>Django-RDF also implements an RDF store using its internal models such as Concept, Predicate, Resource, Statement, Literal, Ontology, Namespace, etc. The SPARQL query engine returns query sets that can freely mix data in the RDF store with data from existing Django models.  </p>

<p> Internals  </p>

<p>During configuration, the syncvb command inspects the database schema created by running syncdb and generates OWL ontologies for other apps in INSTALLED_APPS. The ontologies are serialized to RDF/XML files in the django-rdf/ontology/ directory, and subsequenty deserialized to create a combined vocabulary in the form of RDF model instances.  </p>

<p>The RDFS/OWL classes and properties in the vocabulary are associated with elements of the database schema that are then used by the SPARQL compiler to generate SQL code. A SPARQLQuerySet implementation wraps the compiler and provides access to model instances or values using the familiar Django query set interface - filter, count, iteration with slices, etc.  </p>

<p>A set of APIs gives convenient access to resources. Here is a toy example of a view that uses django.contrib.auth, resets the first name of a user and then renders everything known about that user in the RDF/XML format:   </p>

<p>def reset_first_name(request, username, first_name):
<br/>    AUTH = Namespace.objects.get(code=&#39;auth&#39;) 
<br/>    # Returns a django.contrib.auth.models.User object: 
<br/>    user = AUTH[&#39;user#%s&#39; % username]
<br/>    # Resets the first name of the user:
<br/>    Statement.objects.create(user, AUTH[&#39;User__first_name&#39;], first_name)
<br/>    # Renders everything known about the user in RDF/XML format:
<br/>    return render_as_rdf({resources: (user,)})A small set of shortcuts, templates and template tags simplifies RDF/XML output. An RDF/XML serializer/deserializer is also included. </p>

<p> Plan  </p>

<p>Django-RDF was initially implemented in March 2008. Current status as of April 25 2008 is as follows: </p>

<p>RDF store, basic SPARQL compiler and query set, render_as_rdf shortcut, RDF/XML deserializer, syncvb command are functional. URI synthesis for instances of existing models needs a rewrite. SPARQL implementation is missing features. SPARQL syntax is not compatible with the W3C Recommendation. No access control yet. No internationalization yet. No samples yet. ... and there are many other rough edges here and there.  The plan is to have a fairly polished &quot;ready-for-release&quot; version sometime in summer 2008. A fairly extensive set of unit tests already exists but there is still a lot of churn in various parts of the API, and the immediate goal is to extend the test coverage until the API reaches a more stable state. Feedback from the first intrepid users will be greatly appreciated! (And much of it will likely sound something like, hey, that&#39;s not working quite as advertised! :) </p>

<p>Enjoy, </p>

 title : The django-recipes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>My mom was writing a family cookbook using Microsoft Word and I thought this was a bad idea for several reasons. At first I thought about using LaTeX to separate the style from the content a bit, then I thought about using XML, then I settled on a database as being the most generic to store recipe data. I quickly decided on using Django to create this cookbook framework because Python is probably my strongest language and it makes creating custom websites really easy. </p>

<p>So far it includes: </p>

<p>Most important models, Recipe, Ingredient, Direction, Category, and a few more. Very nice admin interface for creating recipes with inline ingredients and directions. Front-end: only a recipe_list and recipe_detail so far, but the recipe_detail has an experimental method of displaying recipes that is based on this LaTeX style: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cooking/ (apparently based on style in a famous German cookbook by Dr. Oetker (Gromzik, J.; Reich, C.; Sander, C. (ed.): Dr. Oetker Schulkochbuch – Das Original. Ceres, Bielefeld, 1996.) </p>

<p>Competitors/related projects: </p>

<p>KRecipes - KDE-based desktop recipes software. Ben Collins-Sussman&#39;s effrecipes - Simple, but it works. Not under active development. Recipes on Rails - Ruby on Rails recipes site. Not open source as far as I know. Embeds &quot;Source: Recipes on Rails&quot; on all photos and has google ads. Great site though. One thing it has that my site lacks is per-direction photos. This would be easy to do. I already have per-direction ingredients. </p>

<p>If you are aware of any other similar projects please let me know. I am especially interested in any other web-based and open-source cookbook projects.</p>
 summary : <p>django-recommenderAboutdjango-recommender is a pluggable that provides methods to work with collective user intelligence. It is a set of methods for getting recommendations using the opinion (votes) of the users compared with the other users&#39; one. So instead of getting only the most popular items on the system, the user can also discover the items that can interest him more. It also may use tags for content based recommendation, i.e., direct matching. </p>

<p>Most of the algorithms are based on Toby Segaran&#39;s book &quot;Programming Collective Intelligence&quot;. </p>

<p>Before you startREQUIRED: This pluggable uses django-voting as basic system for user voting, and django-tagging for content-based recommendation, so they are required for its work. </p>

<p>WARNING: Don&#39;t use this plugable as it is with a huge amount of data, because it is really expensive in CPU and RAM. Instead, use caching or data clustering techniques for managing a limited set of data. </p>

<p>InstallationJust add &#39;recommender&#39; to your INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py project file. Run &quot;./manage.py syncdb&quot; and &quot;./manage.py test recommender&quot; to check the always interesting unit testing results. </p>

<p>Functionsget_best_items_for_user: This function will return a sorted list of pairs (value, item) containing the recommended items for a given user, based on the votes of the users.  get_similar_users: This function will tell us which are the most similar users, based on the historical votes for similar items. get_best_users_for_item: This function will return the best candidates that may like a given item, based on votes. get_similar_items: The closest items, based on the votes of the users. get_content_based_recs: Get recommendations using a Content Based distance calculation, using tags for items and users. cluster_users: Clustering function to get groups of similar users cluster_items: Clustering function to get groups of similar events How to use itIt&#39;s required to use it with django-voting and django-tagging pluggables. To use the functions, just invoke them through the manager of the Recommender class: Recommender.objects.get_best_items_for_user(user, users, movies) </p>

<p>The recommendable models must have been voted, using django-voting. And the user and the items should be tagged with django-tagging. </p>

<p>All these functions have as arguments the user or item to evaluate, a user list and an item list. This is because is can be useful to pass just a limited list of users or items, in order to have a better performance, or better results, focusing the recommendation only on a controlled set of data. </p>

<p>The result of the functions is a list of pairs (value, recommendation), where the value is a float indicating how close the recommendation is (1 is closest), and the recommendation will be the asked user or item. </p>

<p>In case of clustering functions, what it returns is a list containing other lists with the ids of the elements to cluster, i.e, if you want to have 3 clusters of users, the list will contain 3 sublists with the user ids of each cluster. </p>

<p>Have a look at the unit testing file tests.py to know more about the functions. </p>

 summary : <p>Rendertext is a Django app for using custom fonts on a web page for headings and the like without the use of Photoshop or Flash. </p>

<p>It does so by dynamically creating images out of text snippets. Both PNG and GIF output is currently supported. </p>

<p>Usage is simple. Rendertext provides the template filter rendertext which can be used like this: {{ myvar|rendertext:&quot;grunge&quot; }} to show myvar rendered with the font &quot;grunge&quot;. </p>

<p>You can easily configure size, color and rotations. For instance, {{ myvar|rendertext:&quot;grunge,16,#ff0000,45&quot; }} would show the text in size 16 with color red rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise. </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, django-rendertext checks if the image already has been rendered. If not, the font is loaded, a new image is generated and saved to disk. Then an  tag is returned with the URL to the image, alt text and width and height set. </p>

<p>You can take a look at the documentation. Or the news to see what&#39;s changed. </p>

<p>Rendertext is originally based on a snippet from djangosnippets.org. </p>

 summary : <p>A django application to build flexible, extensible reports through the web or as part of your views. </p>

<p>This project has been started due to interest on the django-users mailing list and very much subscribes to the &quot;release early and often&quot; philosophy. It is definitely not production ready, but this is an app that I think that users of django could benefit from, especially for those who are interfacing with legacy databases or in some sort of enterprise setting. </p>

<p>The idea is a central register which can easily tell you which fields are available for reports, and allows you to add to define your own reports in a sub-directory of your apps (much like the existing templatetags works). Here&#39;s an example from one of my app&#39;s report.py: </p>

<p>from nokia.reporting.helpers import FieldRegister
<br/>from datetime import timedelta
<br/>reg = FieldRegister()</p>

<p>@reg.register(&#39;Adjusted MTTR&#39;,&#39;Ticket&#39;,&#39;mttr&#39;)
<br/>def adjusted_mttr(ticket):
<br/>    &quot;&quot;&quot;The mean time to repair of the ticket&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>... rest of code body hereIn addition to the register, there are also a couple of Models (one for holding information on all the available fields, and one for your persistent Report objects) and these between them generate Reporter objects, which can produce CSV. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that I&#39;ve taken the right approach in all areas of the application, and I&#39;d very much like feedback and ideas, specifically: </p>

<p>The right way to persist the report objects, their construction is not really consistent and perhaps a relational database structure isn&#39;t the best means of storage. I&#39;m thinking that RDF or something similar (XML of some other sort) might be better? Testing... I&#39;m not really familiar with how to go about TDD, but i&#39;d like to learn! User interface, I&#39;m designing this to be brain dead (think dilbert manager ;-) ) simple to use. Presently this UI is dependant on Prototye, and I think this might hinder integrating it into admin views in the future. </p>

<p>Example code: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; fld_reg = FieldRegister()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; usr = fld_reg.User
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; #usr now has a representation of all of the fields the auth.User has, uncluding a
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; #count field for all of the FK and M2M relations and reverse relations:
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; usr
<br/>&gt;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; usr._fields #This is all of the User._meta.fields
<br/>[,
<br/>........
<br/>]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; usr.message_set</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; usr.message_set.title
<br/>&#39;Count of Message Set&#39;The best way to get to know the app is probably to install it, run syncdb, run generate_fields() (which is in helpers.py), and then have a play using ./manage.py shell. If you&#39;re using IPython you&#39;ll be up and running in no time.</p>

 summary : <p>This presents a convention that allows models to be displayed in certain ways </p>

<p>For instance, for a list of blog entries: diario/entry_archive_day.html ... {% represent entry as &quot;summary.html&quot; %} </p>

<p>diario/entry_archive.html ... {% represent entry as &quot;summary.html&quot; %} </p>

<p>diario/entry_detail.html ... {% represent entry as &quot;detail.html&quot; %} </p>

<p>Each template is placed in  representations/diario.entry/ </p>

<p>The power of this convention is revealed when you do something like a search engine that may be a list of different content types: </p>

<p>{% for object in search_result_list %} </p>

 title : The django-restful-model-views Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UpdateAs I explained in this blog post, I am suspending work on this project to support the work of Andreas Stuhlmueller who is going to be implementing a more comprehensive RESTful API for Django as part of the Google Summer of Code. As his work looks like the most promising implementation, and many of his ideas are compatible with mine, I would prefer to spend my time supporting him by providing feedback, testing releases, possibly contributing documentation, etc. rather than developing partially overlapping code. </p>

<p>If you are interested, here are some relevant links to Andreas&#39; proposal: </p>

<p>http://www.aiplayground.org/artikel/improving-django/ http://code.google.com/soc/django/appinfo.html?csaid=63138DE89788093 http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/bbdacc7a5ddb8f6e   </p>

<p>BackgroundAs someone who has been away from Python for a little while and is new to Django and to the REST philosophy, I only set out to better familiarize myself with Django and to better understand REST, not to create this contribution. However, this is where my exploration of Django and REST have taken me. The following blog posts chronicle this exploration and should provide insight into the approach taken here: </p>

<p>Toward a RESTful Approach to Django Applications Django REST Redux Test Driving a RESTful Django Contribution New contribution announcement: RESTful model views. Evolving a RESTful Django Contribution At this stage, I offer this contribution only as an attempted proof of concept, and leave it for more experienced Django developers to judge if this approach is sound. I have attempted to follow best practices for implementing pure REST--as much as pure REST can be implemented--and to do so in a way that is compatible with Django. However, at this point, the implemenation is incomplete, and hasn&#39;t been tested in a real application environment. </p>

<p>Installation and SetupStep 1: Checkout from Subversion: </p>

<p>  svn checkout http://django-restful-model-views.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ restful_model_views   Step 2: Copy or link this directory under django/contrib . </p>

<p>Step 3: In settings.py, separate the applications that should be RESTful: </p>

<p>  RESTFUL_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;mysite.myrestfulapp&#39;,
<br/>  )</p>

<p>  INSTALLED_APPS = RESTFUL_APPS + (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>  )   Step 4: In urls.py, add RESTful URL patterns: </p>

<p>  from django.contrib.restful_model_views.restful_urls import get_restful_patterns
<br/>  urlpatterns += get_restful_patterns()Step 5: Instead of a single views.py, create a directory called &#39;views&#39; in your RESTful application, and don&#39;t forget to add an empty __init__.py file under it, so Python knows it&#39;s a module. Now, for each model class that should have RESTful views, create a new module and class under views based on the name of the model. A minimal implementation for a model class called &#39;Items&#39; would contain this code in views/Items.py: </p>

<p>from mysite.myrestfulapp.models import Items
<br/>from django.contrib.restful_model_views.ModelResources import ModelResources, edit, create, dispatch</p>

<p>class Items(ModelResources):
<br/>  pass</p>

<p>  class Items_Member (ModelResources.ModelResources_Member):
<br/>    pass
<br/>This minimal implementation makes the underlying view methods in Resources available to Django for the model. You can refer to the django.contrib.restful_model_views.Resources module to see a full implemenation, otherwise, the basic structure of a RESTful model view looks like this: </p>

<p>  class Resources
<br/>    def GET(request):
<br/>      pass
<br/>    
<br/>    def POST(request):
<br/>      pass
<br/>    
<br/>    class Creator:
<br/>    
<br/>      def GET(self, request):
<br/>        pass
<br/>    
<br/>    class Resources_Member:
<br/>    
<br/>      def GET(self, request):
<br/>        pass
<br/>    
<br/>      def PUT(self, request):
<br/>        pass
<br/>    
<br/>      def DELETE(self, request):
<br/>        pass
<br/>    
<br/>      class Editor:
<br/>    
<br/>        def GET(self, request):
<br/>          passmap these methods to form actions Override any methods you need to customize. Otherwise, the default implemenations are designed to use generic views, so the appropriate templates need to be in the usual places. (Consult the Django generic views documentation if you don&#39;t know where these are.) Also note that to overload POST for PUT and DELETE operations, you will have to add a form element called &#39;_method&#39; with the appropriate values &#39;PUT&#39; or &#39;DELETE&#39;. </p>

<p>Development RoadmapThis contribution is currently in a &#39;proof of concept&#39; stage, although there are unit tests distributed with it, so what is there should at least work. Immediate/obvious work to do includes: </p>

<p>Implement appropriate default generic views for all methods in Resources and Resources_Member classes. Allow this approach to work with a standard views.py module, to accomodate the case in which perhaps only a few RESTful methods will be overridden. Simplify deployment so that even minimal view classes like the Items.py module mentioned above won&#39;t be necessary if only the default functionality of the Resources module is needed. (Maybe this can be done by dynamically adding the Resources module to views at runtime?) I may also try to find a way to add the RESTful urlpatterns automatically without having to add code to urls.py. The answer may be to make this a full-fledged middleware component within Django, but currently, I am not sure that is the correct route to take. The following are discussed in more detail in Evolving a RESTful Django Contribution: Refactor to decouple resource view class structure (with default raise Http404 implementations) from ORM/generic view code. This will allow for more flexible definition of resources when they don&#39;t directly map to models. Along with the above refactoring, add more specifications options, such as specifying a list of resource names or a dictionary of resource names mapped optionally to model classes. Consider looking for this in urls.py as well as keeping the current RESTFUL_APPS approach in settings.py. Implement direct dispatching to PUT and DELETE methods instead of just relying on overloading post. Implement something like respond_to in Rails. Implement something similar to link_to, form_tag and form_for in Rails. Change &#39;_action&#39; to &#39;_method&#39;. Add service discovery views/templates. Look into ATOM Publishing Protocol, WADL, etc. </p>

 title : The django-seasonal-stylesheets Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-seasonal-stylesheets is a goofy little project that I started as a result of a discussion I had with some co-workers.  We were talking about making our organization&#39;s website change the way it looked depending on what time of year it was.  That night I couldn&#39;t sleep because of my allergies, so I decided to see what I could do in a short amount of time to make our discussion a possibility (though it will never become a reality). </p>

<p>By the morning I had a pretty functional application that would change the color of various elements on the page based on the date.  It does this using CSS.  I&#39;m not sure that this application will ever become overly popular, but I&#39;m hoping that someone a little more creative than me will figure out a way to make it useful. </p>

<p>Basically, all you do is create a stylesheet that can have any number of seasons associated with it.  Each season can have an unlimited number of variable colors associated with it, but you should have the same variables defined in each season for a particular stylesheet.  Depending on the day of the year, the application selects the most recently past season and the soonest to come season.  It then determines how to transition each variable color from the past season to the coming season.  Sometimes you can get some pretty funky color combinations, but you can always add a new season in between to mitigate the funkiness. </p>

<p>RequirementsThis project was built with and requires at least Django 1.0 (though you could probably get away with any of the SVN versions since mid-July 2008). </p>

<p>InstallationDownload django-seasonal-stylesheets using one of the following methods: </p>

<p>Checkout from Subversionsvn co http://django-seasonal-stylesheets.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-seasonal-stylesheetsPackage DownloadDownload the latest .tar.gz file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you&#39;ll remember.  After extraction, execute the following command: </p>

<p>python setup.py installConfigurationFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.admin&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.contenttypes&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sessions&#39;,
<br/>    &#39;django.contrib.sites&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>    &#39;dsss&#39;,
<br/>    ...
<br/>)Run manage.py syncdb.  This creates a few tables in your database that are necessary for operation. </p>

<p>Currently, the only option for this application is DSSS_SAVE.  This setting allows you to specify whether or not you want the stylesheets to be saved to the filesystem for faster retrieval in the future.  Default: True </p>

<p>Next, you must include the URLconf for this project somewhere.  You can put a line like the following in your root urls.py: </p>

<p>    (r&#39;^seasonal/&#39;, include(&#39;dsss.urls&#39;)),UsageAll you really need to do is modify your templates to include a link to the special stylesheet.  Assuming I have a stylesheet with the slug sample, I could do this: </p>

<p>By default, the application looks in [template directory]/dsss/[slug].css for the template of a particular stylesheet.  You may override the template location if you so desire, but it should be somewhere in your template directories (as defined in your settings.py file). </p>

<p>A sample template follows: </p>

<p>body {
<br/>    background-color: {{ background }};
<br/>}</p>

<p>h1 {
<br/>    color: {{ header1 }};
<br/>}</p>

<p>h2 {
<br/>    color: {{ header2 }};
<br/>}This template assumes that my stylesheet has 3 variables: background, header1, and header2.  These are the names of the variables setup in the admin interface. </p>

<p>Good luck!  Please contact me with any questions or concerns you have with the project!</p>
 summary : <p>secureurlA Django application that protects content from unauthorized access. </p>

<p>What secureurl doesThis application makes it easy to add security tokens to the end of URLs. Tokens are simply hashes of session key and/or timestamps. These tokens can be checked by a view decorator. It also contains a mod_python access handler to check security tokens. Access without the correct session cookie will result in a 403 Forbidden error. </p>

<p>Security token can tie URLs to sessions and/or timestamps. </p>

<p>Situations is which secureurl could be used: </p>

 title : The django-secureurl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The django-seeker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Getting StartedOut of the box, django-seeker supports building a filter-based search interface driven from a django model. To get started, we&#39;ll walk through adding a search interface for a model to an existing project. Keep in mind that the backend is pluggable, allowing you to write code to search on any data model. </p>

<p>PrerequisitesjQuery json2.js jQuery UI Datepicker jQuery Form Plugin (for AJAX file imports) URLsIncluding the seeker application is easy: </p>

<p>from seeker.plugins.model import ModelSearchPlugin</p>

<p>params = {
<br/>    &#39;plugin&#39;: ModelSearchPlugin(MyModel),
<br/>    &#39;base_template&#39;: &#39;search.html&#39;,
<br/>}</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,
<br/>    ( r&#39;^search/&#39;, include(&#39;seeker.urls&#39;), params ),
<br/>    ...
<br/>)The base_template parameter is the name of a template that the seeker template will derive from. By default, it looks for a template named search.html. This allows you to embed the search interface into your site using your own base template. The base template can also take care of including the required CSS and javascript files. </p>

<p>There is also a media_url parameter to specify the location of the images that seeker needs to load. By default, media_url defaults to settings.MEDIA_URL + &#39;/images/seeker/&#39;, so if your MEDIA_URL was set to http://media.mysite.com, media_url would be http://media.mysite.com/images/seeker/. We&#39;ll get into media more below. </p>

<p>MediaSeeker relies on some external javascript libraries, as well as it&#39;s own javascript code. As mentioned before, including these files in a base template makes things very easy. Your base template (search.html in the example above) may look something like this: </p>

<p>{% extends &quot;site_base.html&quot; %}</p>

<p>{% block extra_head %}</p>

<p>{% endblock %}</p>

<p>{% block content %}</p>

<p>{% block seeker %}
<br/>{% endblock %}</p>

<p>{% endblock %}In this template, jquery.js was not included, since it was already included as part of the site_base.html template. You&#39;ll notice that we override the content block, and set up a seeker block -- this is where the interface will be rendered. This template also assumes that you have either copied or symlinked the necessary files into the appropriate MEDIA_ROOT directories. Basically, as long as all the required files are included, seeker doesn&#39;t care how you get them there. </p>

<p>CustomizationThe interface is fully customizable using CSS. You can also customize the HTML by using your own template, and passing template_name as a parameter when you include the URL configuration. </p>

<p>As of r7, you can create an inner Search class (much like Meta) to define excluded fields, initially displayed fields, and follow relationships. For example: </p>

<p>class OtherModel (models.Model):
<br/>    data1 = models.CharField( max_length=100 )
<br/>    data2 = models.CharField( max_length=100 )</p>

<p>class MyModel (models.Model):
<br/>    label = models.CharField( max_length=100 )
<br/>    status = models.ForeignKey( Status )
<br/>    active = models.BooleanField()
<br/>    other_info = models.ForeignKey( OtherModel )</p>

<p>    class Search:
<br/>        exclude = (&#39;active&#39;,&#39;other_info__data2&#39;)
<br/>        initial = (&#39;label&#39;,&#39;status&#39;,&#39;other_info__data1&#39;)
<br/>        follow = (&#39;other_info&#39;,)Note that you can exclude related fields from being searched/displayed, as well as specifying related fields to be initially displayed. The follow argument tells ModelSearchPlugin that fields from the related model should also be included for search/display. If the followed model has a Search inner class, those rules as respected as well. </p>

<p>Caching and PerformanceBy default, the ModelSearchPlugin uses Django&#39;s cache system to cache result sets. This is controllable by the cache_results and cache_time properties on the plugin object. </p>

<p>As of r7, the ModelSearchPlugin takes an optional select_depth argument, which defaults to 1. This is passed as the depth argument to select_related(). Ideally, it should be set to the maximum depth of any related fields that are available as display fields. This will greatly improve performance when rendering and sorting result sets.</p>

In your projects urls.py file add in the following url:  (r&#39;^simplepages/&#39;, include(&#39;simplepages.urls&#39;)),  At this point the html editor and the prepopulating for the urls should be working. One more step is required for the edit this page functionality to appear on the site. Paste the below (also included in the sample_base.html template) into the bottom of your base.html template. </p>

<p>{% if user.is_staff %}
<br/>    {# Determining if we should load the javascript for displaying admin links #}
<br/>    
<br/>{% endif %}Make sure to update the location to point to your admin media folder if it&#39;s not the &#39;admin&#39; subdirectory of your media_url. </p>

<p>Everything should be setup and working now. If the rich text editor, the edit page or the prepopulate aren&#39;t working it&#39;s most likely due to incorrect paths to the javascript files so they aren&#39;t being loaded. </p>

<p>What Simple pages doesn&#39;t doIt is not a full featured cms it only manages pages and it does that at a fairly simple level. The menu hierarchy is only one level, site section to pages. This can be extended to allow additional levels of links or even unlimited levels, but you&#39;d have to code up that capability.</p>

<p>STATUS: Work in Progress, Unworking, UnsupportedRequirementsDjango (Trunk)</p>
 summary : <p>django-slots allows arbitrary Django models to be scheduled against one another, with time as a feature of that relationship.  The relationship can either start at a particular time, until the next change occurs: this is called a transition; or the relationship can occur explicitly between a start and end time: this is called a slot.  Think of them both as time-based foreign keys. </p>

<p>Some documentationNone of the documentation mentions transitions, which is a pain in the arse because they are actually more fully featured (eg, you can use them in the admin).  It&#39;s possible the code is simple and well documented/commented enough that its usage can be figured out without documentation. </p>

<p>This documentation, therefore, is related to slots.  Note that the patterns used when writing transitions has lead me to think that the slots approach is daft and can be simplified.  In particular the GenericIntermediaries stuff is properly overkill, as well as being the number one reason why an admin interface never sprang into life.  Nonetheless this stuff might be useful anyway: </p>

<p>Introducing django-slots is, as the name suggests, an introduction to what this project is about. There is a very terse guide to getting django-slots up and running.  Slots and schedules are also explained in a little more depth. Generic intermediaries, the mechanism which underlies the implementation of slots, is documented too. django-slots was started by Darren Foreman. The code is released under a BSD license, and is © Darren Foreman 2008.</p>

 title : The django-sms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-smsdjango-sms is a Django application designed to make sending SMS text messages as simple as sending an email.  </p>

<p>version 0.1 was released 2008-11-12. </p>

<p>QuickstartAdd sms to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: </p>

<p>    INSTALLED_APPS = (
<br/>        # apps
<br/>        &#39;sms&#39;,
<br/>    )  Get in sync to update the database and install the provided Carrier fixtures: </p>

<p>    python manage.py syncdb  And play with some code: </p>

<p>    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
<br/>    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
<br/>    from sms.models import Carrier, ContentTypePhoneNumber, OutboundMessage
<br/>    from sms.util import send_sms</p>

<p>    # get a user
<br/>    matt = User.objects.get(username=&quot;matt&quot;)</p>

<p>    # get matt&#39;s cell phone carrier (at&amp;t)
<br/>    att = Carrier.objects.get(pk=7)</p>

<p>    # attach a phone number to matt
<br/>    matts_phone_number, created = ContentTypePhoneNumber.objects.get_or_create(
<br/>        content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(User),
<br/>        object_id = matt.pk,
<br/>        carrier = att,
<br/>        phone_number = &quot;123-123-1234&quot;
<br/>    )</p>

<p>    # do stuff (probably very important!!!!) ...</p>

<p>    # send matt an sms
<br/>    send_sms(
<br/>        msg = &quot;omg im texting from python!&quot;,
<br/>        from_address = &quot;mattdennewitz@gmail.com&quot;,
<br/>        recipient_list = [matts_phone_number],
<br/>        fail_silently = False
<br/>    )     </p>

<p>How Do I Make This Work?SMS messages are sent with the sms.util.send_sms function, which is nearly identical to django.core.mail.send_mail. The key differences are that message subjects are not accepted and the recipient_list argument should be a list of ContentTypePhoneNumber objects. </p>

<p>django-sms provides two three models for users to work with: </p>

<p> Carrier, which represents the email-to-sms gateway provided by service providers. 61 carriers are provided for you in the fixtures, which should cover most everyone&#39;s needs. 
<br/>2. ContentTypePhoneNumber, which provides: 
<br/>     </p>

<p>phone number storage description of phone number - optional, meant for &#39;home&#39; or &#39;work&#39; &#39;primary phone number&#39; definition - optional, useful if you use this for contact storage      ContentTypePhoneNumber also has a custom manager, PhoneNumberManager, which allows 
<br/>for User lookups via ContentTypePhoneNumber.objects.get_for_user(user_obj). This manager 
<br/>will probably be fleshed out later, but thats it for now. </p>

<p>3. OutboundMessage, which acts as a message log. When a message is sent with sms.util.send_sms, 
<br/>the Carrier, ContentTypePhoneNumber and dispatch time are logged. This is for pulling usage 
<br/>information for both Carriers and ContentTypePhoneNumbers.  
<br/>      </p>

<p>To pull data from the OutboundMessage logs, check out OutboundMessageManager. It has two helpers 
<br/>now, but will also probably be expanded in the future: 
<br/>      most_popular_carriers, which pulls the most popular carriers in a given (optional) date range most_contacted_numbers, which pulls the most popular phone numbers is a given (optional) date range       See their documentation for more. </p>

<p>What&#39;s ComingSignals. Maybe. Forms, if people request such. Seems like a ModelForm for the Carriers should suffice for now. Requests?       </p>

<p>Words of Advice The data used in the fixtures was culled from Wikipedia. I didn&#39;t ask first, so I&#39;m sorry for any toes I may have stepped on. Also, keep in mind that phone service providers are liable to shut off these services or make changes to format, rate limit, etc. on a whim and without notice. If you encounter any trouble, report them and we&#39;ll see what can happen.</p>

 summary : <p>The economic relationships are based on the REA (Resources, Events and Agents) model: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources_Events_Agents </p>

<p>REA has the virtue of supporting any economic relationships, not limited to formal companies or money.  For example, whuffie accounting for open-source software projects (see obols below) or barter among friends (see swaps below). </p>

<p>(But of course it will also support the usual economic relationships within a company but also across companies or among members of an LLC or joint venture.  In other words, it&#39;s very flexible.) </p>

<p>While the code will eventually be usable for any Django project, at first it is targeted at Pinax and the Django Hotclub: http://code.google.com/p/django-hotclub/ </p>

<p>ObolsImaginary currency given between project members for project contributions. </p>

<p>Current state: once worked with pinax, probably doesn&#39;t any more with all the recent changes both to pinax and django trunk. </p>

<p>Has been neglected recently in favor of Swaps.  </p>

<p>If you want to work with it, you could add obols to django-hotclub/apps  </p>

<p>Then add this to projects/urls.py: </p>

<p>url(r&#39;^(?P\w+)/obols/&#39;, include(&#39;obols.urls&#39;), kwargs=wiki_args),And this somewhere in templates/projects/project.html: </p>

 title : The django-socialblog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The django-spambayes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Django-SpamBayes includes a few utility apps for Django that offer an easy to use interface to the SpamBayes statistical anti-spam filter allowing filtering and moderation (with training) of comments, contact forms and other publicly submitted data. </p>

<p>Note: These apps do not depend on any of the e-mail client plugins (i.e.: Outlook plugin) available from the SpamBayes project. However, the core spambayes python package needs to be installed on your PYTHONPATH. It is recommended that you download and install a recent &quot;source release&quot; of SpamBayes appropriate for your platform. </p>

<p>Apps:djangobayesThe &quot;djangobayes&quot; app is the workhorse that gets Django and SpamBayes to talk to each other. It contains a Django model for SpamBayes to store its &#39;learned&#39; data in and a SpamBayes Classifier subclass that wraps the Django model. This is all wrapped up in a SpamBayes Hammie instance (djangobayes.filter.filter) which contains the public API accessed by other apps.  </p>

<p>Basic Usage: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from djangobayes.filter import filter
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; score = filter.score(&#39;some text&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; if score &lt; 0.3:
<br/>...     # do something with spam
<br/>... elif score &gt; 0.8:
<br/>...     # do something with ham
<br/>... else:
<br/>...     # unsure - do something elseOf course, this will only work if SpamBayes has been trained. To train do: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.train(&#39;some spam&#39;, True)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.store()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.train(&#39;some ham&#39;, False)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.store()In some situations you may want to filter based on more than a single body of text. For example, an author&#39;s name, e-mail address, IP address, etc. As SpamBayes is intended for filtering e-mail, you can pass in a message object rather than a plain string. djangobayes provides a handy shortcut, build_msg which excepts a body and any keywords you provide to build a message. For example: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from djangobayes.filter import build_msg
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = build_msg(&#39;some text&#39;, author=&#39;Bob&#39;, email=&#39;bob@example.com&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; score = filter.score(msg)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; # or ...
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = build_msg(&#39;body text&#39;, **{&#39;name&#39; : &#39;Sue&#39;, &#39;ip&#39; : &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;})
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.train(msg)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.store()As far as I can tell, SpamBayes doesn&#39;t really care what the names of the keywords are as long as they are consistent throughout your app. It simply sees them as e-mail headers and doesn&#39;t give any particular headers more weight than others. That&#39;s why the primary text must be passed in separately. </p>

<p>As this is a SpamBayes API, see the SpamBayes documentation (and read the code) for more information. </p>

<p>commentbayesAn add-on to the django.contrib.comments app that adds SpamBayes filtering. Requires &quot;djangobayes&quot; to be installed in the project. commentbayes simply uses signals to add scoring and training to django.contrib.comments moderation. </p>

<p>commentbayes supports two optional settings to indicate the ham and spam thresholds. Each should be a floating point number between 0 and 1: </p>

<p>HAM_LEVEL (default is 0.3) SPAM_LEVEL (default is 0.8) </p>

<p>Assuming you have already installed django.contrib.comments, add commentbayes and djangobayes to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py file, run manage.py syncdb (to add the djangobayes table) and your all set. All future comments will be run through the SpamBayes filter. Any comment with a score greater than SPAM_LEVEL will be marked for deletion (comment.is_removed = True), any comment with a score equal to or between HAM_LEVEL and SPAM_LEVEL will be marked for moderation (comment.is_public = False), and any comment with a score less than HAM_LEVEL will be marked as ham. </p>

<p>To train SpamBayes, point your browser at http://yourdomain.com/comments/moderate/ (an undocumented part of django.contrib.comments) and either &#39;approve&#39; or &#39;remove&#39; the comments awaiting moderation. In a short time and with good training, you will be enjoying spam-free comments! </p>

<p>You may want to set up a cron job to remove comments marked for deletion (comment.is_removed = True) on occasion. </p>

<p>sb_demoThe &quot;sb_demo&quot; app is a very simple demonstration that provides a single page of comments with feedback on the SpamBayes scoring. This app does not use Django&#39;s forms or various other mechanisms that would make is useful for others. It&#39;s simply a demonstration that filtering works - mostly. </p>

<p>It also adds a very basic template for flatpages with comments enabled which provides a demo of commentbayes. </p>

<p>GAE BranchThe gae branch in the repo is an early semi-working version of the code for Google App Engine and BigTable. The file sb.py is essentially the same as the sbayes app above, but for BigTable. I&#39;m not currently using or maintaining this branch, but it&#39;s available for anyone who wants it.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>[...]Previous template syntax is new in release 7, because of the file storage refactoring, that changed the way that FileField attributes are accessed. For previous versions the syntax {{ object.myimage }} and {{ object.myimage_thumbnail }} should be used. </p>

<p>About image namesStdImageField stores images in filesystem modifying its name. Renamed name is set using field name, and object primary key. Also it changes old windows &quot;jpg&quot; extesions to standard &quot;jpeg&quot;. </p>

<p>Using image5 field previously defined (that creates a thumbnail), if an image called myimage.jpg is uploaded, then resulting images on filesystem would be (supose that this image belongs to a model with pk 14): </p>

<p>Flickr (http://flickr.com) Youtube (http://youtube.com) del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us) Twitter (http://twitter.com) ma.gnolia (http://ma.gnolia.com) Picasaweb (http://picasaweb.google.com) Readernaut (http://readernaut.com) Brightkite (http://brightkite.com)   Additional web services can be added easily. Suggestions for more services and/or patches welcome. </p>

<p>For an excellent example of django-syncr in action, check out Martin Geber&#39;s custom memory stream on his homepage. </p>

<p>Latest version: r47UPDATE 12/14/2008 Merged in a ton of Flickr patches and repackaged r47 into download archive labeled version 0.41. There&#39;s a ton of great changes (thanks Martin Geber). For a list of new features, examine the change log. This WILL be backwards incompatible because the models contain a richer set of data fields, so watch out.   </p>

<p>Previous UpdatesUPDATE 12/12/2008 Have packaged the lastest svn code into a downloadable archive labeled v0.40. It includes all the apps listed above and works on Django 1.0. Not sure what the status of the previous archive was, but it was certainly far out of date. </p>

<p>UPDATE 10/28/2008 Just checked in several bug fixes and flagged some feature requests for addition to the app. </p>

<p>Also, if you have ideas for django-syncr modules you&#39;d like to see added or want to implement, leave comments on the SyncrRequest wiki page. </p>

<p>UPDATE 9/20/2008 Have merged in support for ma.gnolia bookmarking service and picasaweb photo sharing (thanks yashh and v.oostveen!) Also fixed a few bugs related to the 1.0 update. These are in subversion release... please test and let us know how things are working for you. </p>

<p>UPDATE 8/5/2008 Django syncr&#39;s SVN version now supports ma.gnolia thanks to yash and new forms admin is now supported thanks to jblount. Several other bug fixes are implemented (see issues tab). Thanks to everyone who sent in patches! </p>

<p>UPDATE 4/17/2008 New version available in svn and in archive file format (0.35). This should fix, hopefully, all of the problems people have been having with Flickr. Please test and let me know and thanks for the feedback! Also note that you should be running Beej&#39;s flickrapi version 1.1 for flickr support. </p>

<p>UPDATE 4/15/2008: Sorry for the lack of updates. I have made several fixes from issues people reported and update the subversion repository. I suggest using the svn checkout instead of the packaged zip files for now. Thanks for the feedback, feel free to email me or look me up on twitter with suggestions. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>DEPENDENCIESEach syncr app has different dependencies, but generally you need Element Tree. ET is included in Python 2.5, but for older versions you need to download it from http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm. You also need to have django-tagging installed in your INSTALLED_APPS and on PYTHONPATH. See http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/ </p>

<p>The twitter app depends on python-twitter, available at: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/ </p>

<p>The flickr app depends on Beej&#39;s Python flickrapi v1.1, available at: http://flickrapi.sourceforge.net/ </p>

<p>INSTALLATION / USAGEDownload the most recent tar file or check out the code:  svn checkout http://django-syncr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ syncr  
<br/>Add the syncr app to your PYTHONPATH. Modify your Django settings file by adding the appropriate modules to your INSTALLED_APPS. Available Django apps are: &#39;syncr.flickr&#39; &#39;syncr.youtube&#39; &#39;syncr.twitter&#39; &#39;syncr.delicious&#39; Use the interfaces provided in syncr.app to write scripts for synchronizing your web service data with the Django backend. For example:

 title : The django-todo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>django-todo 1.1 is a multi-user, multi-group task management and assignment system for the Django web application framework. Includes drag and drop task prioritization (via jquery) and email task notification. Can be used for something as simple as personal GTD tracking or as complex as an organizational ticketing/tracking system. </p>

<p>The assumption is that your organization/publication/company has multiple groups of employees, each with multiple users. Users may belong to multiple groups, and each group can have multiple todo lists. </p>

<p>Users can view and modify all to-do lists belonging to their group(s).  Only users with is_staff() can delete lists.  </p>

<p>You must have at least one Group set up in Django admin, and that group must have at least one User as a member. This is true even if you&#39;re the sole user of django-todo.  </p>

<p>Identical list names can exist in different groups, but not in the same group. </p>

<p>Emails are generated to the assigned-to person when new tasks are created.  </p>

<p>Comment threads can be added to tasks. Each participant in a thread receives email when new comments are added. </p>

 title : The django-treemenus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Django Tree Menus </p>

<p>This is a simple and generic tree-structured menuing system for Django with an easy-to-use admin interface. It covers all the essentials for building tree-structured menus and should be enough for a lot of projects. However it is easily extendable if you need to add some special behaviour. </p>

<p>Please note: django-treemenus requires Django 1.0 or a recent Subversion checkout of Django. It will not work on Django 0.96. </p>

<p>Full documentation is included in the package or directly accessible: here. Some sample templates are also provided in the package to get you started. </p>

<p>Change logv0.8.6 - 23/01/2010: Small update to make it compatible with Django 1.2. Also fixed some packaging issues from 0.8.5 </p>

<p>v0.8.5 - 21/01/2010: Minor updates (tests and doc fixes, and updated some locales) </p>

<p>v0.8 - 14/03/2009: Few small fixes. There are no backward incompatibilities in this release, but it is recommended to upgrade especially if you use recent development versions of Django. </p>

<p>v0.7.2 - 01/10/2008: Fixed a small edge-case bug and slightly improved the admin interface . </p>

<p>v0.7.1 - 29/09/2008: Fixed a small bug when deleting menu items. </p>

<p>v0.7 - 16/09/2008: A few small bugs fixed. This release generally brings a lot of robustness. Even if your data (ranks, levels, etc.) were corrupted, they should automatically be repaired after saving the faulty menu items. Please also note a few deprecated methods here. </p>

<p>v0.6 - 08/08/2008: Major refactor of the codebase to better fit New-Forms-Admin&#39;s API. Few and easily manageable backward incompatible changes are described here. </p>

<p>v0.5 - 22/07/2008: Upgraded code so it works after the merge of the Newforms-Admin branch (Keep using version 0.4 if you haven&#39;t upgraded your own code to newforms-admin). Also added German locale kindly provided by Thomas Kerpe. </p>

<p>v0.4 - 26/05/2008: New languages added: Russian (thanks maxim.oransky), dutch (thanks v.oostveen), and French. You can send me your translations and I&#39;ll include them in future releases. </p>

<p>v0.3 - 05/03/2008: Added a new section in the documentation &quot;Tips and tricks&quot;, and fixed a small bug as described in this issue. </p>

<p>v0.2.2 - 15/02/2008: Fixed another small bug as in previous release. </p>

<p>v0.2.1 - 15/02/2008: Fixed a bug as described in this issue. </p>

<p>v0.2 - 14/02/2008: Added a clean and generic way to extend and customize menu items. Have a look at the manual to see how it works. </p>

 title : The django-uploadutils Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>With the successful merge of #2070, there are several interesting possibilities that open up in the way of uploading. </p>

<p>This project attempts to package a few of the most common use cases in a Django app. </p>

<p>I will set out to package the following use cases first: </p>

<p>Global upload limit (per upload) User-based upload limit (Quota for all uploaded files) Uploading large images and resizing them without using memory. AJAX Upload progress bar widget. An S3 uploader (using boto)</p>
 title : The django-urls Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Experimental replacement for Django&#39;s get_absolute_url method, as described on ReplacingGetAbsoluteUrl. </p>

<p>For the moment I&#39;ve implemented it as a mixin class. Here&#39;s how you use it: </p>

<p>from django.db import models
<br/>from django_urls.base import UrlMixin</p>

<p>class ArticleWithPathDefined(models.Model, UrlMixin):
<br/>    slug = models.SlugField()
<br/>    
<br/>    def get_url_path(self):
<br/>        return &#39;/articles/%s/&#39; % self.slug</p>

<p>class AssetWithUrlDefined(models.Model, UrlMixin):
<br/>    domain = models.CharField(max_length=30)
<br/>    filename = models.CharField(max_length = 30)
<br/>    
<br/>    def get_url(self):
<br/>        return &#39;http://%s/assets/%s&#39; % (self.domain, self.filename)You need to define either get_url_path or get_url on a model - there&#39;s no need to define both. If you define one, the other will magically start working. Here&#39;s an example session using the above models: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; article = ArticleWithPathDefined.objects.create(slug = &#39;my-article&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; article.get_url()
<br/>&#39;http://localhost/articles/my-article/&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; article.get_url_path()
<br/>&#39;/articles/my-article/&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; asset = AssetWithUrlDefined.objects.create(domain=&#39;example.com&#39;, filename=&#39;logo.png&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; asset.get_url()
<br/>&#39;http://example.com/assets/logo.png&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; asset.get_url_path()
<br/>&#39;/assets/logo.png&#39;</p>

 title : The django-webapp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is unmaintained; there are better ways of doing this, like django-piston. This project will be removed in January 2010. </p>

<p>Like Django itself, this code came up out of necessity: I was writing a quick single-page AJAXy app and came up with a few techniques and patterns to make that easy. After refining them some, I&#39;ve decided to release them to the world. Hopefully they&#39;ll make your web development fast and easy. </p>

<p>The design was inspired by the simplicity of CherryPy coupled with the explicit expressiveness and extensibility of Django itself. You can use this code as-is, but you&#39;ll get the most benefit from reading it carefully and subclassing it to get the results you want. </p>

<p>A core idea is using class methods as views. The type dispatch allows for flexible subclassing. </p>

<p>Includes: </p>

<p>extensible REST-ish Resource class, simpler than django-rest-interface (but lacking some of its features) class-based HTTP method dispatching easy AJAXy APIs transparent JSON serialization AJAX-friendly error handling </p>

<p>I am working on a blog mini-series that uses this code to make a small app. </p>

<p>Code is now available; documentation coming soon.</p>

<p>We provide a simple framework to make this easier. You can create your own widgets easily, or can use the widgets we made. In this time, we support widgets written with ExtJS. </p>

<p>A glance of widget usage: </p>

<p>{% load Widget %}
<br/>  {% formWidget %}
<br/>  {
<br/>   &#39;strategy&#39;: &#39;wforms&#39;,

 title : The django-yui-layout-templates Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Django layout templates using the Yahoo UI libraryThis project provides a set of default Django template layouts using the Yahoo UI library CSS tools (Grids, Font, Reset, Base).  Just svn export to help you get you along your way with using the Django framework and/or Google App Engine. </p>

<p>Supported Yahoo UI versions: </p>

<p>2.4.1 2.5.2 2.6.0 Also included are the following 8 layouts: </p>

<p>1 column - full page width 2 column - narrow left column (size of column can be changed) 2 column - narrow right column (size of column can be changed) 2 column - equal width columns 3 column - equal width columns 3 column - varying width columns (size of columns can be changed) 3 column - 1/4 - 1/2 - 1/4 4 column - equal width columns There is also a base layout included in the layouts directory that contains all the defaults.   </p>

<p>Feel free to add your comments or suggest a better (or another) layout! </p>

<p>Installation Django Google App Engine Usage Overriding Tips Links Installation(If you&#39;re using anything &lt; the latest Yahoo UI, check out the branches directory - this is where all the template layouts will be maintained.  I&#39;ll try to match trunk to the latest Yahoo UI library.) </p>

<p>DjangoExport the layouts and install them in a directory where the Django templating system can find them.  (I typically install them in project_name/templates/main_site/layouts/). </p>

<p>The source code can be accessed by performing a Subversion export. For example, the following command will export the application&#39;s source code out to a templates directory: </p>

<p>svn export http://django-yui-layout-templates.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ templatesBe sure to check the branches directory for any version &lt; the latest Yahoo UI trunk </p>

<p>Google App EngineExport the layouts and install them in a directory named templates inside of your project directory. </p>

<p>The source code can be accessed by performing a Subversion export. For example, the following command will export the application&#39;s source code out to a templates directory: </p>

<p>svn export http://django-yui-layout-templates.googlecode.com/svn/branches/VERSION_HERE templatesThe Google App Engine versions will only live in the branches directory. </p>

<p>UsageTo use the layouts, you&#39;ll have to do 3 things.   </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve exported the the files from svn, there should be a file called  &#39;layout_overrides.html&#39;.  If not, create one in your main template directory. The base layout expects a file called &#39;header.html&#39; and &#39;footer.html&#39; in a directory called shared somewhere in your template path.  If you don&#39;t have this directory, either create one or keep reading to learn how to override the &#39;base_layout.html&#39; settings. (Thanks akaihola!)   Extend one of the provided Django template layouts in your template.  {% extends &#39;layouts/layout_2_equal_columns.html&#39; %}To add content to these layouts, there is a standardization on the block name you need to override in your templates.  The name of the block to add content to will be the column number (from left to right).  Using the example above, to add content to a layout, you&#39;ll have to put the following in one of your templates: </p>

<p>{% extends &#39;layouts/layout_2_equal_columns.html&#39; %}</p>

<p>{% block 1 %}
<br/>Left Column
<br/>{% endblock 1 %}</p>

<p>{% block 2 %}
<br/>Right Column
<br/>{% endblock 2 %}
<br/>As you can see, block 1 is the left column, block 2 is the right column.  For a 3 column layout, block 1 would be the left column, block 2 would be the center column, and block 3 would be the right column. (Not too hard. :P). </p>

<p>OverridesTo override any of the layout defaults, just place them in the layout_overrides.html file.  To see what you can override, take a look at layout_base.html.  As an example, you might want to override where the Yahoo UI css files are loaded from.  Currently, they&#39;re loaded from the Yahoo servers, but you might want to load it from your own CDN.  Taking a look at layout_base.html, you&#39;ll see the following: </p>

<p>{% block css.shared %}
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>{% endblock css.shared %}To override this default, just put the following in the layout_overrides.html file. </p>

<p>{% block css.shared %}
<br/>     
<br/>     
<br/>{% endblock css.shared %}Of course, this will override this default for all your layouts.  To override them in specific templates, just place the above code in your own template file. </p>

<p>TipsTo remove spaces from your templates, inside one of your templates, you&#39;ll want to do something like the following: </p>

<p>{% block layout.base %}{% spaceless %}{{block.super}}{% endspaceless %}{% endblock layout.base %}External LinksTo read more about how to configure the templates for Django, see the Django Project documentation.  To read more about how to tweak these layouts, see the section on template inheritance. ({{block.super}} is your friend!). </p>

<p> Voila! (Enjoy)  </p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, think there should be more layouts, or just want to talk story, feel free to contact us!</p>

<br/>            actual_device_root=True)Devices families definitionOne definition of family is a set of capabilities that aims to provide designated fine-grained control over the identification devices. In order to define new families, a file extra_families.py can be created in the project root. The device definition uses PyWURFL QueryLanguage (setting  QUERY_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT   to  True  in settings.py) or native Python (over Device object) syntax. </p>

<p>from djangobile import families</p>

<p>@families.add

<p>Prefix of loader tagsDjangobile provides two loader tags which are automatically added in order to make easier to write templates: those are &quot;extends&quot; and &quot;include&quot; templatetags device aware. This settings allows to define the prefix for them. By default its value is &#39;device&#39;, being the templatetags &quot;device_extends&quot; and &quot;device_include&quot;. But if it&#39;s  None , the native templatetags will be overwritten with those where suitable. </p>

<p># Prefix for &quot;extends&quot; and &quot;includes&quot; templatetags device aware.
<br/># If None, the native templatetags will be overwritten with
<br/># those where suitable.

 title : The djangotaskscheduler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DjangoTaskSchedulerThis Django project provides an extension to the excellent Django Admin interface from which a system administrator can start and manage scheduled tasks. </p>

<p>Tasks are defined as Python programs that can utilize the Django models for the main application. The tasks need to interact with the task scheduler to report its status and request file locations for its output files. Example task programs are provided with the source code. </p>

<p>Non python programs can be kicked of from a python wrapper that follows the task scheduler conventions.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The codeThe code that you can obtain through the source tab contains a full Django application. The application consists of two Django apps: </p>

<p>demo scheduler </p>

<p>the demo app is empty and does nothing.  After installing and starting the webserver, pointing your webbrowser to http://localhost:8000 will not show anything. This starts the demo app which is empty. </p>

<p>The scheduler has another url: point the browser to http://localhost:8000/scheduler and you end up in the main scheduler page. From here you can schedule a new task, refresh the page or go into details on the scheduled or completed tasks.  </p>

<p>Each task can have one of many statuses (queued, processing, completed or failed). As each task is run the status is shown in the main scheduler page. Each task can provide custom status messages (in example a progress message) that shows on the main page.  </p>

<p>Each task can create output files. These are created and kept in a predefined place. If you spend some extra time setting up a secure webserver, an administrator can download the outputfiles right from the task details page.  </p>

<p>A poller program is provided that  </p>

<p>The statusThe status of this project is that it is under development. The main functionality is available in the current code. However, some additional code has to be completed. SOme outstanding tasks on the todo list are: </p>

<p>Include security for the scheduler. Typically normal visitors to the website have no reason to view/manage the scheduler.   Include instructions for setting up a file server to serve the output files in a secure manor. Include a more robust way of tracking whether the task program is still running or failed.

<p>Use this package to allow full-text search in your Django project. </p>

<p>Versions compatibility matrix: </p>

<p>Djapian  Django  Xapian and python bindings  = 2.31.11.0.7 </p>

<p>Notice: there is an old issue with Xapian (&lt; 1.0.13) in mod_python environment. So be careful. </p>

<p>Notice: with 2.2.2 release has been introduced database schema backward-incompatible bug fix - Change model has switched its object_id field type from integer to string. </p>

<p>FeaturesMost of this features provided by Xapian itself and Djapian in this case plays role only as Django-compatible adaptation. </p>

<p>High-level DSL for indexer declaration Result filtering with Django ORM like API Result set compatible with standard Django Paginator Indexing of field, method results and related model attributes Entry filtering before indexing (by trigger function) Results filtering with boolean lookups support Term tagging Spelling corrections Stemming Result ordering by fields Indexers auto discovery Index shell Model changes auto tracking Support for different index spaces Usage exampleAssume that we have this models in our imaginary application: </p>

<p>class Person(models.Model):
<br/>    name = models.CharField(max_length=150)</p>

<p>    def __unicode__(self):
<br/>        return self.name</p>

<p>    def headline(self):
<br/>        return &quot;%s - %s&quot; % (self.author, self.title)</p>

<p>    def __unicode__(self):
<br/>        return self.titleAnd we want to apply indexing functionality for model Entry. The next step is to create Indexer instance with proper settings. Indexer may look like this: </p>

<p>import djapian</p>

<p>class EntryIndexer(djapian.Indexer):
<br/>    fields=[&quot;text&quot;]
<br/>    tags=[
<br/>        (&quot;author&quot;,  &quot;author.name&quot; ),

<br/>        (&quot;date&quot;,    &quot;created_on&quot;  ),
<br/>        (&quot;active&quot;,  &quot;is_active&quot;   ),
<br/>        (&quot;editors&quot;, &quot;editors&quot;     )
<br/>    ]
<br/>    trigger=lambda indexer, obj: obj.is_active</p>

<p>djapian.space.add_index(Entry, EntryIndexer, attach_as=&quot;indexer&quot;)In the django shell create some instances of models: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Person.objects.create(name=&quot;Alex&quot;)

<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Entry.objects.create(author=p, title=&quot;Third small entry&quot;, text=&quot;Some another text&quot;)</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Entry.indexer.update()Thats all! Each Entry instance has been indexed and now ready for search. Let&#39;s try: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; result = Entry.indexer.search(&#39;title:entry&#39;)

 title : The dmigrations Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>dmigrations - a simple migrations tool for DjangoCurrent version: 0.3.1 </p>

<p>dmigrations offers a simple but flexible way of managing changes to the database in your Django projects. It is a replacement for Django&#39;s built in syncdb command. </p>

<p>With dmigrations, every change to your database (including the creation of your initial tables) is bundled up in a migration. Migrations are Python files that live in a migrations directory. They can be applied and un-applied (reverted) in sequence. </p>

<p>The dmigrations app provides two sets of management commands: </p>

<p>./manage.py dmigrate </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Commands for listing, applying and un-applying migrations to your database. 
<br/>./manage.py dmigration </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Add a new migration to your migrations directory, ready to be executed using ./manage.py dmigrate 
<br/>For a full introduction, see the dmigrations tutorial. Read understanding migrations for more details on how migrations work and how they are managed. Check out dmigrations settings for information on additional settings. </p>

<p>dmigrations was presented at DjangoCon as part of the Schema Evolution panel. You can watch the video of the session, which includes a demo of dmigrations in action, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSq8m00p1FM </p>

<p>Limitationsdmigrations requires Django 1.0 - it will not work with versions prior to the database creation refactoring in 8296 dmigrations currently only works with MySQL. It uses InnoDB tables by default, but can be configured to use MyISAM using the DMIGRATIONS_MYSQL_ENGINE setting dmigrations uses decorators, so requires Python 2.4 or later. Django&#39;s default test framework will still use syncdb, so it won&#39;t run your tests using your migrations to create the tables. A major refactoring took place to prepare the code for release. If you find any bugs, please report them in the bug tracker. It should go without saying, but it&#39;s an extremely good idea to back up your production database before running any migrations against it. dmigrations was written by Simon Willison and Tomasz Wegrzanowski.

 title : The docbkx-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Docbkx Tools(Latest version: 2.0.10) </p>

<p> </p>

<p>What is it?The Docbkx Tools project provides a number of tools supporting DocBook in a Maven environment. This may seem odd to you, since 1) Maven 2 is supposed to support DocBook natively, relying on Doxia, and 2) there is already another DocBook plugin at mojo.codehaus.org. </p>

<p>The thruth however is that DocBook support in Doxia is fairly limited, mainly because Doxia as a framework supports only a small fraction of the concepts found in DocBook. The subset of DocBook supported by Doxia is not even close to simplified DocBook. </p>

<p>The DocBook plugin at mojo.codehaus.org is supporting a wider range of DocBook markup, and is in fact more similar to the DocBook tools provided with this project. There are however some significant differences. </p>

<p>Differences with other Maven pluginsThe focus is on ease of use. You should not be required to install additional stuff to your hard disk in order to generate content from your DocBook sources. Simply adding a reference to the plugin in your POM should be sufficient. This project focuses on providing dedicated support for particular DocBook XSL stylesheet distributions. That means you can rely on the dedicated parameterization mechanism of Maven Plugins to pass in the XSLT parameters defined for a particular version and type of XSLT stylesheet. In the DocBook Plugin found at mojo.codehaus.org, you will be required to download a specific version of the DocBook XSL stylesheets manually. The plugins packaged contain the stylesheets as well. (In this project, a particular version of the stylesheets is closely tied to a particular version of the plugin. That you means you can always rely on the plugin&#39;s documentation to know which parameters you could pass in.) The DocBook plugin found at mojo.codehaus.org requires you to have access to the Internet in order allow the plugin to resolve URI&#39;s. The plugins provided in this project act differently: if your DocBook sources are referening to a DTD, then you can simply add a dependency to a jar file containing the DTD and related entities, and the plugin will make sure that all references will be resolved correctly. How does this compare the DocBook Tools at SourceForge?This project builds on these tools; the main purpose is to provide something that integrates easily with Maven based builds. </p>

 summary : <p>What is dojangoDojango is a reusable django application that helps you to use the client-side framework dojo within your django project.   </p>

<p>It provides capabilites to easily switch between several dojo versions and sources (e.g. aol, google, local)  Delivers helping utilities, that makes the development of rich internet applications in combination with dojo more comfortable.  It makes the building of your own packed dojo release easier.  </p>

<p>Another goal of this project is, that you can learn how you have to structure your html to use dojo within your projects. </p>

<p>Dojango 0.3.0 is just running with Django versions &gt;= 1.0. </p>

<p>Dojango 0.3.1 is compatible with Django &gt;= 0.96. This is because dojango is now able to run on Google AppEngine and that platform uses Django 0.96. UPDATE: Not needed anymore, because AppEngine now supports Django 1.0 </p>

<p>Dojango 0.4: the FormIntegration just works with Django &gt;= 1.0.2 </p>

<p>Dojango 0.4.6: Dojo/Django ModelStore (Thanks to Ben Wilber, Documentation: http://sites.google.com/site/djangomodelstore/), easy dojo media file handling (dojo-media) and several bug fixes. Also available within PyPI (&quot;easy_install dojango&quot;). </p>

 summary : <p>This plugin let you use stub images instead of real Google AdSense ads while running web project in development mode. </p>

<p>InstallationTo checkout the latest version of the plugin to your Rails project run the following command in the root directory of the project: </p>

<p>$ svn co http://doodle-ad-stub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ vendor/plugins/doodle-ad-stubor if you use piston then run </p>

<p>$ piston import http://doodle-ad-stub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ vendor/plugins/doodle-ad-stubOpen terminal and run following command in the root directory of the plugin (vendor/plugins/doodle_ad_stub) </p>

<p>$ ruby ./install.rbThis will create google_adsense/ subdirectory in public/images/ directory of your project, and copy sample images of most available Google AdSense ad formats there. </p>

<p>Configuration file ppds_doodle_ad_stub.rb will be placed to config/initializers/ directory of your project, don&#39;t forget to review it and correct settings. </p>

<p>Ppds::DoogleAdStub.client_id = &quot;pub-0557047985484196&quot;

 summary : <p>Dope - A portable C implementation of a HashHash / Linked ListsAlmost everything I write requires some form of linked list, or more flexible array than C provides, perhaps because I&#39;m too used to using PHP or HashMaps in Java, or perhaps it&#39;s the same for everyone. It&#39;s such a small amount of code that you write it over and over without thinking about it. Dope can change that, while it&#39;s only a little bit of code it&#39;s incredibly useful, save yourself those 30 minutes every time you start a new project and go with a Hash that works and is thoroughly tested for leeks.</p>

 summary : <p>Robsworking branch merged to trunk, and robsworking and ilife branches deprecatedFor any users currently using trunk, you will receive a large update the next time you sync. We suggest that you back up your current install before trying the &quot;new&quot; trunk.  If you are currently using the robsworking branch, you will need to switch to trunk to get any future updates. </p>

<p>Snow Leopard SupportThere is preliminary support for Snow Leopard in the iLife branch. If you are using Snow Leopard please give it a try. If you have any issues with it, please post them here </p>

<p>Project Name Change !!!!At the request of Apple, we will be changing the name of our project. We have decided on  dotMobile.us Please bookmark that URL. We will be transitioning to a new project space and that URL will follow us where ever we go.   </p>

<p>What if...?you don’t think a few lousy gig’s of disk space on .Mac is enough you think .Mac is a bit slow you’d like backup.app to work without paying an annual fee   </p>

<p>Well... build your own dotMac  The following features should be expected to work on both 10.4 and 10.5: </p>

<p>Data synchronization for any application that supports .Mac (iCal, Address Book, notes, etc...) Note: Data synchronization between 10.4 and 10.5 isn&#39;t  (and probably won&#39;t be) implemented 
<br/>iDisk iDisk sync Note: If you are using multiple clients, please stick to either using idisk sync on all, or just straight idisk on all. This will be fixed in the second release 
<br/>Backup Please give the code a try, and let us know if you run into any problems here </p>

<p>Security issue foundPlease go here for detais http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/detail?id=44 </p>

<p>Tools that we use and recommendThere are two very important pieces of software that we use to help decode the protocols for use in dotMobile.us. Without them, we probably would have given up long ago. They are: DAV Explorer - Open Source Java Application Charles Web Proxy - Shareware application that the author graciously donated to us for use with this project. Anyone that has to do any HTTP/HTTPS programming or debugging should pick up a copy of this. </p>

<p>the iLife branchnot for the fainted heartedWe&#39;re trying to push the iLife branch towards stable. We&#39;re looking for people willing to install from the iLife branch;  basic features like in trunk will still work - others might update regularly over time. iLife introduced a .db user backend which&#39;ll break your current setup;  We&#39;ve set up a special issue page on iLife here We need people both documenting and reporting errors.</p>
 title : The dotnet-membership-provider Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project takes the C# port of janrain&#39;s OpenID library, maintained here: </p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid/ http://groups.google.com/group/dotnetopenid/ and wraps it in a developer-friendly ASP.NET membership provider, allowing as close to an out-of-the-box developer experience as possible. </p>

<p>As an ASP.NET developer, you can plug in OpenID to your application and use it as you use any other standard authentication plug-in. The starter kit gives you a quick-start sample to show how it all works. </p>

<p>Our goals for this project are to make OpenID for .NET developers: </p>

<p>Simple to use: Make OpenID simple for developers to plug in to any ASP.NET project Familiar: Leverage the Membership Provider infrastructure in ASP.NET </p>

<p>RELEASE NOTES(12/10/2007) The current .vsi file &#39;OpenID Membership Provider Starter kit for Visual Studio 2005 Beta 0.4&#39; corrects &quot;No Session State Found&quot; error after login. This build corrects all known issues to date.  </p>

<p>(12/09/2007) &#39;OpenID Membership Provider Starter kit for Visual Studio 2005 Beta 0.3&#39; protects password data for OpenID users by creating unusable passwords and salts for users having OpenID logins (OpenID users are authenticated via their Identity Provider and therefore have no need for local passwords). This will allow applications to use the same Membership database for one application that uses both OpenID and Forms authentication. </p>

<p>(12/03/2007) &#39;OpenID Membership Provider Starter kit for Visual Studio 2005 Beta 0.2&#39; corrects the janrain.openid.dll incompatibility error that was found in the first release. </p>

<p>About The OpenID Membership ProviderUsing the ASP.NET Membership Provider model, the OpenID Membership Provider allows you to leverage declarative authorization and other ASP.NET providers (such as Roles Providers) with OpenID authentication. </p>

<p>To learn more about OpenID, visit OpenID.net. OpenID authentication is made possible through third party Identity Providers. This Starter Kit assumes your users will make use of existing OpenID Identity Providers (IDPs).</p>

 title : The doubler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Doubler is a code generator (C# and VB.NET) that makes unit testing easier. It is especially useful when working with legacy code. It is a Reflector add-in, a tool already woven into your workflow. It will help you cleave dependencies apart, create test doubles, and write unit tests with little effort and less coding. </p>

<p>Some of the features are: </p>

<p>Recording Generator – Use against an abstract type. It will create a Recording Test Stub. Recorders generated have the following features for each method on the subject type: o Property named Called of type Boolean that records if the method was called. 
<br/>o Properties for each parameter passed named in the following format Passed of the same type as the parameter. 
<br/>o Property named ReturnValue of the same type as return type of the subject method. If subject method is void this property is not created. When the method is called the this value is returned. 
<br/>o Property named ExceptionToThrow of type Exception. When the method is called if this property is not null the property value is thrown. 
<br/>Wrapper/Interface Generator – Use against a concrete type. It will create a mirror interface of the subject type and an implementation of the interface that passes all calls to a private instance of the subject type. This can be used to help control dependencies, allowing unit tests to insert a test double in place of the subject (run the Recording Generator on the mirror interface). Fake Generator - Use against an abstract type. It will create a Fake Object. Test Generator – Use against a concrete type. It will generate a unit test fixture and test methods for each public method on the test subject. The test methods will contain a start on the unit test.</p>

 title : The drarch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewArchitecture Reconstruction is a process in which the &quot;as-built&quot; architecture of an implemented system is obtained from an existing system. This is done through a detailed analysis of the system using tool support. The tool (DRArch) extract information about the system and aid in building and aggregating successive levels of abstraction. The end result is an architectural representation. </p>

<p>The result of architectural reconstruction can be used in several ways. If no documentation exists or if it is out of date, the recovered architectural representation can be used as a basis for re-documenting the architecture. The results of a reconstruction can also be used  to recover the as built architecture to check conformance against an &quot;as-designed&quot; architecture. This assures us that the developers have followed the architectural edicts. The reconstruction can also be used as the basis for analyzing the architecture or as a starting point for re-engineering the system to a new desired architecture. Finally, the representation can be used to identify elements for re-use or to establish an architecture-based software product line. </p>

<p>DRArch define a process of Software Architecture Reconstruction. Consists of a collection of tools that can be used to extract information from an implemented system, build abstractions of that information, through the use of a query language and generate architecture views of that information.  </p>

<p>The following diagram show the main concept of DRArch:</p>

 title : The dsolve Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project seeks to firstly provide the most user friendly way for those with diabetes to track key information.  This information includes intraday blood sugars, meals (with their nutrional values), doctor visits, lab results (like A1c), and much more.  Lastly, since many meters on the market now allow you to save your blood sugar results to a file via a computer interface this application will also allow a user to upload files from various meters.</p>

<p>The second core feature will be that of both simple and complex data analysis for the individual user of their own diabetes information via datawarehousing techniques as well as visually through charts and graphs.</p>

<p>The last feature of this application will be for medical community researchers.  It is our hope that with enough specific information about those with diabetes, their nutrition, and lab results we will have built a solid basis for the medical community to conduct innumerable studies all in a manner that provides only the basic personnel information such as age, sex, and years with diabetes.  In this way both the individual diabetic is benefited from this very useful application but the diabetic community is also benefited from entering as much data as possible and created this research information library for analysis today and into the future.</p>

 summary : <p>For my master thesis research on duck migration I created a set of scripts to process and visualize the data. Ducks are captured, given a ring and then released. Days or years later the duck is found again and reported. Information such as age, cause of death, geographical location is added.  </p>

<p>Note: I moved the source code to Github, but other information will remain here. </p>

<p>Many countries keep a database with many different bird species that were ringed in their country. My research focussed on ducks ringed in the Netherlands. Because the data is stored according to the international EURING standard, this software can - with some modifications - in principle be used for all bird species in all countries that use the EURING standard or something similar. </p>

<p>The original EURING data is imported from a fixed-width text format into a MySQL database. Several Ruby on Rails migrations (some executing other SQL &amp; PHP scripts) convert this data into a relational database, perform consistency checks and mix it with some other data. Finally, the Rails program visualizes the data.  </p>

<p>I deviate from the EURING standard in several ways which I believe are necessary. For example I strictly adhere to the ISO 3166 standard of country (subdivision) codes (using e.g. geonames.org for the conversion) and use decimal coordinates of latitude and longitude.  </p>

<p>More information is available on the Wiki. You can download the source code and visit a demonstration website. The data is not (always) freely available, but there is a small example dataset and I will provide information on how to obtain more. The wiki also provides several MySQL queries that I used for my research. </p>

<p>After I graduate I may not have a lot of time for further development, but I will be available to answer questions and suggest ideas.</p>

 title : The dunitlite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DUnitLite is an attempt to improve upon the DUnit unit-testing framework for Delphi. It&#39;s currently an add-on library for DUnit (though, as the name suggests, it may someday grow to be a full lightweight testing library in its own right). </p>

<p>Right now, DUnitLite offers three major features over the base DUnit library: </p>

<p>Readable assertionsMost xUnit test frameworks have backwards assertion methods. They make you put the expected value first, followed by the actual value: </p>

<p>CheckEquals(4, Add(2, 2));How do you read that? &quot;Check that 4 is what you get when you add 2 and 2&quot;? You shouldn&#39;t have to think this hard to understand what the test is doing. What if you could write it the way you would speak: &quot;Check that 2 plus 2 is 4&quot;? </p>

<p>Enter DUnitLite. </p>

<p>Specify.That(Add(2, 2), Should.Equal(4));
<br/>Specify.That(Control.Caption, Should.Equal(&#39;Close&#39;).IgnoringCase);
<br/>Specify.That(ElapsedTime, Should.Be.AtMost(500));See SupportedSyntax for a list of all the different things you can do. </p>

<p>More data typesDUnit&#39;s CheckEquals() methods support a limited number of data types. The only way you can compare two enums (or two records, or...) is to write your own CheckEquals overload -- which isn&#39;t that hard, but then you need to write more code if you want CheckNotEquals, CheckGreater, CheckGreaterOrEqual... </p>

<p>DUnitLite has built-in support for data types DUnit doesn&#39;t (e.g. TPoint). And when you want to add more, you only have to write the code once to get the benefit everywhere. </p>

<p>See SupportedTypes for more details. </p>

<p>String contextWhen comparing really long strings, it can be hard to see where they&#39;re actually different. DUnitLite makes it easier by showing only a portion of the strings, centered around the first character that&#39;s actually different. </p>

<p>Specify.That(Query.Sql.Text, Should.Equal(ExpectedSql));</p>

<p>Expected: ...&#39;.TicketID = Tickets.ID&#39;#13#10&#39;WHERE Component = 42 AND Status = 1 A&#39;...
<br/> but was: ...&#39;.TicketID = Tickets.ID&#39;#13#10&#39;WHERE Tickets.Component = 42 AND Tick&#39;...</p>

 title : The dwarvis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is meant as a collection of 3rd party utilities for the game Dwarf Fortress. It concentrates on utilities that have the purpose of providing a 3-dimensual visualization of the ingame world. It contains two applications at the current time. </p>

<p>ApplicationsLifevisThis is the main program, a life viewer of a DF game. It shows a 3d representation centered on the current view, which constantly updates. It currently displays landscape, creatures, buildings and items, although the latter three aren&#39;t yet at full detail representation. Additionally it forwards all input to DF, so it can act as a remote control. </p>

<p>Please click the Feedback link to the right if you have questions about lifevis, want to make suggestions or provide general feedback. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>map_extractThis script accesses the memory of a running (and hopefully paused) Dwarf Fortress game. It extracts the landscape data and exports the tile types and other parts into a gzipped text file. More... </p>

<p>Latest Updates(Changes are listed chronologically from the bottom up.) </p>

<p>Lifevis v0.254 - Date: 03:05:45, Freitag, 14. November 2008 </p>

<p>All items are now stored in a hash again, due to unpredictably high id values exceeding the memory bounds when applied to an array. Removed &quot;item_present&quot; array in favor of visible flag on items, need to think about how to handle items vanishing from DF&#39;s memory list IF it happens. All update loops and the render loop now set times at which they wish to be run again; these times are calculated by adding the configurable delay to the current time and subtracting the time it took for the loop to run the last time. All update loops now run for a minimum configurable time slice before returning control to the dispatcher. All update loops and the render loop now have functions for time measuring. Item data is grabbed in buckets with each one spanning multiple item data sets. Unit data is now grabbed as one string and dissected in Perl. Speed-up of landscape updates when cell didn&#39;t change by comparing data extract in one step before cycling through the tiles in the cell. Lifevis v0.249 - Date: 13:33:29, Dienstag, 11. November 2008 This effectively improves performance by skipping invisible cells. Model drawing is now split into 1. drawing of landscape, 2. drawing of visibility masks and selecting cells based on visibility level, 3. drawing buildings, items, creatures in selected cells.  Landscape display list generation now generates crude visibility mask display lists.  Base lighting made brighter.  Lighting variances still not optimal.  Added glDeleteQueries call to OpenGL module. Notes about OpenGL module changes added to documents. All models are now drawn by z-layer in preparation for occlusion checks. Creature, building and item lists in cell structure are now divided by z-layer.  Display list storage in caches changed to enable easier access and extension.  Documents and internals files updated to correspond with that.  Calculation of light variances changed.  Recompiled OpenGL module to include occlusion check calls. Added QuadTree class to deal with creating occlusion check shapes. Implemented zoom-by-fov in order to reduce z-clipping. (inactive) Reduced z-buffer accuracy problems by clamping clipping planes to outer bounds of map. Made landscape display lists be drawn in one call. Fixed warning from threads when loading OpenGL twice by loading secondary modules later on.  Reactivated culling of invisible faces. ModelGen now generates vertex array draw commands. Adapted buildings, creatures, items to new generic method and phased out old specific methods. Made model generation sub routines return display list ids.  Building drawing adapted to general model display lists. Landscape drawing sketchily adapted to new parts subroutines.  General model-&gt;display list conversion routine created.  Model code generation switched to generating separate subroutines for faces in the cardinal directions and one for the main body.  Basis for parts-based display list generation laid. Made the model generator code decidedly less retarded and easier to transition over to generate individual subroutines for the normals. Added comments to model generator code. Refactoring to prepare for switch to vertex arrays.  Improved handling of z-based lighting of buildings. Added dedicated default building model.  Lifevis v0.227 - Date: 16:00:09, Samstag, 18. Oktober 2008 Input sent to DF is now immediate and doesn&#39;t follow Windows&#39; repeat rules anymore. Improved mouse interaction. New cursor model. Fixed Stairs-Down model to simply be a hole in the floor. Added vtable export converter. Made update loops for buildings and items assign vtable names and offsets to items. Added basic models for doors and workshops. Added basic building model distinction system. Made range change buttons dim when range limits reached. Made view range changes also change the clipping range to reduce z-fighting. A lot of code refactoring. Lifevis v0.215 - Date: 20:29:24, Dienstag, 14. Oktober 2008 Bugfix to make the view update when the drawing range is changed even then the cursor isn&#39;t moved. Far clipping plane moved closer to reduce z-errors. All Perl modules updated to most current versions, especially OpenGL, which is now at 0.57 and includes freeglut. Lifevis v0.213 - Date: 16:38:01, Dienstag, 14. Oktober 2008 New self-compiled executables. Items that are in bins now get ignored. Interface cleaned up a bit. Item data now stored in array and indexed by DF-internal item id, instead of in a hash indexed by memory address. Items are now only stored when they are lying on the ground and not hidden. Lifevis v0.209 Mostly performance improvements, as follows: Memory loop now sleeps until needed. Memory loop becomes less aggressive when all current cells are protected. Idle tasks routine converted to &quot;while&quot;-loop with a central loop scheduler to cut number of routine calls. Added higher priority for drawing-loop, tweaked fps limiter to be more exact. Unnecessary cloning of arrays converted to much faster iteration over them. Lifevis v0.204 Added display of item placeholders. Tweaked settings to speed graphics up a bit. Added export of data of items/buildings/creatures in current square. Fixed bug in rendering loop that prevented buildings from rendering in cells without creatures. Lifevis v0.200 - Date: 10:25:14, Mittwoch, 8. Oktober 2008 Buildings now get displayed as bright red blocks. Doesn&#39;t work 100% yet. Added readme file. Reduced creature update slowdown to 0. Made some small optimizations to creature updates. Lifevis v0.198 - Date: 01:12:00, Mittwoch, 8. Oktober 2008 Calls to Win32::Process::Memory converted to direct calls, resulting in a speed-up of the update routines of roughly 200%.</p>

<p>As an alternative, try placing this in application.rb: </p>

<p>  helper_method :read_fragment_or_cache
<br/>  def read_fragment_or_cache(opts)
<br/>    #puts &quot;read_fragment_or_cahce called. opts = #{opts.inspect}&quot;
<br/>    # Check to see if key has expired
<br/>    return nil unless opts[:key]
<br/>    key = opts[:key]
<br/>    expire_at = opts[:expire_at] || Time.now
<br/>    fragment = Rails.cache.read(key, :raw =&gt; true)
<br/>    #fragment = read_fragment(key, {:expire_at =&gt; expire_at})
<br/>    if fragment.nil?
<br/>      puts &quot;\n\n Fragment NOT FOUND for key:  #{key}\n&quot;
<br/>      # Render whatever should be rendered by the render options to a string for caching.
<br/>      fragment = render_to_string(opts[:render])
<br/>      Rails.cache.write(key, fragment, :raw =&gt; true)
<br/>      #result = write_fragment(opts[:key], fragment)
<br/>    else
<br/>      puts &quot;\n\n Fragment WAS INDEED found for key: #{key}\n&quot;
<br/>    end
<br/>    return fragment
<br/>  endThen you can define cache helper methods (in application.rb, for example) like: </p>

<p>  helper_method :cached_popular_this_week
<br/>  def cached_popular_this_week
<br/>    fragment = read_fragment_or_cache :key =&gt; &quot;home/popular_this_week&quot;,
<br/>                                      :expire_at =&gt; 1.hour.ago,
<br/>                                      :render =&gt; {:partial =&gt; &quot;shared/popular_this_week&quot;}
<br/>    return fragment
<br/>  endAnd simply call them in your views with: </p>

<p>&lt;%= cached_popular_this_week %&gt;
<br/>There might be better ways to do all this.  Hopefully this is of some help though if you are migrating to Rails 2.1 and beyond.</p>

 title : The easycache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Easycache lets you easily cache arbitrary data in your Ruby on Rails applications. The plugin makes use of Rails&#39; built-in fragment caching mechanism to store and retrieve any serializable data. This is especially useful when you want to store data from slow/external sources like LDAP, Web Services, or REXML functions, for which Rails does not currently offer an integrated caching mechanism. </p>

<p>INSTALLATIONFrom the command line, cd into your Rails application&#39;s root directory and run: </p>

<p>ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/zuk/rails-easycache.git </p>

<p>EXAMPLESOnce you&#39;ve installed the plugin, you should be able to do something like this anywhere in your application (in controllers, helpers, etc.): </p>

<p>foo = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;beta&#39;, &#39;delta&#39;, &#39;gamma&#39;]</p>

<p># store foo in the cache under the keyname &#39;greek&#39;
<br/>Easycache.write(&#39;greek&#39;, foo)</p>

<p># retrieve the data stored under keyname &#39;greek&#39;
<br/>foo = Easycache.read(&#39;greek&#39;)</p>

<p># delete the data stored under keyname &#39;greek&#39;
<br/>Easycache.delete(&#39;greek&#39;)In practice, you will probably want to use caching transparently, so that data is pulled from the cache if available, or from the original source otherwise. For example, say you have a function ldap_query() that does a slow LDAP query to retrieve some data. Just wrap this function call inside an Easycache.cache block, like this: </p>

<p>my_data = Easycache.cache(&#39;ldap_data&#39;) do
<br/>  ldap_query()
<br/>endThe first time the block runs, it will execute ldap_query(), store its return value in the cache under the key &#39;ldap_data&#39;, and return it for assignment into your my_data variable. The next time it&#39;s run, the return value will come from the cache, so the block won&#39;t need to be executed. </p>

<p>TIME-BASED EXPIRYThe write() and cache() methods both take an optional options hash. Currently the only supported option is :expiry, which will force the cached value to expire after the given number of seconds. For example: </p>

<p>Easycache.write(&#39;greek&#39;, [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;beta&#39;], :expiry =&gt; 60)or </p>

<p>greek = Easycache.cache(&#39;greek&#39;, :expiry =&gt; 60) do
<br/>  [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;beta&#39;]
<br/>endThe above will expire the &#39;greek&#39; value after 60 seconds. In Rails applications you can use active_support&#39;s time extensions to specify the expiry period. For example: </p>

<p>Easycache.write(&#39;greek&#39;, [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;beta&#39;], :expiry =&gt; 24.hours)</p>

 summary : <p>The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications database: A centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data. </p>

<p>Index | How to Obtain, Build and Configure a Local PRIDE Web Application: Prerequisites -&gt; </p>

<p>IntroductionThe PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data. It has been developed to provide the proteomics community with a public repository for protein and peptide identifications together with the evidence supporting these identifications. PRIDE has been developed through a collaboration of the EMBL-EBI and Ghent University in Belgium. The original motivation behind its development was to provide a common data exchange format and repository to support proteomics literature publications. This remit has grown with PRIDE, with the hope that PRIDE will provide a reference set of tissue-based identifications for use by the community. The future development of PRIDE has become closely linked to HUPO PSI. In addition to identifications, PRIDE is able to capture details of post-translational modifications coordinated relative to the peptides in which they have been found.

 title : The ecataloger Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The eCataloger application provides cataloging utilities to create an eLibrary for an individual or small organization. </p>

<p>An eLibrary is a collection of electronic records used to organize and manage born digital resources (websites, ebooks, mp3) and as a meta-data proxy for books, magazines, physical video and audio, and other physical objects. The 1.1 release of the eCataloger, currently in an development beta, uses the FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) framework to model the records using data elements and concepts from the MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema), MARC, and other current and developing cataloging and metadata standards. By using FRBR as the descriptive framework, an overarching goal of the eCataloger is realized by being able to produce valid and well-formed MODS and MARC xml documents for interchange with existing and legacy library electronic systems. Because of the richness of the underlying FRBR data model, the eCataloger can be valid component in a larger semantic web ecology.</p>

 title : The echo-nest-remix Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Echo Nest Remix API is the Internet Synthesizer that lets you make things with music and video. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve done the following: rearranged the syllables of a vocal line, walkenized and cowbellized hundreds of thousands of songs in a week, mixed up the hits of a drum beat and synced it to another loop, beat matched two songs, split apart DJ mixes by their individual tracks, made new kinds of video mashups, corrected sloppy drumming,  synced a video to a song, transitioned between two covers of the same song, made a cat play piano, put a donk on it. </p>

<p>We&#39;re making this available as an open source SDK for Python (other languages forthcoming!) that can be easily installed for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. It accesses the Echo Nest Analyze API at http://developer.echonest.com via the pyechonest wrapper and plays with the results to make new concoctions of audio and video. You&#39;ll need an Echo Nest API key to use this SDK, instructions are found on the following install pages. </p>

<p>What to doStep 1: Download the native installer for your platform</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>    OS X 10.5 or  OS X 10.6</p>

<p>  Windows</p>

<p>(Please first read WindowsInstallNotes.)</p>

<p>  Linux / Source</p>

<p>   </p>

<p>Step 2: Set up your Echo Nest API KeyYou need an API key from The Developer Nest to use Remix. Get your key and set it up on your computer or in your code.  </p>

<p>Read this key install tutorial for Windows, Mac or Linux. </p>

<p>For the experts in the room, just set the environment variable you need.  </p>

<p>export ECHO_NEST_API_KEY=&quot;the key you got from the Echo Nest Developer Site&quot;Step 3: Make something beautifulPlay with the many community contributed examples that make awesome things with audio and video. The installers put them on your computer along with some sample audio.  </p>

<p>On Windows they are in your Python folder (probably C:\Python26\echo-nest-remix-examples\.) </p>

<p>On the Mac they are in /usr/local/share/echo-nest-remix-examples. </p>

<p>cd one
<br/>python one.py ../music/CryMeARiver.mp3 output.mp3output.mp3 will sound like Cry Me A River, but only the first beat of every measure. </p>

<p>You should now start writing your own remix programs! </p>

<p>Join the discussion list for questions and comments.  </p>

<p>Read Adam Lindsay&#39;s excellent tutorial. </p>

<p>Bookmark the API Documentation. </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Reverse a song by playing its beats forward starting from the end of the song&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br/>import echonest.audio as audio</p>

<p># Easy wrapper around mp3 decoding and Echo Nest analysis
<br/>audio_file = audio.LocalAudioFile(&quot;NeverGonnaTellIt.mp3&quot;)</p>

<p># You can manipulate the beats in a song as a native python list
<br/>beats = audio_file.analysis.beats
<br/>beats.reverse()</p>

<p># And render the list as a new audio file!
<br/>audio.getpieces(audio_file, beats).encode(&quot;NeverGonnaTellItBackwardsByBeat.mp3&quot;)Which creates something like this: NeverGonnaTellItBackwardsByBeat.mp3 </p>

 title : The ecko Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>{{Infobox bot | screenshot = [[Image:EckoSplash.jpg|250px]] | name = Ecko | developer = {{deviant|AzimuthDragon}} | language = [Ruby] | development_state = 0.1 Alpha (Rewrite 1) | source_model = Open source | last_release_s = None | license = software] (General Public License|GPL]) }} </p>

<p>Ecko is a WIP bot written by {{deviant|AzimuthDragon}}. Ecko was written in Azimuth&#39;s spare time as a fun project to occupy him when bored, and to provide a challenge and the next step in working with the Ruby programming language. </p>

<p>Notice Due to the large volume of schoolwork I am attempting to balance with my full-time job, I cannot give anyone a specific date at which Ecko will be available to the private alpha testers. &#39;&#39;&#39;I am still looking for alpha testers, but please be patient if you do want to try Ecko, as it may be a while before there is a functional program to download and test.&#39;&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>DownloadsEcko is not currently publicly available, however, a private alpha will be available hopefully within the coming weeks. To join the alpha, please note {{deviant|AzimuthDragon}} via dAmn in #Botdom or the regular dA notes system and he will add you to the list. </p>

<p>TasksOverall Tasks Finish &amp; debug GUI  Write core functions (connection class, plugin system, etc.)  Connect to dAmn and work out further flaws in code. </p>

<p>Current Tasks Continue writing core classes in individual files. </p>

<p>To Do Write core classes.  Reenable logging to file.  Write a class to log any errors to file, or prevent Ecko from exiting on error, instead disconnecting from dAmn and printing the error to the chat feed.  Enable users to change colors.  Enable dAmnColors-type logging in the chat feed.  Debug connection class.  Enable connection to my server for Update class.  Enable autoscrolling in the main log window.  Enable tabs for channels.  Create plugin system, and write an API for the user to create plugins with.  Write a debugger to run plugins through a dry run, disconnected from dAmn if the user wishes to enable it. </p>

<p> Take over the world. &#39;&#39;In Progress&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>Features GUI  Main Window:  Chat window (Tab for each channel Ecko is connected to)  Control bot functions (Start, Stop, Restart)  Options Window:  Enable/Disable program colors  Enable/Disable Welcome message  Enable/Disable Plugins  Manage User Lists  Enable/Disable Automatic Login  Enable/Disable Automatic Reconnect  Enable/Disable Logs  Select Log Path  Exclude specific channels  Settings Window:  Change Username/Password  Change Trigger  Change Owner  Specify Default Chatroom </p>

<p>ChangelogMay 2nd, 2008 Added a basic Updater class. </p>

<p>May 1st, 2008 Separated core classes into individual files.  Rewrote classes to load core files. </p>

<p>April 29th, 2008 Altered code to compare symbols instead of strings.   Started commenting on the code to enable RDoc documentation for classes, methods, and other functions.  Began writing code in separate files, according to class types. </p>

<p>April 23rd, 2008 Reformatted system and configuration variable storage, isolated into two variables. </p>

<p>April 17th, 2008 Added a Comparison class and reformatted the Save Options function to be compatible with the comparison class and new options window interface. </p>

<p>April 15th, 2008 Logging Class:  Enabled logging to a file, and the ability to enable/disable chat logging </p>

<p>April 14th, 2008 Dynamic saving class:  Changed output format slightly. </p>

<p> Options Dialogue:  Rearranged and reformatted controls. Grouped together controls according to what they do, ex, GUI change, or a System change.  Switched from buttons to radio selection buttons, and added the ability to select where to save log files if logging is on. </p>

<p>Credits {{deviant|ManjyomeThunder}} - Thanks for the time and patience in helping me learn Ruby, and for [Sapphire], which I used to learn even more of Ruby. </p>

<p>Disclaimer I, {{deviant|AzimuthDragon}}, am not responsible for anything that using this bot may cause on your computer.   Ecko has been developed and tested under Microsoft Windows XP, Service Pack 2, and I cannot guarantee that this program will run correctly on other operating systems. This includes, but is not limited to:  Mac OS X  Linux  Microsoft Windows Vista  I am also NOT responsible for improper use of this bot. If you cannot use the bot or set it up yourself, then you shouldn&#39;t be messing with it. I suggest you learn how to use, operate, and maintain a bot before you try to use Ecko or any other bot available for dAmn or other networks. If you can&#39;t figure out how to install Ruby or download Ecko, that is your problem. I will assist you IF you have honestly tried setting up the bot and failed no matter what you do. Of course, if you get an error, please inform me immediately. </p>

 title : The ecs235a-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewA project for ECS235a, a UC Davis graduate course in the Computer Science department.  Extends the work presented in Web-Based Inference Detection by addressing some of the weaknesses in that paper. </p>

<p>AbstractSensitive information is redacted from a document before the document is released to protect that information from being exposed. Existing research proposed a web-based inference detection system but suffered from three weaknesses:  </p>

<p>Leaking Information Performance Problems Limited Strategy for Redacting.   Our work shows that the weaknesses in the existing proposed system can be overcome without sacrificing the quality of the inference detection.  iDetect, our prototype inference detection system, leverages a large offline knowledge base for detection, a synonym system for recommending word replacements, and an entity extraction system for identifying entities to remove to defeat inferences. </p>

<p>TechnologiesiDetect uses a suite of Java and open source technologies to implement its functionality.  Brief descriptions of each technology and how they were utilized are provided below: </p>

<p>Technology  Utilization   Java API for XML Binding (JAXB).  JAXB provides object to xml mappings by compiling XSDs into objects and then marshalling/unmarshalling between XML and objects.  The Wikipedia data dumps are provided in XML format.  By using JAXB, we were able to convert the exported data into Java objects, which we then could manipulate and store in a database and/or search index.   Java Persistance API (JPA).  JPA provides a lightweight object relational mapping (ORM) scheme through the use of annotations.  Java objects are annotated with various descriptors that indicate how to map the fields into relational storage.  JPA also provides service classes to manage the persistence of objects, including handling transactional concerns.  Our data is mapped and retrieved from its object form into a database through JPA.   Spring is used as a lightweight inversion of control (IoC) container that does dependency injection, serving to wire together components in a declarative fashion.  Our subsystems and services are wired together using Spring, to facilitate loose coupling between the components.   Hibernate provides a robust ORM implementation and support for mapping objects into a search index.  Hibernate is our JPA provider, meaning that it implements the functionality to make JPA work in our system.  We also use the Hibernate Search offering to map the article full text into a search index.   Lucene is a Java-based full text search engine.  We used Lucene to be the full text search engine that we utilized to search for the “similar documents”.   LingPipe is a natural language processing toolkit that includes a named entity recognizer (NER) and a trained model, for that NER, built from news sources.  LingPipe is our named entity recognizer for Persons, Organizations, and Locations.   Java Server Faces (JSF) is a recent component based model for web design.  The entire web-based UI was developed using JSF components.   Jetty is a light-weight servlet container that makes it easy to start up a web application without requiring the user to install a servlet container like Tomcat.  We use Jetty to host the iDetect web application when it is running on a local host.</p>

 title : The eeedora Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThe Asus Eee 701 PC comes with a nice-and-easy UI, on top of a Xandros (debian-based) core.  </p>

<p>However, for &#39;power users&#39; familiar with RedHat distributions, it&#39;s far more comfortable to use a version of Fedora, customized for the Eee machine. </p>

<p>This project includes the files necessary to build a custom spin of Fedora (using their excellent tools), put it onto a CD (or USB key) as a Live version to test it out, and then install it as a replacement for the Asus default. </p>

<p>GoalsThis project&#39;s goal is to have a Live (and installable) distribution that : </p>

<p>Is Fedora (currently Fedora 8) Runs XFCE as a windowing environment Takes as little space on the Eee&#39;s Flash drive as possible Gives the user the option of installing bigger packages (like openoffice, media players, etc) Understands each piece of hardware on the Eee (wireless, webcam, speakers, etc) ... and generally gives everyone a sense of satisfaction. </p>

<p>DocumentationThere are a few more Wiki pages over at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:eeedora , and there&#39;s a downloadable ISO available at http://eeedora.complexvalues.com/ . </p>

<p>Project descriptionThis application is a webcam image processing library on top of OpenCV intended to generate events from user&#39;s head, hand and body movements. This library is also intended to track objects so that augmented reality can be made. In order to enhance human computer interaction, the application is going to use a single webcam, without the needs to use FTIR or Diffused Illumination techniques. Besides tracking positions, this library will also be able to provide higher level events and gestures like get 3d user position, and open hand gestures. Collision with virtual objects is also considered in augmented reality. </p>

<p>Features:2d/3d head tracking, hand/finger tracking, body tracking, gesture recognition, fiducial marks, motion velocity, augmented reality object tracking. </p>

<p>Aligned with Natural User Interface idea of benefiting artistic and educational applications, this library&#39;s use could range from helping people severely paralyzed or afflicted with diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) to revolutionary user interface paradigms. 3d head-tracking can create an environment so that Internet browser contents could be zoomed in and out as well as visualize 3d models from user perspective of view. Hand and finger tracking can be used in eye-toy like games as well as scrolling book pages or photos from distance, as when showing photos to friends or in Slideshow  presentations. Similar functionalities like Touchlib&#39;s could also be used. Augmented reality can bring a brand new revolutionary paradigm of user interface through an unexplored mix of virtual and real objects for never seen interaction mechanisms. Library demo applications like these should be included. An interesting trait of this library is that users won&#39;t need to wear any equipment! </p>

<p>Herramienta de utilidad para generar combinaciones que te ayuden a memorizar números de teléfono. </p>

<p>http://elbautizadordetelefonos.com/ http://open.movilforum.com/node/374 http://open.movilforum.com/node/375  Intenciones </p>

<p>El Bautizador de Teléfonos intenta ser una herramienta sencilla pero útil. editar Instrucciones </p>

<p>Inserta tu teléfono o el de un amigo, selecciona un diccionario y te mostraremos una selección de maneras de teclear ese mismo teléfono pero acordándote de letras y palabras en vez de números. </p>

<p>El teclado de cualquier teléfono comparte las teclas tanto para escribir números como para escribir letras. Cuando estamos escribiendo un número para marcarlo el teléfono sabe que lo que tiene que coger es el número de la tecla y no la letra. Pero eso no quita que en lo que tú te fijes sea la letra. </p>

<p>Por ejemplo: intentemos pulsar las teclas del teléfono para escribir &#39;abaco&#39; (atención: una pulsación por tecla, no varias como en los SMS). Si escribimos &#39;abaco&#39; vemos que el teléfono nos marca el: &#39;22226&#39;. </p>

<p>Y si intentamos escribir &#39;cachorros&#39; nos marca el &#39;222467767&#39;. </p>

<p>Esta aplicación hace la operación inversa. Dale un teléfono y veremos que cosas raras podemos escribir con esa combinación.  </p>

<p>El Bautizo </p>

<p>Al proceso de convertir el número de teléfono en una secuencia de caracteres y números lo llamamos &#39;El Bautizo&#39;. </p>

<p>Disclaimer </p>

<p>No hay que esperar que dé la casualidad de que tu teléfono tenga una combinación de letras chula rollo &#39;elreyguay&#39;, es bastante difícil, lo más normal es que aparezcan propuestas como &#39;aba5tio45&#39;. </p>

<p>APIs de Movistar </p>

<p>Si estás dado de alta en el servicio copiagenda (copiagenda) de Movistar España podrás descargar todos tus contactos y elegir uno de los teléfonos a bautizar. </p>

<p>Si estás dado de alta en el servicio interface HTTP de envío de SMS (Interfaz HTTP de envío de SMS) de Movistar España podrás enviar el número de teléfono bautizado a tu contacto vía SMS. </p>

 summary : <p>Es ist schon lange bekannt, dass alle derzeit verfügbaren digitalen Elberfelder Bibeltexte von 1871 fehlerhaft sind, weil sie in der Regel eine Textmischung der verschiedenen Ausgaben der Elberfelderbibel darstellen. Die Theologische Initiative Freiburg hat deshalb beschlossen, diesem unerfreulichen Zustand ein Ende zu bereiten. Wir haben eine Kopie der Original Ausgabe der Elberfelder 1871 vorliegen und wollen in einen gemeinsamen Projekt daraus ein textgetreues Zefania XML Bibelmodul erstellen. Damit die Arbeit möglichst rasch bewältigt werden kann, haben wir ein Revisionskontrollsystem(SVN)aufgesetzt, um die Arbeit gemeinsam im Team zu erledigen zu können.</p>

 title : The embeddedjavascript Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EJS cleans the HTML out of your JavaScript with client side templates. After EJS gets its rubber gloves on dirty code, you&#39;ll feel organized and uncluttered. </p>

<p>Home   Getting Started Guide  NBA Demo   How-to Screencast   </p>

<p>DescriptionEJS is essentially a port of Masatoshi Seki&#39;s erb.rb in the Ruby Core. It operates in the same way that PHP, ERB, or any of the other embedded language interpreters work, except where all existing preprocessing engines execute on the server-side, EJS is intended to run within the web browser. This allows client-side code to process JavaScript-based web templates for insertion into the current page without consulting the server. </p>

<p>EJS uses  or % as its magic tags.  Like most other frameworks of its type,  tags cause all code within them to be executed, and the addition of an equals sign () causes the enclosed code to be evaluated and the toString representation of the result appended to the document. </p>

<p>Typical UseEJS templates can be loaded within a page or a separate file.  Once the EJS template is loaded, it is passed data used to render template.  The result of the render is typically used to update HTML on the page. </p>

<p>ExampleWith this example, we will create and load a template that displays a list of cleaning supplies. </p>

<p>First, lets create a template file that iterates through a list of supplies: </p>

<p>Supplies</p>

<p>Next, we create an object to hold those supplies: </p>

<p>var my_supplies = {supplies: [&#39;mop&#39;, &#39;broom&#39;, &#39;duster&#39;]}Finally, we load the template, render it with the supply object, and update an HTML element with the results. </p>

<p>var result = new EJS({url: &#39;templates/supplies.ejs&#39;}).render(my_supplies);
<br/>document.getElementById(&#39;supply_list&#39;).innerHTML = resultView HelpersEJS includes view helpers to make building repetitive HTML snippets easier.  The view helpers are very similar to Ruby on Rails ActionView helpers. </p>

<p>ExampleThe following builds a form that adds cleaning supplies. </p>

<p>

<br/>Error HandlingUsing a special version of JSLint, EJS can provide nice error handling when you are developing your templates. By including ejs_fulljslint similar to  </p>

<p>To help the developper in optimizing and providing this information, it provide some pretty good statistic so that developers can learn a bit more how the application consume and use in real world the allocated data.</p>

<p>It also include, in debug mode, a lot of assertion and memory verification which stop as soon as detected the program. This will also help the developper by reducing the time between a memory corruption and it&#39;s detection.</p>

<p>The current SVN version is considered stable and optimized. The TODO is almost complete, but if you want another feature don&#39;t hesitate to ask it !</p>

 summary : <p>The Entity Describer (E.D.) is a mechanism for intersecting the Semantic Web with the normal Web. It lets users tag resources on the Web with terms from structured knowledge representation and organization systems. In the first version, E.D. drew its semantic tags directly from the ontologies of the semantic web. In the present version, these special tags are gathered from the millions of topics in the Freebase database. In addition E.D. has been extended so that it is possible to use databases other than Freebase.  Currently E.D. may be used with Connotea.  This means the tags are stored in the Connotea bookmark management site in addition to being stored into ED&#39;s database. </p>

<p>What is Freebase?Freebase is a highly structured collaborative online database.  It contains data harvested from different sources (Wikipedia, MusicBrainz) and data that has been added by individuals.  You can add your own data to Freebase!   </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>In addition, The Entity Describer can also be used with other databases that conform to the API.  Download it and customize it </p>

<p>Please see this google doc for the API specifications: DataSource API  </p>

 title : The entropic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Entropic(ĕn-trō&#39;pĭk) - A timekeeping application that utilizes the concept of quick entries or &quot;traces&quot; of time will help keep things simple and make the downtime between &quot;switching gears&quot; less of a drag.  </p>

<p>The ideaThe idea began when I realized how much time was spent recording where I spent my time; project-wise, work-wise.  I started out with a piece of paper in a simple notepad and just kept logging things like, &quot;Work Order: 12431; 15 minutes; Updated documentation.&quot; </p>

<p>It took a larger effort at the end of the week to help aggregate those &quot;traces&quot; of time into a bigger note, to be placed into the corporate work-order / trouble-ticket database.   </p>

<p>Granted, I am a big subscriber to the &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; way of work-life, and I do recommend the other GTD products out there as well. (43, etc.)  What I needed was a way to just &quot;diary&quot; my time and where it was spent.  Sort of from &quot;the other direction.&quot; </p>

<p>Also, I figured if I could log my time in a quick manner, it would help to deter me from surfing around the web in that &quot;I just changed gears from project A to project B and need to focus&quot; mood.   </p>

<p>There are a few reports, some snazzy flash, thanks to pullmonkey.com&#39;s introduction to Open Flash Charts. </p>

<p>The statusPlease visit our discussion group located here: entropic-discuss </p>

<p>14JAN2009 The project is in a pretty stable state - I&#39;m using it on a daily basis at work, and the reports are what I need, in terms up reporting.  Time needs to be spent tweaking a few little visual bugs or quirks here and there, as well as writing complete tests. </p>

 title : The enumgen Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOTE: This project is new.  The code generator is fully functional and feature rich, now fully unit tested.  The implementation of the generated interface is now complete as well.  Feel free to take a look by downloading the code from subversion (click the Source link) if you&#39;d like and giving it a try.  Feedback welcome. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to show examples than to write documentation (but it&#39;s coming).  Here&#39;s an example where Fruit.enum is the input, and Fruit.hpp, Fruit.ipp, and Fruit.cpp are generated as a result. http://code.google.com/p/enumgen/source/browse/#svn/trunk/demo </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a C++ programmer, I hope you find this useful, and recognize the amount of effort put into generating clean and efficient C++ code.   </p>

<p>Why enumgen? </p>

<p>C++ classes have desirable properties that regular enum types do not yet(*) have.  Some of the benefits class hold over raw enums are are: </p>

<p>classes are forward-declarable, enums are not. (yet) classes can prevent implicit conversions to ints classes can have member functions and are generally extensible, enums are not. Therefore I created a code-gen tool which reads a simple input file and generates a complete C++ class (header/implementation files) for you to include in your projects and use directly instead of regular enums. </p>

<p>Additional benefits: </p>

<p>user provided code can extend the generated class interface a fairly extensive introspection interface for the generated code to query the enumerator names, values, and aliases ability to create enum objects out of strings that spell their name or one of their aliases ability to ask an enum object for a string representation of its enum value The code generator itself is written in Common Lisp.  Currently I&#39;ve tested with CLISP, SBCL, and ECL, but it should be simple enough to get working elsewhere.  You&#39;ll need to install a CL implementation to generate C++ code, however, once you generate your C++ source files, they can be compiled into your C++ project without the need for a lisp environment whatsoever.  There is absolutely no dependency on lisp except to run the code generator itself.   </p>

<p>(*) I&#39;m aware of the future C++0x standard and new strongly-typed, forward-declarable enums.  However that will only help improve this generated code, and does not obviate it.  One reason is the ability to have MEMBER FUNCTIONS of an enum is still not on the table.  I plan to make heavy use of these new enum functions as the new standard implementations become available and widespread.</p>

 summary : <p>EPBP </p>

<p>See the EPBP official website for more information: http://epbp.earlz.biz.tm  </p>

<p>EPBP is a portable bytecode project. It is designed to resemble an actual machine from the bytecode/assembler point of view. It is designed in this way so that real programming languages can be ported to compile to this bytecode format. </p>

<p>Emulated Machine Info: </p>

<p>The strangest feature of the emulated machine is that there are no true registers. There is a registers mechanism however. This is implemented by register banks. Register banks make it so an area of memory can be mapped so that this area of memory can be addressed by using only 1 byte. </p>

<p>For getting &quot;outside&quot; the emulation, there is a method of external callings of system functions. This is called &quot;xcall&quot;. This must be used for things such as printing to screen, or drawing graphics, or other external functions. </p>

<p>This Implementation: </p>

<p>EPBP is encouraged to be implemented by people other than me. I only wish to make a decent, but basic implementation demonstrating all of the opcodes and how xcall-able libraries can work.  </p>

<p>This Is The Concept Version: </p>

<p>This is only the concept version. This is done to prove the concept and to make it easy for current developers to develop on the EPBP platform. This version is 32bit and the FPU functions are elementary at best. The expected eventual version will be 64bit and the FPU functions will be very elegant including all the functions expected of an FPU. </p>

<p>Interested? </p>

<p>At this point, the code is no where near a working demo. If you find this project interesting though, please feel free to contact me at &quot;earlz?at?earlz.biz.tm&quot; by email for any questions. I am looking for some help with this project. You don&#39;t just have to add code, I am looking for someone just to bounce ideas off of that has some experience with bytecode. Of course, I am always looking for programmers, documenters, and testers to help me with the project.</p>

<p>Some advantages to using Epy instead of writing your own Javascript might include: </p>

<p>Familiar reusable Pythonic design Easy class construction Easy iterables (including custom iterables) Namespaces! Best of all, less Javascript!

 summary : <p>随着信息化进程的不断深入，各种信息管理系统在各个行业中发挥着重要作用。信息管理系统运作过程中，一个很重要的步骤就是信息的数字化。当前常用的做法是系统提供一个表单界面，由操作人员手工填写各个输入项，然后提交给系统存储到数据库中。 
<br/>这种模式简单可行，易于实现，却存在着不少的问题。对系统操作人员而言，当录入信息，十分繁琐，工作量大，效率低下，而且正确率难以保证。其次，录入的信息只能应用在系统内部，系统间却没有相应的共享机制。如果不同的系统录入的信息相似度很高，则会导致信息的重复录入，对人力物力造成极大的浪费。一个典型的例子是图书管理系统，不同的机构（出版社，图书馆，书店，网上书店，书评应用服务等）录入的书刊信息基本上是一致的，录入工作却要分别进行，导致了大量的重复工作。 
<br/>如果信息系统能通过统一通用的接口获取到相应的信息，即可实现表单的自动录入，免除了系统操作人员手工录入的繁琐操作，提高信息录入的速度和准确率。基于网络数据采集的智能表单录入系统(Ergate)的提出，为信息系统的自动录入提供了可能性。Ergate使用多种途径从网络获取数据，利用网络搜索技术和数据库技术，形成一个稳定准确的数据源，并以标准通用的Web服务协议对外发布。需要信息录入、而且信息具有重复性的应用均可通过使用Ergate 系统实现信息的自动录入，从而增强用户的使用体验。 
<br/>当前有大量信息系统录入的信息存在重复性，如图书馆、书店的图书信息录、商场超市的产品信息以及电子商务中商品信息。通过Ergate系统，上述系统可以免除用户重复输入的繁琐操作，提高用户的使用体验，提高了录入信息的准确率。 
<br/>Ergate具有以下特色：
<br/>网络搜索技术和数据库技术相结合。网络搜索技术保证信息来源的广泛性和实时性，保证了信息数据的完备性和及时性（与最新信息保持同步），同时避免了一般系统数据收集所需的启动时间；数据库技术作为本地缓冲，存储用户搜索的历史信息，提高系统的响应速度，同时为系统数据的自我完善打下基础。 数据整理智能化。系统接收到搜索引擎返回的相关数据时，通过指定规则将其排序，向用户返回最优数据。如果其中的最优信息出现信息缺失，系统可以实现信息的自动重组，组合多条信息以满足用户需求。 数据采集采用以网络数据自动采集为主，信息权威机构（如出版社，产品生产厂商等）参与为辅的策略。引入信息权威机构的参与可以提高信息的有效性和准确性，增强用户体验。 系统引入用户反馈系统和信息评价系统，实现系统的自我完善。 通过Web服务标准协议发布，做到平台无关，语言无关，模型无关（C/S或者B/S），适用范围广，使用简单。 可以实现数据的单个录入和批量录入，以满足不同的需要。</p>

 title : The erlang-dhcp-server Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network. DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), adding the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network addresses and additional configuration options.  DHCP captures the behavior of BOOTP relay agents, and DHCP participants can interoperate with BOOTP participants. This program is a high performance multithreaded DHCP server written entirely in Erlang. It strives to be fully functional, and RFC compliant. The main advantages of erlang-dhcp-server compared to other DHCP servers are performance and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes from Erlang as well. Network servers don&#39;t have to be written in ugly adhoc languages.</p>

 title : The erlfs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>THIS PROJECT IS PRE-ALPHAIt is not ready for testing yet.We just switched to github and we have decided to use a DHT instead of a meshWhat is ErlFS?ErlFS is a system to store files in a highly redundant and highly available way across multiple machines. ErlFS scales linearly. </p>

<p>How does ErlFS work?GeneralErlFS uses distributed Erlang and the chord DHT algorithm. The more nodes you add to the cluster, the more capacity, throughput and redundancy you get. ErlFS is a write-once read-many system. </p>

<p>StorageWhen a file is put into the system, it is split up into chunks and each of those chunks are redundantly copied to the next log(N) nodes&#39; file systems. The meta-data includes the keys to each of the chunks for each particular file, content-type and other common attributes. </p>

<p>RetrievalWhen a file is retrieved, the client retrieves the meta-data from any node, potentially behind a load-balancer, and uses the list of all the nodes for all of the chunks of a file to retrieve each chunk and joins all of them together to recompose the file, resulting in higher throughput under high load.</p>

 title : The erltunnel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An HTTP tunnel allows client applications to establish a virtual TCP connection to a remote server when directly connecting the server is not allowed due to a restrictive firewall. Access from clients behind the firewall to servers located on the internet is often controlled by an intermediate web proxy which permits or denies outgoing connections depending on a set of individually defined access rules. Squid, for example, is a widely used web proxy with fine-grained control of which remote hosts and ports the clients are allowed to connect.  Moreover, Squid can block HTTP requests or responses by inspecting their headers. Most proxies probably permit access to HTTP, HTTPS and FTP servers at their standard ports, but in a most restrictive case, only HTTP at standard port 80 might be allowed. If your client application needs access to some remote server but cannot pass the firewall and adjusting the access rules is not an option (due to configuration cost or lack of permission), the only way to connect to the server is by tunneling the intended connection through a connection that passes the firewall. </p>

<p>An HTTP tunnel software consists of a tunnel client and server. The tunnel client runs behind the firewall and is accessed by the client application whereas the tunnel server must reside on the internet to be able to access the server application. Most notably, the tunnel server must be accessible from the tunnel client and must not be blocked by an intermediate proxy. If a virtual connection between the client and server application is established via the tunnel client and server, all application data is transported as HTTP requests and responses between the tunnel client and server. The tunnel client sends data received from the client as an HTTP request to the tunnel server which relays the data to the server application. Conversely, the tunnel server sends data received from the server application as the related HTTP response back to the tunnel client which relays the data to the client application. Thus, tunneling a bidirectional TCP data stream is performed by periodic HTTP request/response cycles. </p>

<p>Erltunnel is written in Erlang, a functional programming language designed for concurrent and distributed computing.  Erlang is a battle-tested platform particularly for network programming since it provides, among other things, a lightweight, OS-independent process model which makes Erlang cope with a large number of processes. In contrast to heavyweight shared-memory threads, this encourages managing a large number of network connections on a per-process basis. </p>

<p>Erltunnel is an HTTP tunnel with a small set of API functions.  It is tested using the latest Erlang release on Ubuntu Linux but should run as well on other platforms. It is tested in particular to pass the Squid proxy. Remember, however, that whether the tunnel client can connect to the tunnel server may depend on the individually defined access rules.  For example, the HTTP request might be refused because the user-agent header line does not mention the right client application the proxy is configured for. In such a situation you have to adjust the code that produces the header lines in order to match your specific needs. The Erltunnel code is written with focus on simplicity, thus modifying these functions should be straightforward. </p>

<p>Erltunnel currently provides the following features: </p>

<p>tunneling any TCP/IP connections over persistent or non-persistent HTTP connections tunnel client accessible by SOCKS 4 proxy protocol, i.e. client application must understand SOCKS 4 tunneling with or without an intermediate proxy optional proxy authentication (user, password)</p>

 title : The es-operating-system Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>We are creating a new pure component operating system named ES. This project was started by Shiki Okasaka and Kyu Ueno at Nintendo largely affected by Rob Pike&#39;s &quot;Systems Software Research is Irrelevant&quot; talk in 2000. Since 2008, this project has been hosted in Google Code under the copyright of both Google and Nintendo in hope we can reach more people worldwide. </p>

<p>As we realize ECMAScript/Web based applications are becoming very important and useful, ES operating system has been designed to make the Web Apps APIs as the primary operating system interfaces, and to be an extensible operating system by supporting the component technology from the operating system kernel level as originally proposed for the future direction by Noah Mendelsohn in &quot;Operating Systems for Component Software Environments&quot; in 1997. </p>

<p>In ES operating system every system API is defined in Web IDL, a new interface definition language used for defining APIs for Web Apps including HTML5, Web GL, and so forth. New APIs defined in Web IDL can be dynamically added to the system by loading the corresponding new software components running at the user level. With a better security model in the operating system, we should be able to bring better extensibility to the computers and devices connected to the Internet. For example, a web browser could be implemented as a seamless composition of various software components from various companies, communities, and organizations. As the Web is becoming the new platform replacing the traditional operating systems, we believe we will need an extensible operating system like we&#39;re studying with ES operating system. A unique part in ES operating system is we are using Web IDL to generate interfaces for C++ not only for ECMAScript and Java, and the software components written in C++ can be seamlessly controlled from ECMAScript. </p>

<p>The project goals include but not limited to: </p>

<p>a pure component operating system kernel design and development a Web IDL based component object binding runtime implementation for C++ and ECMAScript an HTML5 rendering engine integration a TCP/IP stack implementation based on design pattern </p>

It works by building a index of compulsory substrings from a collection of regular expressions, which it uses to quickly exclude those expressions which trivially do not match each input. </p>

<p>Here is some example code that uses esmre: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import esmre
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index = esmre.Index()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(r&quot;Major-General\W*$&quot;, &quot;savoy opera&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(r&quot;\bway\W+haye?\b&quot;, &quot;sea shanty&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.query(&quot;I am the very model of a modern Major-General.&quot;)
<br/>[&#39;savoy opera&#39;]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.query(&quot;Way, hay up she rises,&quot;)
<br/>[&#39;sea shanty&#39;]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The esmre module builds on the simpler string matching facilities of the esm module, which wraps a C implementation some of the algorithms described in Aho&#39;s and Corasick&#39;s paper on efficient string matching [Aho, A.V, and Corasick, M. J. Efficient String Matching: An Aid to Bibliographic Search. Comm. ACM 18:6 (June 1975), 333-340]. Some minor modifications have been made to the algorithms in the paper and one algorithm is missing (for now), but there is enough to implement a quick string matching index. </p>

<p>Here is some example code that uses esm directly: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import esm
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index = esm.Index()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(&quot;he&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(&quot;she&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(&quot;his&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.enter(&quot;hers&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.fix()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.query(&quot;this here is history&quot;)
<br/>[((1, 4), &#39;his&#39;), ((5, 7), &#39;he&#39;), ((13, 16), &#39;his&#39;)]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; index.query(&quot;Those are his sheep!&quot;)
<br/>[((10, 13), &#39;his&#39;), ((14, 17), &#39;she&#39;), ((15, 17), &#39;he&#39;)]
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; You can see more usage examples in the tests.</p>

 title : The esperanto-korpuso Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Por konstrui bonajn lingvistikajn ilojn, kiel ekz. vortlistoj, vortaroj k.t.p. bezonatas korpuson; kolekto de tekstoj en la lingvo. </p>

<p>Tiu ĉi projekto enhavas ilojn por fari korpuson en Esperanto (sed la principo kaj la kodo verŝajne utilas ankaŭ al aliaj malgrandaj lingvoj): </p>

<p>A) Serĉmaŝino (kiu uzas Guglo serĉ-API) kiu trovas retpaĝojn en Esperanto kaj konstruas komencan liston de adresoj (URLoj). </p>

<p>B) Interreta rampilo (angle: web crawler - nun ni uzas WebSPHINX sed eble estonte Heritrix) por trarampi kaj amasigi hejmpaĝojn en Esperanto. Se ne-Esperanta paĝo estas trafita ĝi estas forĵetita. </p>

<p>C) Stokaj aŭ procesaj moduloj por la korpuso estos eble aldonota. </p>

<p>Plejparto de ka kodo estas en Javo sed kelkaj partoj estas en Perlo kaj Ruby. </p>

<p>La projekto estas nun uzata de: - http://corp.hum.sdu.dk/cqp.eo.html  (http://visl.sdu.dk/) </p>

<p>Estonte ni esperas ke ankaŭ la sekvaj projektoj povas utiligi la laboron: - &#39;OFTECA  VORTARO  DE  ESPERANTO&#39; (http://www.esperanto.freenet.tj/vortaroj/oftec.htm) </p>

<p>Aliaj eblecoj fari korpuson- the free BootCat tools (skribita en Perl):  http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/bootcat.html </p>

<p>CrúbadánCorpus building for minority languages - http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/. La aŭtoro, Kevin, verŝajnoe povos (somere 2008) produkti korpuson de 30 milionoj da vortoj por ni </p>

<p>English resumeTo build good language tools, such as word list and dictionaries  you need a corpus; a large collection of texts in the language. </p>

<p>This project consists of tools to generate an Esperanto corpus (but the principle and the code will probably work just fine for other smaller languages as well): </p>

<p>A) A search engine (that uses Google search API) that finds web pages in Esperanto and generates an initial list of URLs. </p>

<p>B) A web crawler (that currently uses WebSPHINX but we might change to Heritrix) to crawl the web to build up a corpus of Esperanto web pages. If a non-Esperanto page is detected it is left out of the crawl. </p>

<p>C) Storing or processing modules for the corpus might be added later. </p>

<p>Most the code is written in Java but some optional pieces are written in Perl and Ruby.</p>

 title : The essential-c Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionI began writing what would become this library back in 2004.  At the time, I was developing a semi-structured database called Spinneret, which was to be a sensical merging of the relational database concepts that I had  utilized throughout my life and the native XML concept which I helped to pioneer.  It would have featured dynamic storage and flexible data representation (JSON, XML, YAML, etc).  Unfortunately, Spinneret was never to be, so this code sat around for quite some time before I decided that it should be released to the public. </p>

<p>So What Is It?Well, it&#39;s a library that does &#39;stuff&#39; for you.  When I stay &#39;stuff,&#39; I mean that it performs a variety of tasks including collection management thread and signal abstraction, and specialized memory management.   </p>

<p>Presently, Essential-C includes the following C routines: </p>

<p>Collection Management Lists - I&#39;ve taken a slightly different approach in my List management code.  While many toolkit developers choose to implement List collections using singly or doubly linked lists, I&#39;ve instead decided to implement something I call a Clustered List, where a doubly-linked set of nodes are managed, each node pointing to a cluster of many items.  This improves random seek time because less walking has to occur, and it also means less calls to memory allocation routines when a lot of activity is occurring.  There may be a formal name for this method, but I&#39;m too lazy to look it up. Tables - Again, while some toolkit developers would opt to implement a very basic hash table where the entire set grows by a particular ratio every time its storage threshold is reached, I&#39;ve decided to implement my Tables as in-memory Linear Hash tables.  The benefit here is that the table will grow linearly rather than geometrically, thus avoiding the kind of memory consumption for which hash-tables have historically been notorious. Stacks and Queues - These are simple Stack and Queue set implementations based on the Clustered List routines. Memory Management Memory Chains - Because it was originally written to serve as the foundation for a database server, the memory management routines were written with transactions in mind, and in particular the ability for a developer to create a chain of memory that, upon completion of a particular transaction, can be removed in its entirety with a single API call.  Reference Counting - The memory management routines also support Objective-C style retain and release reference counting, if one so desires to utilize it. Signal Abstraction - A simple way to register potentially many signal handlers for any particular signal.   Thread Abstraction - Wraps the host operating system&#39;s threading APIs so that a developer can perform simple threading and synchronization without having to be familiar with any particular native API. And Much, MUCH More!  Not really much more than that, but it&#39;s a starting point for bigger and better things.  So long as those things remain focused and simple.</p>

 summary : <p>Mission &amp; main goals.We must develop comfortable, high quality &amp;amp; clear framework, suitable to resolve all main tasks of web development. This framework will be base for future CMS and we will be first users of it. And we will first users of this CMS when we will develop our web projects. </p>

<p>Main keywords, ranged by importance: clear development, flexibility, good performance. </p>

<p>We are the experienced web developers, so our framework and future CMS are not targeted for the end users, but only for men like we are. For the end users we need to create only front end, with settings and number of predefined objects and features. But, if anybody need add some specials, be sure to learn programming :) </p>

<p>And, maybe after we create great collection of those features, and our front end will be best of the best, only in this time we can publish our creature to the users. </p>

<p>Little bit about performance of our framework. I&#39;ve placed performance to the end couse optimization before you exactly know that program need to be optimized is the worse way. Only when testing on real projects will show us, that CMS is too much slow in the most environments we will start optimization. But we think, that included to the kernel possibility to cache full or part of output will clear all troubles with performance. If NO, then good development strategy, flexibility and OOP philosophy will help us to add any level of cashing and any optimization mechanism to our software.</p>

<p>Eurasia 的读法在这里 </p>

<p>Eurasia3Eurasia3 被設計成用于解決百萬級同時在线的長連接用戶數量的 HTTP 服務器, 或者每秒種處理上萬次 CGI 請求的常規 Web 應用服務器。 </p>

<p>Eurasia3 向下兼容 AJAX (難道 AJAX 對服務器有要求嗎?), 但是她不推薦您使用落後的 AJAX 模式來摧殘用戶和程序員, 她正在嘗試使用諸如 Pushlet (Comet 是 Pushlet 的炒作版本) 一類的有趣技術來改變 Web 的開發面貌。 </p>

<p>歡迎黑客們加入 Eurasia3 用戶組, 但是請注意, 我不會向 Lusers 和 Trolls 發出任何警告。 </p>

<p>Eurasia2Eurasia2 是一種和 TurboGears 同時開始設計并且最後理念撞車的 Web 應用框架。隨著 Eurasia2 與 Plone 的融合逐漸深入, Eurasia2 和 TurboGears 流派終于分道揚鑣。對 Eurasia2 來說 TurboGears 就是 Django, 因為它沒能融合 Plone 而重復造了太多輪子。 </p>

<p>Eurasia2 在最近幾年也被用于實際的開發應用。但是過于古老, 據我所知目前已經退出生產領域。無論如何, 即使和 Eurasia3 相比 Eurasia2 仍然有許多不可磨滅的精妙之處。恰可以在學術領域繼續為框架設計者提供靈感。本站提供 Eurasia2 下載。 </p>

<p>Eurasia2 安裝您需要 Python2.4, Windows 用戶直接點擊 Eurasia-2.0.2.exe 安裝。 </p>

<p>1. 安装软件包(Unix) </p>

<p>/PATH/TO/PYTHON/bin/python2.4 /PATH/TO/EURASIA/setup.py install </p>

<p>2. 建立新站點 </p>

<p>You can pass it an argument to evaluate or invoke it with no arguments and enter an interactive mode that&#39;s sort of like bc. In interactive mode, the script will evaluate the expression each time you press Return and assign the results to a variable that you can use later. You can name the variables yourself if you&#39;d like, as well as save and restore sets of variables from a file. </p>

<p>Exacute respects the http_proxy environment variable, so you can use it at work. Also, if you have the Ruby bindings for GNU Readline installed, you get command editing, history, and autocompletion.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a collection of ideas for a system mean&#39;t for scientific experimentation and simulation. </p>

<p>The project concept uses a virtual machine, that aims to implement a C-like, typed, high level language, and an assembler that uses a machine independent lisp-like syntax. 
<br/>Like the goal of the project, the language implementation is still in an experimentation state. The expected procedure to specify experiments is to have one or more source files that describe the environment, while the system provides an interactive visual interface where data can be manipulated. 
<br/>In other words, the project is too bold in what it aims, and probably will never get anywhere. But should be an interesting place to invest time, as a hobby, when not playing games, watching films, or having a social life :-)</p>

 summary : <p>The original implementation of Ext.layout.CardLayout does not check wether an &quot;active item&quot; was successfully hidden (which might not be the case if any of the listeners attached to the item&#39;s beforehide-event returned &quot;false&quot;). This class overrides the &quot;setActiveItem&quot;-method and sets only the chosen item as &quot;active&quot;, if the previously active item was successfully hidden.</p>

 title : The extjsfilemanager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I abstracted this file manager from another sytem I have been writing, but I think alot of people would find parts of it useful, namely the image editing. It uses a couple open source PHP classes for JSON encoding and image manipulation (using the GD library), and should work on just about any standard PHP 4/5 installation. </p>

<p>Also included are some examples of how to tie the file manager into other applications using a FileChooser and an ImageChooser. I have used these to implement custom TinyMCE file and image choosers.... The code should be pretty extendable (as it was based on some of jacks examples).</p>

 summary : <p>Extrods is a collection of extensions for iRODS, Rule Oriented Data Systems. IRODS is the next generation of data management cyberinfrastructure.  </p>

<p>Currently, extrods consists of the following projects: </p>

<p>JargonJava client API  </p>

<p>ProdsPHP client API </p>

<p>iRODS browserAn Ajax based web client, design for end-users. iRODS browser installation requires Prods for its web services. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Contributed SoftwareiRODS RPMRPM packages of server (both ICAT and non-ICAT) packages and client commands. Support for Oracle and Postgres ICATs and GSI auth. The repository provides patches and extra source bundles along with the RPM package spec files and source RPMs for use on any supported system. </p>

<p>DEBInitial packages of iRODS server and client for Ubuntu are now downloadable. These have been compiled using Ubuntu 8.04 to support a Postgres ICAT using the distribution versions of Postgres and unixODBC (though it seems that a version of unixODBC more recent than 2.2.11 is required to run correctly). If different compilation configurations are required then obtain the sources from Subversion and edit the debian/rules file as appropriate and then rebuild the package. Various combinations will be created and uploaded to this repository over the next few weeks. </p>

 title : The extsharp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I really love Ext but coding in javascript just gives me the chills. So I went out and found a way to use my favorite js library (Ext) and my favorite programming language (C#) at the same time. By using a project called Script# I am able to write C# code and have it converted into javascript, similar to GWT. Building on that, Script# also allows you to code against external APIs, but you need to create the types, methods, properties, etc. for everything in the javascript library. So what I did was write a little console app that parses all of the ExtJS source files extracting out the script comments and writing C# files for each class. The end result is a programmable C# API to access all of the Ext objects and I threw in a couple new things to make life a little easier. </p>

<p>This forum post has somewhat of a history of how this project began: http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=12901 </p>

<p>UPDATE 4/22/08We have changed Ext# to now parse the newly released ExtJS 2.1 and we&#39;ve begun recreating some of the samples using Ext#. The following Samples have been completed: </p>

<p>Grids Basic Array Grid Editable Grid XML Grid Paging Grid Grouping Grid Toolbars and Menus Basic Toolbar Ext Actions Miscellaneous Data View (partial) Progress Bar Templates Panels Resizable A big thanks to consultutah for all of his help creating these samples.

 title : The eyetunes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutEyeTunes.framework is a Cocoa Framework that abstracts away all the ugly Carbon Apple Events magic and allows you to directly control iTunes from any Cocoa Application. </p>

<p>FeaturesGet all references to iTunes playlists, tracks and album art. Set any writable fields that iTunes exposes such as Track name, artwork and much more. Control iTunes and select playlists and tracks by using either track filenames or database ids. Search the iTunes library just like the search box does. Extract persistent ID and fetch tracks using such ids. ExampleTo grab an NSImage from the current playing track (say you&#39;re implementing some new album art viewier), you can use this simple snippet: </p>

<p>    #import 
<br/>    
<br/>    - (NSImage *) getArtworkOfPlayingSong {
<br/>        EyeTunes *eyetunes = [EyeTunes sharedInstance];
<br/>        ETTrack *currentTrack = [eyetunes currentTrack];
<br/>        if (!currentTrack)
<br/>           return nil;</p>

<p>        return [[currentTrack artwork] objectAtIndex:0];
<br/>     }To see more examples of how to use EyeTunes in your projects, look at the EyeTunesDebug main.m. </p>

<p>Building and Using EyeTunesYou need Mac OS X 10.4 and Xcode 2.x. EyeTunes itself is written for iTunes 6.0, but possibly works with iTunes 4.7 without and problems except access to some fields may return an error. </p>

<p>Obtaining EyeTunesIt is highly recommended you checkout the latest source from SVN rather than the release tarball. </p>

<p>To checkout through SVN, install Subversion. if you haven&#39;t already (via Webkit) and type this command in the terminal: </p>

<p>   svn checkout http://eyetunes.googlecode.com/svn/EyeTunes/trunk/ eyetunesOtherwise, grab a download form the EyeTunes. See: ChangeLog. </p>

<p>Building/Including EyeTunesYou will probably want to include it in your project rather than building it standalone. There are two ways to include the code into your project.  </p>

<p>First one is to just copy all the files into your project and add them to your target. This way you do not have to deal with copying the framework into your YourApplication.app/Contents/Frameworks. </p>

<p>The second method, is probably the preferred method because it means you can build a version of EyeTunes and never have to worry about it again. </p>

<p> Build the EyeTunes project as usual using the target EyeTunes.framework and Deployment build type in Xcode. 2. Drag the resulting framework from Finder (located in ./EyeTunes/build/Deployment/) into your Project&#39;s framework tree. You will probably be prompted to add to a target. 
<br/>3. Now add a new Project Build Phase to your target called Copy Files. 
<br/>4. In the properties of this Build Phase, select &quot;Frameworks&quot; as the type and drag the EyeTunes.framework from your project tree into this build phase. For more information on this, please read the Apple Documentation or CocoaDev on Embedding Frameworks.</p>

 title : The ezero Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it ?Ezero project is a set of tools for aiding the development of Edje interfaces. </p>

<p>It&#39;s composed by three parts: </p>

<p>EDC code APIThe API comprehends factory methods and classes that represent edje &quot;blocks&quot;. </p>

<p>For example, creating an image part can be done with a factory method by passing the image&#39;s information. This factory method will return an object that will be later used by our EDC builder to mount the EDC file. </p>

<p>Instead of writing all the EDC code for the part and adding the info by hand, the EDC builder will do that for you.  </p>

<p>Some edje &quot;blocks&quot; also contain another &quot;blocks&quot;. By using EDC code API, you will be able add a block inside another, composing the tree. </p>

<p>EDC builderThe EDC builder do all the work of writing. All you need to do is to pass him the lowest level block (i.e. the &quot;root&quot;). It will dive inside your object and print the tree as you composed it before. </p>

<p>Edje Visual EditorThis is future work. </p>

<p>ContextEdje interfaces are written on its own C-like syntax in a .edc (Edje Data Collection) file, which has its compiled .edj form (edje_cc). In the C code (or python), the programmer sets his callbacks for the interface components (e.g. clicking a &#39;play&#39; button in a media player interface). For bigger interfaces, your EDC file might achieve unexpected sizes, and eventually lose maintainability. </p>

 summary : <p>The new ActionScript 3.0 Client Library for Facebook Platform API, fully supported by Facebook and Adobe, makes it easy to build applications that combine the strengths of the Flash Platform and Facebook Platform. </p>

<p>The Adobe Flash Platform and Facebook Platform provide the ideal solution for building rich, social experiences on the web. Flash is available on more than 98% of Internet-connected PCs, so people can immediately access the applications, content, and video that enable social interactions. The Facebook Platform is used by millions of people everyday to connect and share with the people in their lives. Together, both platforms allow you to: </p>

<p>Share: Create rich interactions for users to share with friends. Have fun: Make games social; let users compete against their friends. Connect: Let users connect to your RIAs with Facebook Connect. Solve problems: Build RIAs that harness the power of community. Reach people: Reach millions of Facebook users through social distribution. Getting StartedFor tutorials, articles, and videos on using the new API, visit the Facebook page on the Adobe Developer Center. You can also see the docs for the most recent and stable build. </p>

<p>Project HistoryThe API was originally developed by Jason Crist and authored under the direction of Terralever, an online marketing firm with strength in Flash-based media. Although Adobe has taken over day-to-day management of the project, Jason still maintains a consulting role. Under the direction of Adobe, the highly experienced team of Flash and Flex experts from gskinner.com have developed and architected the latest iteration of the API. </p>

<p>IntroductionAs of May 2008, Facebook has discontinued any support of their official Java client, directing users interested developing Facebook applications in Java to use one of the various third-party clients out there.  As such, the purpose of this project is now to maintain, support, and extend the abandoned code base to p</p>
 title : The facebook-java-webapp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis application aims to provide a quick and easy way for building Java Web Applications for Facebook. </p>

<p>It aims to provide a fast-track and all-inclusive dive deep into how the Facebook Web Applications can be built. So you can take this projects as an application model then you refactor it to meet your company&#39;s need. </p>

<p>Since it builds on top of open source tools, this project builds on top of proven frameworks. Like spring, struts, hibernate, tiles, etc. And it&#39;s free!. </p>

<p>One of the open source projects that facebook-java-webapp builds on top of is the facebook-java-api which is the open source project for keeping the compatibility of the java client for the REST facebook servers. </p>

<p>Showcased here: http://apps.new.facebook.com/java-webapp/ </p>

<p>What can I expect now?Facebook Java API Integration Sending a notification on a user&#39;s action Publish a feed story using a FeedStory form Publish a feed through an API method call Register, list and deactivate all of an application&#39;s template bundles (TemplateBundleRegisterImpl) Validate facebook request Add users - when the user authorizes your application, they are stored in the database using Hibernate Spring integration Usage of Spring MVC as the web layer Hibernate integration as the ORM tool, includes the managing of the session within a request response lifecycle Maven, including the creation of the Database Schema Extensionless URLs Tiles as part of the View layer of the Spring MVC Json-lib is used for rendering jason objects Project&#39;s Roadmap (What can I expect in the future?)For release 0.3Make examples in JSP&#39;s of ALL the FBML tags. For release 0.4Support Struts 2 as the Web MVC framework in a separate folder Integration with Facebook API REST Client for retrieval of friend data Change logRelease 0.2 DoneSupport Struts 2 as the Web MVC framework in a separate folder moved to Release 0.4 Add the database layer, to showcase a simple Add and Remove of a user Add an ORM layer with Hibernate Add sending notifications on certain user actions Add sending of a mini-feed, both through a trigger in the UI and the source code For security concerns add the md5 sum of the jar files moved to &quot;Nice to have&quot; Integration with Facebook API REST Client for retrieval of friend data moved to Release 0.4 &quot;Nice to have&quot;For security concerns add the md5 sum of the jar files How to build and deployDownload the latest release from the download folder Put the war into an application server It should undeploy, configure the file under WEB-INF/lib/facebook.properties to your application specifications How to create the database schema$ cd trunk/springwebmvc-hibernate</p>

 summary : <p>This project is an extension + windows port of the project csuFaceIdEval v.5 originally developed by Colorado State University. If you have any questions regarding the original project, please refer to following link http://www.cs.colostate.edu/evalfacerec/ </p>

<p>The original project implements four base algorithms and infrastructure to evaluate namely  </p>

<p>1) A standard PCA, or Eigenfaces, algorithm  </p>

<p>2) A combination PCA and LDA algorithm based upon the University of Maryland algorithm in the FERET tests. </p>

<p>3) A Bayesian Intrapersonal/Extrapersonal Image Difference Classifier based upon the MIT algorithm in the FERET tests. </p>

<p>4) An Elastic Bunch Graph Matching Algorithm that uses localized landmark features represented by Gabor jets. This algorithm is based upon the USC algorithm in the FERET</p>

<p>script/plugin install  http://facetime.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/facetimeCheck out the project wiki for instructions and documentation. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in participating or providing feedback, stop by the Facetime group or file a ticket using the issue tracker. </p>

<p>Improved test coverage, sample code and documentation, and any feedback or thoughts you may have, would be especially helpful in bringing the library to a production-ready level. </p>

<p>Facetime&#39;s aim is to be a Facebook interface that’s borderline indisguishable from other Rails code — meaning its understandable, enjoyable, and doesn’t require hours of pouring through Facebook’s API documentation. </p>

Do we need one more to that list? Famree is an open-source project (that means FREE!!) allowing you to run your own  
<br/>family tree. It is highly customizable. It is a web based application with a rich user  
<br/>interface and not a desktop version. Plus, I haven’t come across any ancestry project  
<br/>that provides the exhaustive list of features provided by Famree. 
<br/>How can I build my family tree? Famree takes a top-down approach. You start with the root of the family (example: your  
<br/>great grand-father) and work your way down. To add a member to the tree, the member’s  
<br/>parent or spouse must belong to the family tree. 
<br/>Can I add my spouse&#39;s parents&#39; family details? Not at present. The current version of Famree is intended for a single family. 
<br/>Who can add or update a family member? To add or update information, you need to be a ‘Manager’ or ‘Administrator’.  Obviously  
<br/>Administrators have more powers. Your site administrator can provide you necessary  
<br/>access. 
<br/>How can I keep informed about the upcoming events in the family? You can subscribe to the RSS feed available below the Timeline chart.

<p>- DB exploration: it shows the first 200 lines of the database </p>

<p>- DB Analysis: the number of lines, proteins and peptides generated after digestion by an enzyme are reported. Five different enzymes are supported at this time, and the user can specify the number of missed cleavages, minimum and maximum masses for peptide generation. </p>

<p>- Decoy DB generation: a decoy database is generated using the specified DB. Three strategies of decoy generation are supported (reverse, random and pseudo-random). The new DB can be attached to the original. </p>

<p>- DB Search: a simple text or a list of terms can be introduced to be searched inside the DB.      The headers or the sequences can be scanned, into three general strategies: </p>

<p>earch headers to generate a sub-DB in fasta format earch sequences to generate a sub-DB in fasta format earch sequences to generate a peptide-protein pairs list earch sequences to generate a protein-peptide pairs list </p>

 title : The fastdfs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FastDFS is an open source high performance distributed file system (DFS). It&#39;s major functions include: file storing, file syncing and file accessing, and design for high capacity and load balancing. </p>

<p>FastDFS is an open source high performance distributed file system. It&#39;s major functions include: file storing, file syncing and file accessing (file uploading and file downloading), and it can resolve the high capacity and load balancing problem. FastDFS should meet the requirement of the website whose service based on files such as photo sharing site and vidio sharing site. </p>

<p>FastDFS has two roles: tracker and storage. The tracker takes charge of scheduling and load balancing for file access. The storage store files and it&#39;s function is file management including: file storing, file syncing, providing file access interface. It also manage the meta data which are attributes representing as key value pair of the file. For example: width=1024, the key is &quot;width&quot; and the value is &quot;1024&quot;. </p>

<p>The tracker and storage contain one or more servers. The servers in the tracker or storage cluster can be added to or removed from the cluster by any time without affecting the online services. The servers in the tracker cluster are peer to peer. </p>

<p>The storarge servers organizing by the file volume/group to obtain high capacity. The storage system contains one or more volumes whose files are independent among these volumes. The capacity of the whole storage system equals to the sum of all volumes&#39; capacity. A file volume contains one or more storage servers whose files are same among these servers. The servers in a file volume backup each other, and all these servers are load balancing. When adding a storage server to a volume, files already existing in this volume are replicated to this new server automatically, and when this replication done, system will switch this server online to providing storage services. When the whole storage capacity is insufficiency, you can add one or more volumes to expand the storage capacity. To do this, you need to add one or more storage servers. </p>

<p>The identification of a file is composed of two parts: the volume name and the file name.</p>
 title : The fastdht Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FastDHT is a high-performance distributed hash system (DHT) which based key value pairs. It can store mass key value pairs such as filename mapping, session data and user related data. </p>

<p>FastDHT uses the Berkeley DB as data storage to support mass data and libevent as network IO to support huge connections. FastDHT implements data replication by it&#39;s binlog file, so it only uses the basic storage function of the Berkeley DB.   FastDHT cluster composes of one or many groups and a group contains one or more servers. The data on a group is same and data is synchronized only among the servers of the same group. The servers of a group are coordinative, so which server is selected to access according to the key&#39;s hash code. The source server pushes the data to other servers in the group. </p>

<p>The client of FastDHT decides which server to be selected. When select which server to access, we use the key&#39;s hash code to avoid lookuping the constrast table. The step of the algorithm is: </p>

<p>calculate the hash code of the key group_index = hash_code % group_count new_hash_code = (hash_code &lt;&lt; 16) | (hash_code &gt;&gt; 16) server_index = new_hash_code % server_count_in_the_group </p>

<p>In FastDHT, the key contains three fields: namespace, object ID and key name. These three concepts are like those of the database system:  </p>

<p>namespace vs database name object ID vs table name key name vs field name The purpose of namespace is resolving the probable data conflict between multiple users such as the different applications or products. The purpose of object ID is convenient for organization and management of object related data such as user&#39;s data and increasing the whole performance. The sytem is more flexible as namespace and object ID are imported. These two fields can be empty in some cases. The input of the hash function (it&#39;s result is hash code) is: If namespace and object ID are not empty, the concatenation of these two fields, or the key name. </p>

<p>FastDHT imports the concept of logic group which is used to avoid re-hashing when the system scales. A physical group is composed of one or more real servers. It can contains one or more logic groups. A FastDHT server supports several logic groups and the data of a logic group is stored to a single Berkeley DB file. This design provides more convenience for scaling. We can use a larger number of logic groups at the beginning. When system scaled, one or more logic groups are migrated to the new physical group(s). All things we need to do are: </p>

<p>copy the Berkeley DB data file to the new servers change the config file restart the programs of the FastDHT servers restart the programs of the FastDHT clients if necessary </p>

<p>FastDHT supports timeout and every key has timeout attribute. FastDHT can be used to store session data which is more efficient and more simple than the traditional database.</p>

The raw Firebird/Interbase-API is very awkward and hard to work with, while fbsql is easy and straight-forward like for example the sqlite- and mysql-APIs are. Currently C and Lisp are supported. fbsql uses IBPP, a C++ Interbase/Firebird API for it&#39;s implementation. It&#39;s basically just a thin wrapper around IBPP to make it accessible in C, and therefore in any other language. </p>

<p>Supported PlatformsCurrent Linux with GCC, Windows with mingw and Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 are tested. The code is rather portable, so I believe on every platform where the firebird client-library and IBPP are accessible, fbsql will work, too. As for the Lisp-library, I&#39;ve only tested it with CLISP on Linux, yet. Again, this should be rather portable to most Lisp-implementations and platforms, too. </p>

<p>Example CodeHere&#39;s an example C-code which connects to a database and selects the IDs of the table &quot;test&quot;: </p>

<p>#include &quot;fbsql.h&quot;
<br/>#include 
<br/>#include </p>

<p>int main() {
<br/>   struct fbsql_database    *db;
<br/>   struct fbsql_transaction *tr;
<br/>   struct fbsql_statement   *st;
<br/>   int id;
<br/>   db = fbsql_database_new(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;/pub/firebird/Test1.fdb&quot;,&quot;sysdba&quot;,&quot;5735&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;iso8859_1&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
<br/>   fbsql_database_connect(db);</p>

<p>   tr = fbsql_transaction_new_with_defaults(db);
<br/>   fbsql_transaction_start(tr);</p>

<p>   st = fbsql_statement_new(db,tr);
<br/>   fbsql_statement_prepare(st,&quot;select id from test&quot;);
<br/>   fbsql_statement_execute(st);
<br/>   while(fbsql_statement_fetch(st)) {
<br/>      if( fbsql_statement_get_integer(st, 1, &amp;id) )
<br/>         printf(&quot;ID: NULL\n&quot;);
<br/>      else
<br/>         printf(&quot;ID: %d\n&quot;,id);
<br/>   }
<br/>   fbsql_statement_close(st);
<br/>   fbsql_statement_delete(st);
<br/>   fbsql_transaction_rollback(tr);
<br/>   fbsql_transaction_delete(tr);

<p>News16 December 2008: My time has been limited by work, but I do still actively (though less frequently) maintain, and strive towards a new release.  Last week I identified a small bug in the options menu.  I fixed it and committed the change to subversion.  See the update log for more. </p>

<p>22 October 2008: Obviously I didn&#39;t get any actual release done the previous week as planned.  I finished my 2-year work contract with the Peace Corps and now I&#39;ve travelling briefly as a vacation before I get home to the States.  I get home  the 2nd week of November, so I&#39;ll put together a release candidate or a full release. </p>

<p>Remember, the SVN code is nearly complete.  The only caveat is that it can&#39;t be installed over 0.1, it needs a fresh install. </p>

<p>The good news about this delay is that 0.2 will be more fully tested (the girlfriend and I use it regularly) before release. </p>

<p>8 October 2008: I had a little more free time than I expected this week and was able to get a lot of work done on 0.2.  So much that I consider the generally functionality to be complete: CHANGELOG.  Now all it needs is some testing (this means you).  There&#39;s still no &#39;upgrade&#39; script, so you can&#39;t just pull down the subversion repository and drop it in-place on your current installation, but the installer is fully updated, so you can install a new, separate copy, and see if you get any bugs.  I&#39;ll hopefully have the upgrade script done by Friday, test over the weekend, and then release 0.2 on Monday.  If things go as planned. </p>

<p>2 October 2008: Work has genuinely begun on 0.2.  You can pull down the source by following directions here.  I&#39;ll continue to work on it as time permits.  Note that no particular SVN commit is considered to be solid, and definitely read the commit notes as they may indicate how sure I am on the reliability of each commit. </p>

<p>If you have any outstanding issues with FeatherChat 0.1, now would be the time to report them.</p>

It is intended to be really usable from a “real production scenario” point of view. This means: </p>

<p>Have a programming interface as small and easy as possible, no matter how complex the internal code is. From a software engineering point of view, the OO structure may not be as correct and clean as it could have been. It is not messy, but several decisions where made that improved performance and simplicity at the cost of breaking some “good OO programming” conventions. Rendering performance is a major concern when designing all the algorythms.</p>

 title : The fieldtrip-project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>BackgroundFieldtrip allows content experts to produce new online e-case studies with limited support from computer and media production specialists. The idea is based on recent developments in web technologies and how people are beginning to use the web. One of the main ideas behind the concept is that of moving away from an Internet in which the majority of users are only consumers of information (read only web), towards a new model in which the majority of users are both consumers and producers of information (read/write web). </p>

<p>HighlightsFieldtrip can be used to create a library of online case studies. Each case study includes a group of events that happened at a specific time, associated with a variety of information resources. </p>

<p>Within the case study, each event has a defined place (on a map) and a time (on a timeline) on which it occurred. The story for each event can be told through a combination of text and media elements (photos, animation, audio or video). In this way, it is possible to construct the geographic and historical context for the case study. </p>

<p>In addition, information resources can also be included to illustrate, expand, put in context or give scientific grounding to the story narrated in each event. The resources can be media, texts and hyperlinks. </p>

<p>User LevelDesigned for students, researchers and educators at the tertiary education level (graduate and post-graduate) and for professionals and practitioners. </p>

<p>The user can either have the script fill the drive until it is full, or copy a specific number of songs.  It also can run mp3gain on the files after copy to normalize the volume.  If desired, it can clear out the flash drive before filling.</p>

 title : The filterling Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Filterling was written to combat the spammers and increasingly prevalent ssh brute force attacks.   </p>

<p>It watches any number of logs for any number of regular expression matches.  Once a configurable threshold is reached, a user defined action occurs, like inserting a filter with pf/iptables.  After a specified amount of time has passed, the filter entry can be removed or some other user defined action can be performed. </p>

<p>You can whitelist IPs, and configure any shell command to execute instead of a filter insert/delete. </p>

<p>There is a pretty web interface (in ruby) that shows all the IPs currently blocked, their country of origin, and their country flag.  You can click on the entry to get a full whois lookup. </p>

<p>An example of the web interface is here: http://randomdynamics.com/filterling </p>

<p>I wrote this in a weekend, and updated the web stuff another day.  It&#39;s a little rough, but has been running great for over a year for me on three boxes.</p>

 title : The flexamfphpcairngormgenerator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Adobe Cairngorm MVC framework is used by many Flex developers to deliver scalable and maintainable rich internet applications.  </p>

<p>This is not the site for the core, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; Adobe Cairngorm. Readers may visit the Adobe Labs for more information about Adobe Cairngorm MVC.  Meanwhile, the Cairngorm Extensions provided here have been open-sourced to help developers address Cairngorm implementation issues commonly encountered within enterprise RIA solutions.  </p>

<p>Extensions for Adobe CairngormThe Cairngorm Extensions are summarized below. Each link will provide details and examples of the specific extension: </p>

<p> Events Built-in support to transport responders for direct view or business logic callbacks. Implementation of AnnounceFaultEvent to allow business logic to centralize error reporting and logging. Implementation of EventGenerator to allow developers to automate dispatching of sequences of events.  Events now should self-dispatch... for direct deliver to the business/controller layer. 2) View Notification 
<br/>Built-in framework support to allow views to using proxy responders to request direct notifications to business events responses.  3) FrontControllers 
<br/>SubControllers are available so modules implemented with sub-MVC and dynamically aggregated and used within a global MVC framework. Improved error checking Ability to easily register a Function callback for any business event 4) Command Implementation 
<br/>Base class implementation Enhancements to support aggregation of event-business logic within a single Command class.  Support for the optional view notifications Best practice to deprecate Command sequencing  5) Delegate Implementation 
<br/>Base class implementation Support for easy queue of delegate calls Improved support for WebService use and WSDL errors Best practice to allow easy data transformations  Best practice to hide multiple server calls 6) ServiceLocator 
<br/>Configure services (RDS) at runtime Configure timeouts of HTTPService and WebService Universal Mind has extended the &quot;classic&quot; Adobe 2.2.x Cairngorm version to provide many productivity and maintenance enhancements. Those extensions have now been open-sourced - with BSD licensing -  to the Flex and Flash developer community. Please note that - for now - the library source code contained here (and compiled into the .swc library) actually includes the source code from the Cairngorm 2.2.1 release. Soon developers will be able to use build options to generate a CairngormExtensions.swc that does not include the core Adobe Cairngorm code. </p>

 summary : <p>NEW AND NOTEWORTHY: Paul Barnes-Hoggett has implemented headless coverage recording with EMMA-style report output using a custom coverage agent -- see http://eyefodder.com/ for details. </p>

<p>If you are having problems, check out the FlexcoverHints page.  You can also look at the Flexcover Discussion Group (see sidebar for link), and it&#39;s a good place to post a question. </p>

<p>This project provides code coverage instrumentation, data collection and reporting tools for Adobe Flex and AIR applications. </p>

<p>Flexcover is a code coverage tool for Flex, AIR and AS3.  It incorporates a modified version of the AS3 compiler which inserts extra function calls in the code within the SWF or SWC output file. At runtime, these function calls send information on the application&#39;s code coverage to a separate tool;  The modified compiler also emits a separate &quot;coverage metadata&quot; file that describes all the possible packages, classes, functions, code blocks and lines in the code, as well as the names of the associated source code files. </p>

<p>Flexcover now computes both line coverage and branch coverage.  In branch coverage conditional code paths rather than lines are counted.  Many developers feel that branch coverage is a much more accurate measure of coverage, and it is able to detect coverage issues that occur within a single line of code such as compound conditionals with || and &amp;&amp;, or conditional expressions using the ?: operator. </p>

<p>The corresponding SDK modifications can be found in the flexcover-sdk project on Google Code. </p>

 title : The flexedtoolkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Flexed toolkit is a set of simple components that can be easily re-used :) When I started working on Flex in 2006, I was really impressed by the framework. I have been using Flex in the project that I am working on presently. And one our goals was to build as many re-usable components so that the developers in the team do not end up re-inventing the wheel everyday. Also, its easy to deal with custom components from a maintenance perspective. </p>

<p>In this process, we learnt a lot from the community, discussion boards, mailing groups and other bloggers. flexedtoolkit is more of an effort to give it back to the community, share the knowledge we have gained and more importantly help other developers around the world save time by using the flextoolkit widgets/utilities. </p>

 title : The flexible-js-formatting Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project consists of two libraries that dynamically build a formatting function for number and date formatting.  The date formatting is very similar to PHP&#39;s functionality; it also permits parsing dates.  The number formatting is similar to MS Excel formatting.  The technique of building a function to implement each formatting instruction leads to cleaner code that is richer in functionality and much faster than other popular libraries, as proven by benchmarks. </p>

<p>There is also a date chooser application (aka calendar form control) that uses the functionality provided by these libraries.  And there&#39;s a JavaScript combo box and HTML input mask. </p>

<p>The code was originally developed and hosted on http://www.xaprb.com/ but is now being hosted here so all can contribute to it.  It is now licensed under the MIT license, not the LGPL as it originally was. </p>

<p>All are invited to contribute; the original developer is very short on time, so if you want something done, please just do it yourself and don&#39;t wait for others.  Anyone who requests commit access to the Subversion repository will be granted.  Email baron.schwartz at gmail.com to request commit access. </p>

<p>Lightweight but rich data grid with resizable columns and a scrolling data to match the headers, plus an ability to connect to an xml based data source using Ajax to load the content. </p>

<p>Similar in concept with the Ext Grid only its pure jQuery love, which makes it light weight and follows the jQuery mantra of running with the least amount of configuration. </p>

<p>Features </p>

New preProcess API, allows you to modify or process data sent by server before passing it to Flexigrid, allowing you to use your own JSON format for example. Single Rows Select just use { singleSelect: true } in the options Quick Search Many more I&#39;m planning to add an Editable and Resortable rows feature, as well as other cool GUI features. One of my main goal for the plugin is ultimately to keep it lightweight, maybe under 20k when compressed. Because otherwise you should probably stick with Ext Grid or YUI data table.</p>

 summary : <p>FlexMVCS is an application framework for developing Flex and ActionScript 3 projects. This is a Flex-focused modification of the excellent PureMVC framework. A significant design influence was Joe Berkovitz&#39;s MVCS approach. </p>

<p>FlexMVCS was designed and implemented by Ali Mills and Luke Bayes of Pattern Park, Inc. and was entirely funded and generously contributed to the community by Bunchball, Inc. </p>

<p>This build differs from PureMVC in the following ways: </p>

<p>Removed unnecessary use of Singletons. Added IService as a first-class participant and member of IFacade. Created asynchronous commands that trigger events when complete. Added composite command that facilitates synchronous and asynchronous command chaining with support for arbitrary composition depth. Added MXML Facade definitions. Application Facades can be defined using MXML instead of only ActionScript. Added support for Modular Flex applications, including composite Facades for each loaded module. PureMVC is trying to be more than we need, we need clean, intuitive support for Flex and ActionScript. Not ECMA, Java or other languages.

 title : The flexundoredo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Flex UndoRedo FrameworkWe at Soph-Ware Associates would like to announce the first release of the Flex UndoRedo Framework. The Flex UndoRedo Framework provides all the facilities that you need for implementing undo and redo within your applications. </p>

<p>The Flex UndoRedo Framework was built with the following goals in mind: </p>

<p>Provide a robust, extensible framework that would work without modification for basic needs Support for different groups of undo events (one group per flexMdi window for example) Allow undo and redo of an unlimited number of events Integrate cleanly and transparently into applications with or without Cairngorm The Flex UndoRedo Framework is an open source project available for all to use. For more information, please see the links in the sidebar. </p>

<p>With CairngormThe Cairngorm release builds provides a lightweight but extensible framework for handling undo and redo. </p>

<p>As we have now been through a few iterations with the undo framework, we believe that it provides a solid 1.0 release. If you have thoughts or suggestions, we would love to hear about them. </p>

<p>Without CairngormWe have recently created a fork of the UndoRedo Framework that does NOT use Cairngorm.  Rather, it provides the same undo stack and undo group facilities but uses a different base class and a separate (but identical) interface so that it can easily be integrated into non-Cairngorm projects. </p>

<p>You can download the most recent version of the Flex UndoRedo Framework not requiring Cairngorm from the downloads area or the featured downloads sidebar. </p>

<p>Commercial FriendlyAlthough we started out with a GPL license, we&#39;ve changed our license to the Apache License in order to be friendly to our commercial users.  A sincere thank you to everyone who requested this change. </p>

 title : The flexxb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FlexXB is an open source library for Adobe Flex/Air applications that provides annotation based marshalling/un-marshalling of Flash objects in order to facilitate data communication between Flex UI and backend servers or to process various content. It offers a built-in xml handling mechanism.</p>

<p>FlexXB is now serialization format agnostic and allows users to extend the engine and add support for different serialization formats (JSON, etc) while still sharing the base features such as object caching, circular reference handling, constructor annotations, id fields, version extraction. The advantage is that the base features are integrated by default with the new serialization context that defines the new format and one should only care about the actual AS3 object - ? conversions.</p>

 title : The flint-cms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Flint: a simple Grok-based CMSFlint is a pragmatic and light-weight CMS based on Grok which is useful out-of-the-box, allows trivial customizations to be done trivially, but showcases Grok best practices and therefore leverages the flexibility and pluggability of the Zope Component Architecture to allow deep customization and extension.  </p>

<p>In order to be immediately useful, Flint follows the Plone lead by providing ready to use content management and public interfaces. However, Flint&#39;s content management interface is not embedded in the public interface, for two reasons: to make it easier to customize one interface without touching the other, and to avoid a single-hierarchy mindset which is detrimental to current content management best practices. </p>

<p>Besides Plone, Flint is inspired by three other pragmatic and light-weight CMSs which aim for flexibility while remaining easy to learn: Radiant (Ruby on Rails, see http://radiantcms.org/), Página-1 (a pre-CMF Zope Based CMS developed by Hiperlógica), and  Django, which although is not a CMS comes quite close with it&#39;s powerful and ready to use admin interface.  </p>

 title : The flisp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SWF files commonly consume XML in order to define their data at runtime; however, algorithms are almost always baked into the Actionscript code at compile time and leave the coder no options at runtime.</p>

<p>Flisp classes, when compiled into a Flash project, will allow that project to optionally pull in strings of Scheme code at runtime and have them execute either once or as part of a clip&#39;s onEnterFrame function. Thus, the XML can contain not only static pieces of data such as &#39;starting_y=&quot;122&quot;&#39; but also algorithmic information like &#39;enterFrameLisp=&quot;(+ _y 1)&quot;&#39;, all as attributes within an XML node.</p>

<p>Lisp is chosen for the pure simplicity of its syntax, which among other things makes it possible to parse quickly into trees of objects. Also, in all honesty I&#39;m working my way through the MIT Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs course and view this as a chance to develop in two directions at once.</p>

<p>However, first and foremost it&#39;s born of necessity: I&#39;m making a game engine that creates all its entities from XML nodes, and don&#39;t want to subclass every time I need a slightly different movement algorithm.</p>

 title : The fluentjava Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>News11/05/2009: fluentjava 0.3 Released. </p>

<p>The whole EnumerationProtocol was implemented, as you can see here, with a little closure coercion as well. Fluent Sets, Fluent Maps and Fluent lists can be easily be created from other collections libraries. Lazy methods on enumeration protocol, so that you can cascade, filter, map, take and only invoke the actual closures when you actually need the result. And much more. </p>

<p>Get started here. </p>

<p>IntroductionProject that attempts to reduce the verbosity, lack of fluency and unfriendly interface that is common to several tasks in Java, such as: </p>

<p>Blocks of code manipulation (Closures) Collection manipulation Reflection Input/Output Raw Type conversion Next few StepsReally planned list Deprecated as 14/01/2010 by Mark Reinhold&#39;s assertion that lambda expressions or even full blown closures will be brought to java7. Ok, evidences are (here, here and here): java 7 will very likely not have closures, which made me reconsider adding it to this project, while making it backwards compatible with all the bringing closure to java attempts. Automatic object to Closure coercion is vital to this, and little AOP can make it even more fluent.  New File-like returning reades/writers, streams, and ExtendedIterators for paths and lines of content for simple files/Files for directories (many features are already included on commons-io, but all as top-level functions). Fluent style. Make Files a Composite: File-like structure composed of folders and files. Mirror getting Maps as input/output Mirror being able to convert types like Spring does on its IoC Fluent output. System.out just doesn&#39;t cut. Also use Xstream to allow output of any object in XML format. Generic Decorators that turn any object into Serializable (via Xstream in the generic case) and Comparables (receiving Comparators) Create Order objects, which require only lessThanMethod to be implemented (no more 0, -1 or negative, or +1 or positive that Comparators need). Comparator built from Orders. Inspiration: Python. General ConceptsA few links to clear things up. </p>

<p>Fluent Style and DSLs: http://martinfowler.com/dslwip/ http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html Closures:  Article that introduces closures and its uses, using apache commons:  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-fp.html Martin Fowler&#39;s post on the uses of closures and collections: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CollectionClosureMethod.html No closures in java: http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brucechapman/archive/2008/03/anouncement_no.html Enumerable in ruby: How closures are usefull. Scala also has its own  enumeration protocol. Closures in Smalltalk: where all the oo + functional rage began. Also, they are called blocks here.  Functional java is a project that aims to prepare the Java programming language for the inclusion of closures, and would benefit from java incorporating the BGGA implementation. Groovy also makes good use of it. No need to wait for closures on java to use the project above. It is not pure java though. Fork join javadoc: filter, map, find, etc. Not only are they usefull for expressing, but IBM has made it clear that they work very well with closures, and are great at making common tasks trivally parallel. Unlike closures, this made through the cut into java 7. Similar ProjectsApache Commons (formerly known as Jarkata Commons): similar feature-wise mostly to the features encompassed by commons lang, commons io and commons collections. Jaggregate: great project of Smalltalk-like collections. The project has its downfalls though, such as using Java collections classes names, which can be confusing. Generic algorithmns for java: closure api to Java. Still not as terse as real smtalltalk, python, ruby or scheme&#39;s syntax, but provides quite a few  pre-made closures. Google collections: also provides some closures, not as much as jga. Has several kinds of collections though, and several utility methods on them as well. Hamcrest Collections: very fluent interface for collections. Development is still at the beginning, and uses a lot of Global Scoping technique, which mostly comes from Hamcrest. http://functionalj.sourceforge.net/: Another project that tries to bring functional programming to java world. Yeah google did it a long time ago, and Hadoop did it again. Yes, map and reduce are functional concepts. gparallelizer By using Groovy, it wrapps around Fork-join and make it more usable.</p>

 title : The flyweights Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Flyweights are small handle classes for immutable data that intelligently share their content to prevent memory duplication. The Flyweight class has been designed as simply as possible and can be used as a drop-in replacement for T. </p>

<p>ProblemImagine an application that has hundreds or thousands of users. Each user has a first and last name, stored as separate strings in memory. It is highly likely that some of them share the same first or last names; if there are 20 people with the first name &quot;Richard&quot; then 20 duplicate instances of &quot;Richard&quot; will exist in memory. </p>

<p>SolutionThe best way to demonstrate how Flyweights can address this problem is with a very simple example: </p>

<p>Flyweight a = &quot;Richard&quot;;
<br/>Flyweight b = &quot;Richard&quot;;
<br/>Flyweight c = &quot;Richard&quot;;
<br/>Flyweight d = &quot;Richard&quot;;
<br/>Flyweight e = &quot;Richard&quot;;With regular System.String objects, five separate copies of &quot;Richard&quot; would exist concurrently, even though they are all identical. Flyweights can detect this, and will only store one object in memory. </p>

 title : The fnshortener Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Some MP3 mobile players only show a very limited number of directories when using the FAT16 file system.

<p>fnshortener (file name shortener) will do this job automatically for you. </p>

<p>BIG FAT WARNING: Always double check which path you give as an argument to fnshortener. Every file and directory will be renamed. Even if there is no MP3-file in it at all. This can </p>

<p>destroy your file-system (Windows) destroy the names of your wonderful arranged home-directory (Linux) destroy the wonderful names of your MP3 files in your original MP3 collection. So only rename copies of your MP3 collection. </p>

 title : The foogoo2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The foom Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Foom was designed with a few core ideas.  </p>

<p>·       It must have C-style syntax.  For better or worse, many of today’s programming languages have derived or borrowed aspects of their syntax from C. Doing so decreases the learning curve allowing broader adoption of the language. </p>

<p>·       Everything is an object. Most programming languages have a set of primitive data types such as strings, integers, floating point numbers, and Boolean values.  In Foom, all of these, with the addition of functions and types, are classes. They all have properties that can be accessed and manipulated. </p>

 summary : <p>Tired of forms in your web application getting spammed?  Captcha works but is a pain.  This plugin ensures a real person is submitting the form without requiring anything from the user except that they have Javascript turned on. </p>

<p>This plugin uses the Hivelogic Enkoder, normally used to protect spambots from harvesting e-mail addresses, to enkode a hidden field on the form.  That field is required when the user submits the form or they get an error. </p>

 title : The form-test-helper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>form-test-helper has gone on to a better placeform-test-helper was first released in September of 2006.  At the time, it represented a significant step forward in testing apps with the full rails stack.  I haven&#39;t updated it in quite some time, and I&#39;m happy to see that some other tools came along and built on form-test-helper&#39;s ideas.  Go check out webrat and read The Rspec Book to learn about the latest Rails tools in this vein. -- Jason Garber </p>

<p>--- </p>

<p>This plugin uses assert_select to verify and manipulate your forms.  It solves the problem we&#39;ve all run into where you change the form but the test doesn&#39;t break because you&#39;re just passing parameters to an action.   </p>

<p>Instead of this: post :create, :book =&gt; {:name =&gt; &#39;Pickaxe&#39;, :category =&gt; 1, :out_of_print =&gt; 0} </p>

<p>This plugin lets you do this: </p>

<p>get :new
<br/>submit_form do |form|
<br/>  form.book.name = &#39;Pickaxe&#39;
<br/>  form.book.category = &#39;Programming&#39;
<br/>  form.book.out_of_print.uncheck

 summary : <p>The development of Semantic Web Applications is hard. Meanwhile using Jena, Sesame, or any other Java library to create your first experiments is relatively easy, the next step, building useful Semantic Web Applications is too complex for the average developer. You have to deal with web servers and web-client technologies, and join all this with your application code. </p>

<p>Wiki technologies provide a simple syntax to create the web-client, and some wikis let developers to extend its functionality by means of plugins. </p>

<p>We exploit these plugins to provide developers with a Java library named Fortunata that joins all the best of a concrete wiki (JSPWiki), Jena, and a web server (Apache Tomcat) in order to simplify the creation process of Semantic Web Applications. </p>

 title : The foxify-fixtures-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Foxify Fixtures plugin for Rails(See original blog post: http://edgenic.com/2008/06/11/foxify-fixtures-plugin-refactor-those-old-fixtures-to-make-them-foxy) </p>

<p>Foxify fixtures refactors your Rails application test fixtures by changing all id-based references to name-based references (see http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2007/10/26/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-fixtures-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier). It should work on both regular Test fixtures as well as Rspec  fixtures. </p>

<p>The plugin assumes that various conventions are followed, for instance: </p>

<p>all foreign keys end with &#39;id&#39; class names are the &quot;camelized&quot;, singular form of the table names   Given these assumptions, Foxify fixtures may not work if your models and relationships deviate from the default Rails way of doing things. </p>

<p>One caveat: This plugin only &quot;foxifies&quot; the actual fixture .yml files themselves. If your tests access the fixtures based on ID&#39;s, those will have to be manually refactored to access the fixtures based on names. </p>

<p>UsageAlthough the plugin will try to back up your fixtures into a directory named &#39;backup&#39; where your fixtures are located, it&#39;s a good idea to back up your app  before running the plugin. </p>

<p>Run as follows: </p>

<p>rake db:fixtures:foxify 
<br/>TroubleshootingFoxify fixtures relies upon the associations an app has defined in it&#39;s  models. If an association is missing, for example having a &#39;has_many :books&#39;  association in your Author model, but missing the respective  &#39;belongs_to :author&#39; in your Book model, the you&#39;ll get an error message  telling you what foreign key is missing the association. It&#39;s also possible  that the plugin will incorrectly complain about your associations, if they  don&#39;t follow the default Rails conventions. </p>

 title : The freemium Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FreemiumThe Freemium plugin attempts to encapsulate the Right Way to offer service subscriptions. It is built to handle multiple subscription plans (free, premium, premium plus, etc.), let you control your own invoices, and to interact with any merchant gateway that supports either automated recurring billing or credit card storage. </p>

<p>Freemium is a different beast from ActiveMerchant. Where the latter is optimized for one-off billing of credit cards (as in a retail environment), Freemium is optimized for storage and recurring billing of credit cards. This makes it a much cleaner and more complete solution for handling subscriptions. At the time of this writing, however, Freemium actually depends on ActiveMerchant because of its excellent CreditCard model, which I plan to steal. </p>

<p>This plugin was born out of my attempts to figure out the correct way to handle subscriptions. I decided that the safest/cleanest way was to simply keep track of how far out the subscription had been paid, and when that date came near, bill the subscription again to extend the paid_through date. The approach has turned out well, I think, though I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to review the processes in this plugin to make sure the assumptions it makes are appropriate. </p>

Flexible Licensing -- Flexible GNU Licence.  The customer can change .  You can &#39;Under the hood&#39; visibility -- Any code quality issues or defects are visible unlike non-free, closed source systems.  Unlike with proprietary software, you will be able to audit FreeTMS for security and quality. Goals for First ReleaseModel the petroleum terminal management business in a proper RDBMS (like PostgreSQL). Design interfaces for importing data into our datamodel with concentration on PIDEX, PetroEx, and SAP IDOCs. Develop reports (as views). Design interfaces for hardware meters and load controllers (like Accuload and Multiload). Implement a sriptable loading process using a language like TCL, lisp, or Python. Integrate &#39;pretty&#39; reporting system like Crystal Reports or Jasper Reports. Incorporate graphical user interface (using GTK+). All of this should run under Unix (FreeBSD, Solaris, &amp; Linux) and use the GNU toolchain.  Support for the Sun Studio compiler should be included.</p>

 title : The Fritzing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers and artists to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product. We are aiming to create a software in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, that allows the designer/artist/researcher/hobbyist to document their Arduino-based prototype and create a PCB layout for manufacturing. The complimenting website helps to share and discuss drafts and experiences as well as to reduce manufacturing costs. </p>

<p>Fritzing will essentially be an Electronic Design Automation software with a low entry barrier, suited for the needs of designers and artists. It will use the metaphor of the breadboard, so that it will be easy to transfer your hardware sketch to the software. From there it will be possible to export CAD files ready to be sent to a</p>

 summary : <p>This project teoretically compiles on many platforms (but tested only on WinXP and Debian). It uses STL, OpenGL/GLUT, OpenAL and DevIL (older OpenIL), so, it should run everywhere these libraries are implemented. There are lots of things that need to be built, the current code is very simple and quite reusable. You may copy anything you want.</p>
 title : The frontnote Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FrontNote is designed to be a full office-class note-taking replacement application. Long term goals for FrontNote include: </p>

<p>-A multi-platform GUI (Java) capable of synchronizing with a user&#39;s online note repository. + Automatic synchronization between the user&#39;s computer and the online repository when an internet connection is detected. + SVN/CVS-style version control for individual note sheets. -A web 2.0 (ajax, ruby) interface capable of handling and storing both text and tablet pen input. -Abstract composition of the user&#39;s note repository, allowing for simple scalability (i.e., one note sheet compiled to a multi-user note project). -User friendly note repository sharing features, including access permission considerations. </p>

<p>FrontNote is geared toward a business worker or student who requires on-the-fly access to his/her note repository, usable in any computing situation (text/pen input, online/offline, browser/standalone). FrontNote is designed with usability, speedy data access, and ease of data entry as highest priorities. </p>

<p>FrontNote is free software.</p>
 summary : <p>This project allow programmers to create plugins for Apple&#39;s Front Row 2.0, that was released with OS X 10.5 (Leopard) </p>

<p>Currently, its in a basic stage, only serving as an example of how to create plugins. </p>

<p>The only known working plugin currently is the FrontMyth plugin. The code for this is available in the examples area. </p>

<p>Future plans </p>

<p>Convenience classes to create recursive menus, and other simplifications. possibly support AppleTV. I do not have an AppleTV to test with, but since the py2app stuff seems to place all the support libraries for Python, this may work. I plan on buying an AppleTV in a few months to test, unless someone else takes up the cause. </p>

<p>A big thanks to the Sapphire group, who released their source code, which I heavily based this on.</p>

 title : The frothing Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Frothing (Feed Reading On The Hoof) is a news aggregator for online news feeds. There are many other news readers available, but some are not available for mobile Linux devices or require many extra libraries to be installed. Frothing tries to fill this gap by creating a fast and easy to use news aggregator for mobile Linux handheld devices </p>

<p>InstallationFor now, to install Frothing you need to compile it inside a Hildon compatible desktop environment. To create such an environment have a look at the Moblin site or the Maemo site </p>

<p>Frothing was originally created for the Ubuntu Mobile Guide as an example of how to port an application written in C to the Ubuntu Mobile Edition. This guide is available online here and is good to read for background information. </p>

<p>	 </p>

<p>UME   Maemo        </p>

<p>Compiling from SourceEither check out the source from svn or grab the tarball to compile </p>

<p>The source can be checked out from the repositories by: </p>

<p>svn checkout http://frothing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ frothing </p>

<p>	 The tarball can be downloaded from the project page and extracted by:  </p>

<p>tar zxvf frothing-.tar.gz  
<br/>After unpacking/checking out the code, run the standard autotools commands inside your target:  </p>

<p>./configure --enable-hildon </p>

<p>make </p>

<p>make install		 </p>

<p>DependenciesOn Ubuntu the dependencies can be satisfied by: apt-get install libgtkhtml2-0 libgtkhtml2-dev libxml-perl libxslt1-dev libglade2-0 libglade2-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev libhildondesktop-dev xulrunner  </p>

<p>Maemo NotesThanks to Chris Malley </p>

<p>libgtkhtml2-0 and libgtkhtml2-0-dev are not available (yet?) in the maemo repositories so you need to apt-get the source from debian/ubuntu and build it inside scratchbox with --disable-accessibility  </p>

<p>Also you need to add </p>

<p>AC_CHECK_LIB(gthread-2.0, g_thread_init) </p>

<p>into configure.ac and do a aclocal/autoconf/autoheader/automake  </p>

This project was first started as a joint effort between Frak, Slacker, and Mercury to provide the community with high quality client and server builds. </p>

<p>Tremulous SVN revision this project is based on: SVN 1101 </p>

<p>ioquake3 SVN revision this project is based on: SVN 1514 </p>

<p>Getting startedWhen you first get the client, place it in the following locations. </p>

<p>Windows C:\Program Files\Tremulous and overwrite the current client. </p>

<p>Linux This location can vary, but most often is placed in /usr/local/games/tremulous. OS X /Applications/tremulous-20060625 folder, assuming you downloaded the client from Apple Downloads. After doing so, you may find some things different that you don&#39;t like, but don&#39;t know how to change them. If you have any problems, please check out the F.A.Q. Wiki, if you cannot find an answer to your question there, please contact a project member about your issue. </p>

<p>Community considerationWe will accept any code or ideas that you give us, as long as it agrees with the following rules. </p>

<p>The code or idea has to be within the limitations of our programming ability. The code or idea has to have a definite use, we will not accept silly functions that print &quot;hi im shooting you&quot; into the client. The code or idea cannot be a function to give a player an advantage over others in game, a.k.a. cheats. If the function has the possibility of being a cheat, then its use has to outweigh its cheating capability. If your code or idea agrees with the following, feel free to post an issue of your code of idea. We will most likely add it. </p>

<p>Why?When I first tried the game Tremulous I was pointed to the original TJW backport, I noticed some lacking features that I sometimes required. From there, I looked into how to compile a Tremulous client, and from then on I had added my own code and patches. I then wanted to start a client that gives the community the same options I had, for the ones that either don&#39;t have the skill or time to make their own clients. That is why Frak, Slacker, and me have all agreed to include any code or ideas that can pass the above rules. - Mercury </p>

<p>I have been doing my own client for a while with tw-clientserver  and just wanted a project with VOIP so i didn&#39;t have to type that much :) - Slacker </p>

<p>I&#39;m a feature-friendly person. Anything I create has to be as user friendly as possible, though in this case, its community friendly. Though the TJW client was great, I was excited of an idea that would actively include new bells and whistles. While Slack and Mercury do the under-the-hood work, I sit in the cab, waxing and polishing the inside, waiting to start the engine and sell the car. - Frak </p>

<p>Updating and version identificationCurrent codename: No Release Yet </p>

<p>To check if your client is out dated, follow these steps... </p>

<p>Open your client and press the ~ key(beside the 1, and above the TAB key) to open the console. Look towards the lower right hand corner of your console, look at the word in parenthesis. Compare the word with the one above, if they do not match, please update your client. After updating, your clients codename should match the one above. If not, please notify a project member.</p>

<p>12 December We are happy with gwt release 2.0.0 Upgraded libraries are uploaded also including all minor fixes. Reporters of issues are strongly encouraged to check their issues. And resolve them if fixed. </p>

<p>Sebtember 9, We released version 1.1.0 It includes mainly improvements and support for gwt 1.7. The next release we will try to include multi day support. more on this later. </p>

<p>June 2, We will be processing the issue list this week. I hope that everyone is having patiance with us. Since we are quite busy. If you have any issues but not reported them please post them this week. </p>

<p>April 17, The code on svn is upgraded to 1.6. We switch to the maven plugin from codehouse. This is version 1.0.0. It will be released when we feel it&#39;s working nicely with 1.6 and the listeners have been removed </p>

<p>March 18, </p>

<p>A bit later than promised but this due to the happy fact that my second daughter was borm a bit sooner. She decided not to wait and join the family. Version 0.9.9 is on the download page. Things done for this release: </p>

<p>Removed flextables where possible Improved performance when navigating weeks Cleaned up code. Please note that the of the extra libary this will be the latest version. We feel that is does not add enough value to maintain as a seperate library. We have bugin developing a gwt application frmaework and everything will be moved there. This project will be internal for the foreseable future. The Calander and File widget will be kept seperate and actively maintained. </p>

<p>March already, We will release 0.9.9 this weekend. The release has some mayor improvements in performance and uses no flextable anymore. Futher things that are solved were reported by some of our users. The ow custom moven plugin has been removed from the demo project and now uses the one that can be found on google code. Futher, the ant scripts have been improved. </p>

<p>January 2009. Happy new year everybody. We just release 0.9.8. It also has the Calander now as emul so you can use the java.util.Calander class. </p>

<p>9 November We released the 0.9.7 release and uploaded the libraries. </p>

<p>23 Oktober At the moment we are unable to upload files. We are looking into it and as soon as it works we will upload 0.9.6 which is ready. </p>

<p>14 Sebtember Some changes in the panels for the event panel. Now it&#39;s based on the Rounded corner panel. Looks nice. We also made a first change on how custom sub panel could be implemented. The setup is better and now uses a setbody for building the structure and a repaintPanel for reseting the shown data on the panel. </p>

<p>(It is a different setup so do not update the svn tree unless you want to upgrade your code, It&#39;s not backwar compatible. but will allow for better customisation and also coloring in the future. We are aiming at allowing the stye to be set by the sub panel.)  </p>

<p>9 Sebtember Ant files updated. Thanks to Kami. People wo are using the source code please be aware that the maven setup requires a internal plugin. So please use the ant file. We will try to resolve this issue in the Future. Futher any tips on what documentation is required or wanted most is greatly apprieciated. And controbutions and insights are welcome ofcours. </p>

<p>20 August. Release 0.9.5 with thanks to Loic. This will be the last release for gwt 1.4. From now on all mayor development wil be done with 1.5 in mind. This wil be welcomed by most and not by others.  </p>

<p>22 Juni. </p>

<p>It has been a wile but we released version 0.9.4 and also added some exiting new things. Most important are: </p>

<p>File upload wicket to upload files without needing to use post directly. It works like the google file upload in gmail. It&#39;s real handy. Works with Apache file upload. Date Edit field with date picker. Date picker provided. Next release it will support event indication. Showing by rendered component that an event is present on day. Month select panel that you can embed in application Whole day event are now supported. and manageble Cleaned up css to be more consistent and less to conflict with other libraries. Removing the need for The Interface. The suggestion of Papick was taken to heart and we saw that it would improve usability more than the seperate interface. People now can use any object that is Serializable to use in the Renderer. We upgraded to the new dnd library. It improves some things a lot and we feel the need to keep used technologies up to date as reasonable possible. Further we fixes some bugs. </p>

<p>People who are willing to test we really like your feedback. </p>

<p>18 January. </p>

<p>We are released 0.9.2. </p>

<p>This release holds some changes like seperating the EventData into a seperate library so that ejb back end can be deployed without the complete library included. Futher point will be: </p>

<p>Delete an Event is not allowed (Added an example in the default dialog to show how this should work) Icon used for event timeslot creation (We did some work on the look and feel and hope you will be pleased.) Compile pre built jars with earliest possible JDK ( Source and Target will be set to 1.4) Ant scripts and some basic documentation. Wiki page </p>

<p>All release notes can be found on the wiki pages. </p>

<p>RoadmapAfter that we are open for suggestions. We need to determine a roadmap for future release. So be free to suggest features in the news group. </p>

<p>We had some questions about a commercial version of the library. We have discussed about this but are against it. We are willing to supply support on an hourly basis or maybe under a support contract setup. We want to know what the general opinion is about this. Would such a possiblety make the library more easy to use within your company. </p>

<p>FunCL uses functors which are like functions, only more generalized. Functor syntax is unique, reminiscent of Forth and LISP--but not either. Functors are made up of clauses, each clause is a series of functors which manipulate the stacks and environment of the FunCL virtual machine (FVM). The FunCL VM is implemented in Java, with the internal functors implemented as Java class methods.</p>

 title : The fusecompress Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is FuseCompress?FuseCompress provides a mountable Linux filesystem which transparently compresses its content. </p>

<p>Files stored in this filesystem are compressed on the fly and FUSE allows to create a transparent interface between compressed files and user applications. </p>

<p>FuseCompress supports different compression methods: LZO, gzip, bzip2, and LZMA. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t there a new version?This is the legacy C implementation of FuseCompress (0.9.x tree). It performs slightly less well than the current one implemented in C++ (1.99.x tree), but does not exhibit flaws such as data corruption or files growing larger and larger that make the current code (as of July 17 2008) unusable in a production environment. You can find the new version at Milan Svoboda&#39;s website. Because Milan is concentrating on the new version, I am now maintaining the old tree. </p>

<p>How well does it work?It works well enough that I have trusted it to handle the vast majority of my private data. I am also using it for my $HOME directory, source trees, and I have (with some really evil hacks) succeeded in installing an openSUSE 11.0 system with FuseCompress as its root filesystem. (That, however, is not something you should currently try at home. At least not on a real system.) </p>

<p>LZMA support is experimental. Both the implementation in FuseCompress and the library used by it are not stable yet. Versions 4.999.3 and 4.999.5 of the LZMA library create mutually incompatible streams, for instance. </p>

<p>I am still occasionally fixing slight deviations from the expected behavior of a Unix filesystem. These problems are all minor, but may still cause data loss, depending on how robust your applications are. </p>

<p>FuseCompress now has experimental support for Mac OS X and MacFUSE. </p>

<p>Where to get itPackages for openSUSE Source code can be found in the SVN repository. More informationBuild HOWTO How to use FuseCompress What compression method should I use?</p>
 summary : <p>Fusemetrics takes the .xml output from PMD, CPD, JUnit, JDepend, FindBugs, Clover, Cobertura and several other metrics/analysis tools, and creates a unified dashboard view of the top level metrics.  In addition, it &quot;remembers&quot; how these values change over time and creates sparkline graphs to see the ongoing evolution of the overall project metrics.  Lastly, where available, it analyzes the metrics across the complete set of classes and packages, and creates various histograms describing the overall class/package population, in terms of size, complexity, coverage, etc.  </p>

<p>Fusemetrics is written in Groovy, and uses Nu.Xom and JFreeChart to assist in processing the xml and generating the charts.</p>

 title : The fuzzyclock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewA blatant rip-off of the KDE source code with tips picked up from here. This code injects a DLL (FuzzyHook.dll) into the WndProc of TrayClockWClass to replace the standard numeric text with fuzzy text. The code also places a clock icon (taken from Crystal SVG; thanks Everaldo!) in the system tray. Right-click on the icon to exit the program. </p>

<p>RequirementsMicrosoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) (for 32-bit platforms) Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64) (for 64-bit platforms) If a configuration error dialog is displayed when launching FuzzyClock, install the corresponding redistributable package. </p>

<p>InstallationExtract FuzzyClock.zip to a folder of your choosing (i.e. x:\Program Files\FuzzyClock). The default language is English. Additional languages can be found within Localizations.zip.  Drag and drop a localization file onto the icon representing FuzzyClock.exe and that localization will be used.  The localization file is stored in %APPDATA%\FuzzyClock as FuzzyClock.xml. In Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003, %APPDATA% is located at x:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data In Windows Vista, %APPDATA% is located at x:\Users\\AppData\Roaming To start FuzzyClock with Windows, create a shortcut for FuzzyClock.exe and place it in %STARTMENU%\Programs\Startup. In Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003, %STARTMENU% is located at x:\Documents and Settings\\Start Menu In Windows Vista, %STARTMENU% is located at x:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu UseRight-click (or double-click) on FuzzyClock tray icon to exit program. Click on FuzzyClock tray icon to toggle between fuzzy and precise times. CreditsAlmost the entirety of the translations is from KDE source code. A few words were grabbed from Microsoft Terminology Translations. </p>

<p>DetailsBuilt using Visual Studio 2005 SP1 (x86 build) and Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (x64 build).  Tested on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.  According to Softpedia, this should work on Win2K and Vista, too.</p>

 title : The fxt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FXT implements client side templating using Model-View-Controller. FXT provides a simple, productive, and compatibile way to deliver rich websites using Adobe Flex.</p>

<p>Model == XML embedded into HTML
<br/>View/Controller == Flex SWF File</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Model Driven – The data (Model) is in HTML as XML. It is browser and search engine compatible.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Restful URLS – The urls are simple, bookmarkable, and back button supported.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Classic MVC - Model is XML embedded in HTML, View and Controller are Flex-generated SWFs.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- E4X is used to render data within the template SWF file.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Model driven use of Flex &#39;states&#39; are supported.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Rapid– Just open a project, edit the XML model, and edit the Flex template to create an interactive site. Layout is component based and easy with E4X.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;- Fast – Once the SWF file is cached, each page load time is 100% data loading and Flex instantiation.</p>

With a single configuration change (it can be completed within 30 seconds), your unit tests can be run in the real GAE app server environment using a web browser. </p>

<p>GAEUnit is simple. It contains only one file: gaeunit.py. Just copy that file into your application directory and add the test URL to app.yaml. </p>

<p>Usage </p>

<p>1. Configure the environment: </p>

<p>Copy gaeunit.py to the project directory. Add the following 2 lines to app.yaml: </p>

<p>- url: /test.*
<br/>  script: gaeunit.py2. Write your test case scripts in Python modules, each containing unittest.TestCase subclasses, in the &#39;test&#39; directory and launch dev_appserver.py </p>

<p>3. Browse to the following URL (change the port if necessary): </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080/testYour test results will be displayed in the browser: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you wish to run a single module, execute it like this: </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080/test?name=my_test_moduleYou can also specify a single test class, like name=my_test_module.MyTestCase or even a single test method, like name=my_test_module.MyTestCase.test_stuff </p>

 summary : <p>GCore (for Game-Core) is my personal lib shared between my game projects (currently made on spare time). This is a C++ lib that gather classes useful to build the core organization of a game.  </p>

<p>Currently it is only tested on Windows XP but I&#39;d like it to be cross-platform (for at least Windows/Linux/Unix/MacOS and maybe Haiku too). It should be thread-safe too as there is no static data nor any singleton class. The user can use the singleton class provided to specify witch class should be a singleton. </p>

<p>This lib is useful when you want to build a game from scratch with other libs (like Ogre + RakNet + OIS + OPCode etc) as it provide some useful (and optional) basic systems often required in a game (like a console system, a log system etc). </p>

<p>The only dependency is boost (http://www.boost.org/) 1.42 at least. </p>

 title : The garbagetruck Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome!Have you ever forget to take out the garbage? </p>

<p>IntroductionGarbageTruck is a c# library that works among other libraries (add-ins) to handle recurrent date/time events. </p>

<p>A temporal expression is the basic element to describe a recurrent event. The most common example of a recurrent event is the days the garbage truck come to pick the garbage up. In my case I have to take out the garbage every Wednesday night but that can be vary depending on holidays and so on.  </p>

<p>So what is the information that can be get from a temporal expression about a recurrent event? This project is focused on:  </p>

<p>to determinate if a single date/time is part of the event and  when will the event occur again from a given date/time. </p>

<p>There are infinite imaginable recurrent events and its importance depend on the application they are going to be applied, so try to build a complex library to describe them all is not a good idea. This project is based on that premise. </p>

<p>GarbageTruck allows to handle and persist single and related temporal expressions that are build separately in order to gain simplicity and flexibility. </p>

<p>For more information about recurrent events, temporal expressions and the patterns which this project is based on please read Martin Fowler, Recurring Events for Calendars article that can be found in the downloads section of this site. </p>

<p>Help usYour collaboration is very important to improve this project since it requires continuous improvement a test.  Performance and accuracy are the key of the successful since there are events that can occur even in nanoseconds. </p>

<p>You can help the way you want to this project but there three main aspects that need to be covered: </p>

<p>Development </p>

<p>There&#39;s no words wrote in stone here.  </p>

<p>Project structure needs to be reviewed to see if there are a better approach to handle temporal expressions. Current temporal expressions need to be reviewed to see if there&#39;s a way to improve their code. New temporal expressions need to be created to increase the scope of recurrent events. Demo applications needs to be created to help people to understand the use of the libraries. For more information about development procedures and tasks see the development page of the wiki. </p>

<p>Quality assurance </p>

<p>To ensure that a temporal expression works as it should is not a simple task, so... </p>

<p>Test cases need to be figured and implanted. Those test cases should be executed. For more information about development procedures and tasks see the Quality assurance page of the wiki. </p>

<p>Documentation </p>

<p>A library must be understandable for the people that needs to use it, code comments are not enough, library reference and tutorials need to be created as well. </p>

<p>For more information about development procedures and tasks see the documentation page of the wiki. </p>

<p>How to join?If you are interested in participate of the project just send an email to the any of the administrators telling how you can collaborate.  There&#39;s no mailing list at this point. </p>

<p>Issues are going to be created to solve specif needs of the project.  Once you be a member you can pick any of the open issues and start working on them. </p>

<p>GarbageTruck is in an initial stage and lots of things need to be done, be free to add issues you think must be covered and let us know any suggestion or comment about the project.</p>
 summary : <p>This plugin for the SportTracks software is meant to replace part of Garmin Training Center (GTC).  As such, this plugin allows you to create and edit the advanced workouts and profiles that can then be sent to fitness units.  Even though this is meant to replace GTC you will find a better integration with SportTracks via the usage of SportTracks categories.  This plugin also implements the latest units targets such as power and some user friendly features like drag &amp; droping, copy-pasting and more. </p>

<p>The latest version can be downloaded from here </p>

<p>Installation instructionsDownload the latest version on your hard drive. Once the download has completed, open the .st2plugin file If you have a version already installed in SportTracks you should uninstall the current version prior to installing a new one with the above method.  You can also simply update directly from the Plugins section of the SportTracks Settings page. </p>

<p>Important NotesThis version of the plugin requires the latest version of SportTracks, which is 2.1.3478 or later The Garmin Communicator Plugin must be installed and activated in Internet Explorer.  After it has installed, go to the test page in Internet Explorer and allow the ActiveX plugin. Once this is done, your unit should be detected on the test page. The &quot;export to device&quot; feature won&#39;t work on Vista x64 (and possibly XP x64, I need a confirmation on this)  Please consider donating if you like this plugin.For some help on how to use the plugin and the features it offers, please visit the wiki. </p>

<p>If you would like to report a bug, add a feature request or make a comment about the plugin, head to the issues page. </p>

<p>Feel like contributing?  There are some features that need programming and some translations are still missing.  Contact me via the official plugin&#39;s thread (http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks/Forums/viewtopic.php?t=4702) or via a PM to PissedOffCil.</p>

<br/>    @chart.data = data Notice: title is now an array instead of string </p>

<p>6. ok now, let&#39;s add more data    dataset1 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [10,50,4,10,16]
<br/>    dataset2 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [99, 81, 25, 54, 80]

<br/>    @chart.data = data </p>

<p>7. hmmmm, let&#39;s put some colors    dataset1 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [10,50,4,10,16], :color =&gt; &#39;FF0000&#39;
<br/>    dataset2 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [99, 81, 25, 54, 80], :color =&gt; &#39;0000FF&#39;

<br/>    @chart.data = data </p>

<p>8. better but not good enough, which one is java which one is ruby, let&#39;s put the legend    dataset1 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [10,50,4,10,16], :color =&gt; &#39;FF0000&#39;, :title =&gt; &#39;Java&#39;

<br/>    @chart.data = data </p>

<p>9. now, it will be nice to have axis    dataset1 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [10,50,4,10,16], :color =&gt; &#39;FF0000&#39;, :title =&gt; &#39;Java&#39;

<br/>    @chart.data = data
<br/>    @chart.axis = axis </p>

<p>10. and two more, right and second x axis    dataset1 = GoogleChartDataset.new :data =&gt; [10,50,4,10,16], :color =&gt; &#39;FF0000&#39;, :title =&gt; &#39;Java&#39;

 summary : <p>(gcalcli) Google Calendar Command Line Interfacegcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google Calendar from a command line.  It&#39;s easy to get your agenda, search for events, and quickly add new events.  Additionally gcalcli can be used as a reminder service to execute any application you want. </p>

 title : The gchart Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Warning: Con artists have likely gained admin access to the Client-side GChart project. Consequently, John Curtis Gunther is no longer administering this Google code project, or using the johncurtisgunther Google account. </p>

<p>On two occasions, I have deleted the same inappropriate attachments posted on the GChart issue tracker only to find that these attachments were undeleted without any further action on my part.  </p>

<p>Since only johncurtisgunther (the GChart project admin) can undelete attachments, the simplest explanation for these events is that con artists have obtained the johncurtisgunther Google account password.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a fool-proof way to assure, beyond reasonable doubt, that unknown, possibly bad-acting, persons will not have inappropriate access to the GChart project going forward (I did change passwords, but Google accounts are complex, and my knowledge of them limited, so I cannot be sure the intruders don&#39;t still have some sort of back door). </p>

<p>So I&#39;ve decided to just make a clean break: disavowing/abandoning my own project and Google account. Specifically, I no longer have any association with, and will make no updates, releases, posts or emails from, the GChart project located at http://gchart.googlecode.com, the google id johncurtisgunther@gmail.com, and the yahoo id johncurtisgunther@yahoo.com.  </p>

<p>In light of this experience, I&#39;d urge anyone releasing a project on Google Code to have a rock-solid plan for assuring that others cannot access your Google account password. And if that plan does not consider the scenario of a drive-by download triggered by visiting a link posted on your project&#39;s issue tracker, it still needs some work. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

 summary : <p>This project is NOT actively maintained (and frankly, barely works...)The code may help you on your way, but it&#39;s not even close workable out of the box... sorry!PHP Object wrapper for the Google Chart APIA simple PHP Object wrapper for the Google Chart API. Should help anyone who needs to automate the building of the Google Chart url. Supports all types of charts.  </p>

<p>Get the code here: code link </p>

<p>Pie Chart Example </p>

<p>pie chart using the gPieChart class. </p>

<p>code: </p>

<p>$piChart = new gPieChart;
<br/>$piChart-&gt;addDataSet(array(112,315,66,40));
<br/>$piChart-&gt;valueLabels = array(&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;,&quot;fourth&quot;);
<br/>$piChart-&gt;dataColors = array(&quot;ff3344&quot;, &quot;11ff11&quot;, &quot;22aacc&quot;, &quot;3333aa&quot;);
<br/>Check out the Examples  </p>

<p>NotesLimitations as it currently sits: no support for lxy, or scatter-plots. lxy and scatter should be available soon…  scaling is in place, but kinda useless until I get axes marked correctly. That’s tops on my priority list for this. Some extras still need implementation (chart background, image background, data point markers, etc.) I am pleased with how the code is shaping up. I haven’t had much of an opportunity in the past to play with inheritence and polymorphism in PHP. </p>

<p>Currently I have it set up where like so (in terms of inheritence): </p>

<p>gChart (the base chart class)  gPieChart (has a simple set3D(bool) function) gLineChart gBarChart gStackedBarChart gGroupedBarChart I will probably refactor that sometime soon. But, I’m happy with how it works currently. </p>

<p>I was concerned for a bit about how I would be losing the ability to change the chart type with one line of code (as I could did with the first draft) by breaking chart types out into separate classes. The fact of the matter is that really, no one is very likely to be doing that anyway. So, better code at (perhaps) the sake of some usability…</p>
 title : The gchartrb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introductiongchartrb is a Ruby wrapper around the Google chart API located at http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ </p>

<p>It provides a nice object oriented interface with friendly names, and methods to populate data. Then the data is automatically encoded and the URL can be generated. </p>

<p>Features in the new release of Google Charts API are pending and should be implemented soon. Check out TodoList for a complete list. </p>

<p>Download and InstallationThe simplest way to install gchartrb is via Rubygems </p>

<p>gem install gchartrbAlternatively you can download the latest packages from the Download Page. Run/View the lib/test.rb file to get started. </p>

<p>DocumentationA comprehensive README along with the API docs are located http://gchartrb.rubyforge.org </p>

<p>You can also look at the lib/test.rb (link) and lib/example.rb (link) in the package for a comprehensive set of examples. </p>

<p>Another source is the gchartrb entries on Deepak&#39;s blog </p>

<p>Changes May 21 2008  </p>

<p>latest commit on github contains a new test.rb file which gives an indication of how things are going to change in the next release, syntaxwise. Docs are still pending. </p>

 summary : <p>gcheckyGchecky is a library written in python for using Google Checkout Level 2 Integration XML API. It makes it easy to integrate your order processing system with Google Checkout and ensure that all the interactions with checkout servers are automatically validated, converted from python values to XML (and back) and checked for errors - all that is done by gchecky underneath. </p>

<p>With gchecky an order creation is as easy as writing: </p>

<p>gchecky.model import *
<br/>cart = controller.prepare_order(
<br/>  order = checkout_shopping_cart_t(
<br/>    shopping_cart=shopping_cart_t(
<br/>      items = [item_t(
<br/>          name=&#39;Tom photo&#39;,
<br/>          description=&#39;A beautiful photo of my cat Tom&#39;,
<br/>          unit_price=price_t(
<br/>            value=.99,
<br/>            currency=&#39;USD&#39;),
<br/>          quantity=1)],)))
<br/>print cart.html()Order notification processing is as easy. In your code you manipulate python objects, which mimic Google Checkout XML API messages. Gchecky does all the necessary validation and conversion to/from XML on the fly. </p>

<p>Demohttp://demo.gchecky.com/ is a demo django project that demonstrates the usage of gchecky. Source code of the demo is one of gchecky samples. </p>

<p>DocumentationProject documentation is generated from inline docs in the source code. </p>

<p>Current statusA version 0.2 will soon see the light. It will contain a working django project with samples for three type of GC usage: </p>

<p>digital content donations normal items internet shop yet to be completed All three have custom order processing system - a simple one. It will demonstrate the usage of gchecky.</p>

 summary : <p>PubTools is a simple collection of JavaScript files that make it easy for content authors to work with Gears without having to delve into  JavaScript themselves. PubTools includes two different libraries and features: </p>

<p>- PubTools Search - A JavaScript library that drops a client-side search engine into your page. You configure it with basic HTML + a list of URLs  to index, and a search form that uses the local Gears full-text search abilities will appear in your page to quickly locally search over the documents in real time as a user types into the search field. </p>

<p>- PubTools Offline - A simple JavaScript library that makes it easy to take static content offline using just basic HTML added to your page, along with  a utility bookmarklet for developers to quickly generate Gears manifest files  for a given web page. </p>

<p>Please note that PubTools is not an official Google project or Gears API; it is a project  Brad Neuberg created on his own to teach and help developers. The Gears team does not support this project. However, email Brad if you have questions, concerns, or patches while working with the code.</p>

 summary : <p>This project plugs Google Gears in Ruby on Rails. </p>

<p>Gears on Rails helps developers to write fully offline functionnal web applications based on Gears without learning a bit of Gears. </p>

<p>Here we provide an demo to show what we have got and illustrate our ideas. </p>

<p>In this page, I am going to show how to make an offline read-only application using GoR Plugin. </p>

<p>In order to use this Plugin, Json should be installed on the system.  </p>

<p>     gem install json_pure
<br/>We need Goolge Gears also installed on your system. You would be prompted to install Google Gears when you first time vist this web application if you havn&#39;t install it. </p>

<p>Now I am playing as a Rails programmer, who wants to make an offline version web app but without how to do this in javascript and havn&#39;t heard of Google Gears. </p>

<p>1. Setup a Rails project and Install Plugin     rails demo
<br/>     ruby script/plugin install http://gearsonrails.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/acts_as_local/1.1 Config the database.yml properly  </p>

<p>2. Generate Controller and Edit Viewscript/generate controller say hello 
<br/>In hello.html.erb in the View folder. </p>

<br/>               
<br/>                    &amp;lt;%= link_to_local &quot;SaySomething&quot;, :update=&gt;&#39;result&#39;, :action=&gt;&#39;saysomething&#39;%&gt;

<br/>               
<br/>          
<br/>     
<br/>Notes: In order to use &#39;online_status_tag&#39; and &#39;link_to_local&#39; helpers, you must add   in </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>You can add online_status_tag multiple times to the places you need.  gears_status_tag is used to indicate the current offline app status. </p>

<p>3. Edit Controller and add local controllerIn app/controller/say_controller.rb add </p>

<p>     acts_as_localthen add action &#39;saysomething&#39; </p>

<p>  def saysomething
<br/>    render :text=&gt;Time.now
<br/>  endIn app/controller, make subfolder &#39;local&#39; and add file &#39;say_controller.json&#39; </p>

<p>Note that all offline actions in &#39;say&#39; controller are stored in this file in valid json format as &quot;action_name&quot;:&quot;code&quot; </p>

<p>Add saysomething offline version in say_controller.json </p>

<p>     {
<br/>     &quot;saysomething&quot;: &quot;return (&#39;blabla...&#39;);&quot;	
<br/>     }
<br/>4. Done! Start Servervisit: http://localhost:3000/say/hello </p>

<p>The default offline view is the static page of each view.  However, once you define the corresponding local action in json file, the offline response would be the return value of that local action.  If you either don&#39;t want stale pages of your views or write javascript actions, you could simply write like this: </p>

<p>     acts_as_local :except=&gt;[&#39;hello&#39;]Visitors can&#39;t vist these excluded pages when they are offline.  </p>

<p>You can exclude more actions like </p>

<p>     acts_as_local :except=&gt;[&#39;hello&#39;,&#39;aaa&#39;,&#39;bbb&#39;]Not working? </p>

<p>Change TARGET in  vendor/plugins/acts_as_local/lib/gor/javascripts/data_switch.js to your host </p>

<p>The following will show how to create an offline view of a message board application. </p>

<p>Quick Start for Message BoardUse the 4 easy steps to convert your web-application to an offline working web-application. </p>

<p>Step 0 - Installation of GoR Plugin.Install GoR from Googlecode. Inorder to install GoR from google code run the following command : </p>

<p>ruby script /plugin install http://gearsonrails.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/acts_as_local </p>

<p>Step1 - Create offline actions by editing the controllerAfter installing GoR edit the controller to create the offline actions. Make the following changes to the controller. </p>

<p>1.1)add  acts_as_local at the start of the controller. </p>

<p>1.2)Define a new Local action in the controller.  It is important to include the single inverted comma &#39;. Add the following code to the controller. </p>

<p>def new_local
<br/>	&#39;
<br/>		 posts = Post.find_local(&quot;all&quot;);
<br/>	&#39;
<br/>end1.3)Define create_local action. It is important to include the single inverted comma &#39;. Add the following code to the controller. </p>

<p> def create_local
<br/>	&#39;
<br/>        post = Post.build(params(&quot;post&quot;));
<br/>         Post.create_local(post);
<br/>        window.location.reload( false );
<br/>        &#39;
<br/>   endStep 2 -  Debug InformationEdit view to create offline view. </p>

<p>Add debug info to online view  </p>

<p> Debug info: Online:  
<br/> Gears:  </p>

<p>Create a new html.erb file and copy the contents from the online view as it is to make the offline template. </p>

<p>Step 3.Edit View to create offline view.After offline view is created replace following Ruby functional part   </p>

<p>

<p>Why did you create a separate distribution of the GWT-User library?</p>

<p>Answer:
<br/># There were a number of defects within the library that needed to fixed. These defects were show stoppers for my project&#39;s release plans
<br/># I needed to open the library up more to be able to leverage it and solve the problems that I faced. The user library in its current form was too closed. This is not a critism of the GWT engineering effort, this happens to all frameworks and will happen to the Gems framework too
<br/># I didn&#39;t like the idea of a platform specific distribution in order to do a compile. Only the shell suffers from platform issues, the compiler is free of them
<br/># I didn&#39;t like bundling a fat user lib binary into my war/web application when all I needed was the rpc subsystem.</p>

<p>Abstraction-Based Genetic Programming (ABGP)ABGP is a genetic programming system in which the genotype search space is partitioned by the proofs to which each program is linked to via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. The proofs act as species for organsims by specifying a pattern in which typed genes can be plugged in. Organisms are arrangements of gene as specified by the species to which they belong. Each gene is a closed computational block that may be combined with other blocks to form an organism.    </p>

 title : The genedex Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A simple library to store and query genomic features and sequence.   Find neighbors of a given feature up or downstream, or on a given strand.   Use a feature to slice out sequence from an associated fasta file. </p>

<p>Genedex uses numpy memmaped arrays for fasta slicing of fasta files without creating an new (often very large) sequence file. Instead, it creates a .gdx which is a pickled dictionary where the keys are the headers and the values are the start, stop positions of the sequence in the fasta file. </p>

<p>To do fast feature queries, genedex uses rtree. This does nearest neighbor and overlap queries very efficiently. This requires a  n install of spatialindex as described here </p>

<p>Read the HTML documentation here: http://genedex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/readme.html </p>

 title : The genoa Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Genoa is a open source project management system that focuses on both the initial development of multiple software projects as well as the long-term maintenance of multiple software projects. </p>

<p>Many project management systems today have one of two focuses: </p>

<p> Start - Finish project management - Managing a project with a definite start and end date with no accounting for long-term maintenance of that project. (e.g. Microsoft Project, Basecamp to a degree)  Single Project Tracking - Managing a single project for the life of the project (initial release as well as future releases).  (e.g. Trac) Often times there is a need to both track a project for the original release as well as subsequent maintenance and future releases, without having to create a completely new project (versioning).  You may also be working on more than one release at a time, or have a number of projects you need to track at one time. </p>

<p>The Genoa ApproachThere are a number of projects that need to be tracked. There are releases of a project (aka: versions). a project has a number of goals which are associated with a release each goal may have any number of tasks which are created by the developer assigned to that goal There are a number of addition actions associated with each of these primary points.  For example: </p>

<p>releases can have a date associated with the release goals can be categorized and prioritized tasks are for the users benefit, not the project tracking as a whole users can provide estimates for how long a goal will take to complete goals can move to different releases as needed and more... The functionality of each component and the system as a whole will be documented in the project wiki, and in the future I would like to add features such as subversion integration, calendar integration and more. </p>

<p>I welcome any feedback and anyone interested in assisting.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a port of Genesis Plus, an open-source &amp; portable Sega Mega Drive / Genesis emulator, originally developed by Charles MacDonald, now running on the Gamecube and Wii through libogc &amp; devkitpro. </p>

<p>Please note that this project is actually more than a simple port and the original core has been slightly modified: with respect to the initial goals, I focused myself on improving the emulator accuracy &amp; compatibility, as well as implementing new useful features and adding support for new peripherals and cartridges hardware. </p>

<p>The result is that Genesis Plus is now extremely close to the real thing, can run the entire Sega Genesis / Mega Drive game library and has nothing to envy to the most popular emulators on the PC platform. </p>

<p>The generic (multi-platform) code is maintained through the SVN repository so that other Genesis Plus ports can take advantage of it, and I hope this emulator can become a reference for open-source and accurate Genesis emulation. </p>

<p>Please read the Wiki or the included User Manual for more informations. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For optimal experience, I&#39;d recommend using these Genesis/SMS adapters made by Raphnet technologies. </p>

<p> If you like this project and would like to support it, you may donate via Paypal. All founds donated will be used to help further development by purchasing equipments such as additional controllers, debugging tools or Genesis development cartridge to run test on real hardware and improve emulator accuracy.</p>

 summary : <p>The idea is simple. We love web apps because they are flexible and powerful. We love geo-aware apps because they can do wonders with the location information. Can we mix them? Not in principle, since the browser will not give the webapp the lat and long. GeoLaunch is a the starting point to build geo-aware webapps. GeoLaunch is a native app that gets the location from the iPhone location services and then launches a browser with the location as the GET parameters. From then on the Webapp knows where the client is! This is great mod privacy issues.</p>

 title : The geoxml Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GeoXml is a term coined by google themselves referring to Geospatial XML formats and the Google Maps API has its own tool for handling it. This project is a third party parser which can take its place and opens up the features to include more GeoXml formats and better OGC support... ie not just KML it also parses GML(such as produced by a WFS) and GeoRSS and GPX, its benefits include creation of collapsible tree based layer control (generally vertical in a sidebar).  It can also save out to its own kjson format (requires json.js or a browser with built in json toJSONString support). This parser in some cases actually handles kml created by Google Earth better than the API&#39;s GGeoXml. When a WMS base ground overlay is parsed in a kml it is auto-tiled as a GTileOverlay or GTileMapType making them first class citizens.   </p>

<p>I have posted this to better enable others to help contribute and fix bugs and track versioning and bug fixes.. ok the latter might be the biggest reason, anyway I have decided to publish this in a more visible public fashion. </p>

<p>•Professores: Responsáveis pelo envio de notas e presenças dos alunos, também poderão enviar avisos para pais e alunos, terão acesso a um ambiente de criação de exercícios e simulados on-line, além de enviar materiais complementares para as turmas, assim como a resolução de provas anteriores. 
<br/>•Alunos: Terão acesso a um banco de dúvidas, onde poderão consultar as dúvidas já existentes, como também poderão enviar suas dúvidas para que possam ser respondidas pelos professores, existirá um acompanhamento de seu desempenho durante o ano letivo, onde poderão consultar suas notas, faltas e um gráfico demonstrando o andamento de cada aluno. Além disso irão verificar o horário das aulas, realizar avaliação dos professores, e participarão de fóruns de discurssão. 
<br/>•Pais: Os pais poderão imprimir os boletos da mensalidade escolar diretamente do sistema, além de verificar as notas e faltas de seus filhos, notificação de professores e coordenadores sobre o desempenho do aluno ou possíveis eventos a serem realizados, além de ter acesso ao calendário de provas e verificar os horários. 
<br/>•Coordenadores: Serão responsáveis por enviar ao sistema o calendário escolar, enviar avisos para pais, alunos e professores, cadastrar novos eventos, efetuar a transferências de alunos, acompanhamento do desempenho de cada aluno e também das turmas em geral através de gráficos. 
<br/>•Diretores: Basicamente mesmo nível dos coordenadores, porém com uma visão geral de todas as séries, e não apenas de uma turma específica como os coordenadores. Além de acompanhar as avaliações dos professores realizadas pelos alunos, e um sistema de BI para acompanhamento do faturamento da instituição. 
<br/>Além dos tópicos específicos, o sistema contará com uma biblioteca on-line, e futuramente será implantado uma automação da parte de matrículas e gerenciamento da instituição.</p>

 summary : <p>When completed this will be a game in which you guide a balloon up through a maze of dangers.  One control style will be clicking the mouse near the balloon.  The mouse click creates a radial force that pushes the balloon away.  You can use this technique to keep the balloon from touching anything dangerous.  The other control style I would like to implement is to use the motion sensor on a macbook or macbook pro.  By turning the computer you move the entire game board thus allowing the balloon to float up and escape. </p>

 summary : <p>Because you&#39;re lazy, too. Web application testing for real world projects.Intuitive, fast test creationTestFire combines a FireFox extension, a management server and a distributed Agent to allow you to create, manage and run large numbers of complex unit tests quickly and, hopefully, with as little pain as possible. This is web developement; there&#39;s always some pain.  </p>

<p>Create sets of test via the TestFire extension and upload them directly to a centrally managed repository, managed by the TestFire server and a web interface.  Direct a test to be run either immediatly, or on a repeating schedule The use of Agents allows for distribution of the individually slow (but not computationally intense) Watij-based unit tests, allowing a single commodity-level PC to run multiple Agents via the use of virtualization.  Testsets can be created and run directly on a single machine, with only the TestFire Agent and Extension, allowing for validation of tests under construction, and, for smaller projects, as the entire testing platform. Current State of DevelopmentTestFire is currently in need of alpha testers and additional developers. There is a strong and significant framework in place, but many features need to be fleshed out, error catching written, I18N implemented, etc. </p>

<p>Those with a strong background in Javascript would find themeselves quite welcome in aiding in the development of the Extension module. Typical web applications developers would be incredibly welcome in the Server module, and those that just want to dable and learn from a large, fairly well organized code base are welcome to poke and prod wherever they may.  </p>

<p>Developer Friendly: A note from the creatorA primary goal of mine in developing this framework (until I fell massively behind at any rate), was to make the project developer friendly; this means a sophisticated build/install system, logical division of code structure, comments, and most importantly a willingness to help those who wish to further this project. So feel free to jump in, no matter what your skill level. While I may not have as much time to aid those who need help unrelated to this project, where I am able I will be glad to help you help this project. </p>

<p>The modules that make up TestFireTestFireExtension: The Firebug Extension that is the test creation front-end to the TestFire web application testing environment. TestFireModel: The Model definition that TestFire relies on to construct and parse testsets.  TestFireSupport: Support files for creating the development environment and generally making developers lives easier. TestFireAgent: The Agent, a local interface between the Extension and the Mangement Server. Also capable of supporting single user testing directly, with the Extension as a front-end.  TestFireServer: The Management Server front end to managing web applications tests, enterprise wide. IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTEDue to the lack of a Project -&gt; module hierarchy on source hosting sites (such as Google Code), and a lack of a multiple licensing scheme here at Google Code, this project is listed as being Licensed under the Mozilla Public License, 1.1. this is the case for ONLY the TestFire Extension module, which utilizes code from the (awesome) Firebug extension.  </p>

<p>The other modules are all listed under the MIT License. See the licensing information in each module folder for more information.</p>

<p>At this point, this project is nothing more than a learning exercise for me. I would attempt to create something useful through it, but no promises. </p>

<p>Next (Initial) Release?No plans yet... </p>

<p>DetailsIt&#39;s darn hard to build rich client applications from raw swing wedgets, but all the frameworks out there doesn&#39;t quite do it for me either. This project is a personal endeavour  to create a framework that I would actually enjoy using. </p>

<p>Design PrinciplesInstead of describing what that is, I&#39;ll just make a few generalised statements about myself. I think they will be reflected in my choices in design and code. </p>

<p>I believe in Agile principles (DRY, YAGNI, convention over configuration, testing, incremental releases...) I am a fan of ruby, rails and dynamic languages. I code mostly in java but I wish I could have some ruby-like language features... I&#39;m writing this thing for myself, I&#39;ll solve the problems I want to solve first then we&#39;ll see. Design GoalsMinimal yet powerful API, takes advantage of static typing but dynamic whenever appropriate. No boiler plating necessary, it should be easy to stay DRY. Encourage good design, making it virtually impossible to mix business logic with UI. Offer clean interface with back-end, for integration and testing benefits. It should be easy to unit test UI components. Development effort should be proportional with application complexity, easy to get something simple going and add complexity as needed.  The &quot;Hello World&quot; demo should be under 20 lines of concise code. Technology Choices(at time of project creation) </p>

 summary : <p>ghunterEver since I saw pcman’s XD Programming, </p>

<p>I have been practicing using glade to work on a picture-watching program. </p>

<p>The habit that I have of reading comic books. </p>

<p>Designing a handy program for reading comic books on my own. </p>

<p>I participated in CMake sometime before, thinking I am unfamiliar with autotools, </p>

<p>and why not take this chance to learn CMake? </p>

<p>Therefore, I have created this version. </p>

<p>v 0.0.5 (2008/12/05)  </p>

<p>add f to fullscreen &amp; q to exit program add use key to scroll image  Fix issue - slideshow can&#39;t zoom fit Fix issue - rotate Add feature - zoom in &amp; out (code not yet) </p>

<p>v 0.0.4 (2008/11/22)  </p>

<p>Fix issue - reopening images can&#39;t be correctly Add best fit Modify briefing to slideshow, and &quot;10 secs&quot; to &quot;03 secs&quot; Add logo file (design by bow: http://www.ismall.com.tw/qpainter_view.php?id=5&amp;mode=1&amp;page=1) Make deb package for lenny </p>

<p>v 0.0.3 (2008/05/31)  </p>

<p>Multilingual  Solutions to the absence from glade </p>

<p>v 0.0.2.5 (2008/04/06)  </p>

<p>Change to cmake Some easy installments for modification of .h  </p>

<p>v 0.0.2 (2007/10/13)  </p>

<p>Fix the already-known bug of 0.0.1 Drastic modification of program (since I am not familiar with glade, I misuploaded items.) New function for briefing (1 sec、 5 sec、 10 sec, respectively.) Support the operation of keyboards.  </p>

<p>v 0.0.1 (2007/10/08)  </p>

<p>Normal fit No more scrollbar, and you can move the location for pictures directly. Contained with functions of opening table of contents and preview after opening files. Use roller to control the change of page. The next page after the final one is the first page, and vice versa. Pushing the middle button comes full screen.  </p>

<p>Installment instructions: </p>

 title : The gi-torrent Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of the project is to build a GUI for rTorrent  based on the Tibco GI framework and document the XML definitions for the XMLRPC interfaces needed to call the services. The usage will probably be limited to remote administration over HTTP, so f.i. running rTorrent on NLSU2 with lighttpd as a web server. You need to run a version of rTorrent compiled with XMLRPC enabled, see rTorrent XMLRPC guide. Second step is setting up your webserver for XMLRPC, see WiKi.  </p>

<p>The big advantage is that there is no (giTorrent) code running on the rTorrent machine. Once the giTorrent is loaded, it uses XMLRPC calls to rTorrent that use very little resources on the rTorrent server machine. You can find installation instructions for local install and webserver install in the Wiki pages. An attempt at a user manual is available at the Wiki. </p>

<p>giTorrent Live! </p>

<p>For the lazy ones out there,I have created a web page on a free hosting network that starts giTorrent, so you do not have to install. Downside is : </p>

<p>these free providers have variable uptime they can disable the account without reason they have a download limit they have variable performance (mostly sluggish) this mode requires specific browser settings (see Wiki)  this mode does not allow you to change the initial connection settings </p>

<p>Cool, at least you can checkout the new version before downloading it. </p>

<p>giTorrent Live! (@110Mb) </p>

<p>Tibco GI is an opensource AJAX framework that provides GUI functionality combined with connectivity to services and a XSLT like mapper. More information on Tibco GI can be found at Tibco GI Devnet. </p>

 summary : <p>Gisgraphy is a free and open source framework. Its goal is to provide tools to use free GIS Data on the Web. Actually it manage Geonames and OpenStreetMap (34 million entries). it provides an importer to inject the data into a strongly typed Postgres / Postgis database and use them via webservices : worldwide geocoding, worldwide reverse geocoding, fulltext and find nearby.Results can be output in XML, Atom, RSS, JSON, PHP, Ruby, and Python. Here are the main functionalities :  </p>

<p>Importers for Openstreetmap data in csv format Importers from geonames CSV files, reporting of inconsistencies and a report when import is complete. Just give the country(ies) you wish to import and / or the placetypes, and Gisgraphy download the files  and import them with all the alternateNames (optional), and sync the database with the fulltext search engine REST Web Services   Full text search  (based on Lucene / Solr  with default filters optimized for city search (case insensitivity, separator characters stripping, ..) via an Java API or a webservice 
<br/>An admin interface Fully replicated / scalable / high performance / cached services Findnearby function (with limits, pagination, restrict to a specific country and/or language and other useful options) via a Java API or a Web Service Search for zipcode or name Several output formats supported : XML, json, php, ruby, python, ATOM, GEORSS... Dojo widgets / prototype / Ajax to ease search but can be use it even if javascript is not enabled on the client side Plateform / language independent because of webservices Provides all the countries flags in svg and png format more...

 title : The git-svn-py Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency, but just as well suited for small personal repositories; it is especially popular in the open source community, serving as a development platform for projects like the Linux Kernel, Ruby on Rails, WINE or X.org. </p>

<p>Subversion is an open-source revision control system, which aims to be a compelling replacement for CVS </p>

<p>git-svn is script to bidirectionally manipulate svn repository in git way. </p>

<p>Currently the official git-svn is implemented in perl. It makes extensive use of fork/exec, which makes it a CPU-hog on msysgit/Widnows. Also, it requires msys version perl, which is not easy to compile. The target of this project is to reimplement git-svn in python, by using the official python interpreter(published by python.org or provided by distributions). When importing svn repository to git, git-fast-import is used, which eliminates fork/exec&#39;s at each revision.</p>

The Green Map initiative aims to help people develop eco-friendly maps, both paper- and web-based, to help people make the the best use of the reuse facilities in their city.  There is already a paper-based Glasgow green map in production and we aim to leverage it with this addition community resource. </p>

<p>The online map will be a system relying on the Google Maps API (though the code will make this interchangeable with other online mapping sites).  We aim to have a very visual searchable interface where members of the community can search within their designated areas. The map is initially aimed at the poorest demographic in Glasgow.  As this map is being developed as part of a community effort it will be licensed under an open source licence. </p>

 title : The glint-ui Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Glint is an open-source UI framework developed primarily for use in C++ applications. It is bulit around the concept of &quot;UI Node&quot; which can form a &quot;UI tree&quot;. On that tree, Glint performs layout (computing required sizes and setting final bounds of nodes), drawing (recursive compositing with transform and clip support), input handling (converting input in events and traversing the tree to deliver the events), focus handling (for keyboard input and to provide visual cues) and animations support (for transitional animations). </p>

<p>To illustrate the difference from other UI frameworks, here are main design principles of Glint: </p>

<p>1. Small and fast, compiled from source and statically linked with the app. No separate distribution, no DLLs, reg entries, dirs etc. A small static lib. </p>

<p>2. Does not use ATL, MFC, COM, Boost and uses very little C++ features like templates to make it readable as much as possible and easy to compile into application&#39;s project. </p>

<p>3. It is not all things for all the people - but it is so simple that all people can add things they want. Basically, it can be thought as a good place to start and then customize. </p>

<p>4. No pre-packaged hi-level controls like listboxes or tabbed panels. Glint has Node, ImageNode, NineGrid, SimpleText, Button, Row, Column and some other types of nodes. Not even editable text control although this can change in the future.</p>
 summary : <p>Glista aims to be a very simple personal to-do list manager that does what it&#39;s supposed to, and does not get in your way. </p>

<p>The main focus of Glista is on staying a very simple tool. We believe task tracking is a trivial part of our daily work (or life) and that it should stay trivial. </p>

<p>Technically, Glista is written in C and uses the Gtk+ grapical toolkit and Glib, making it potentially cross-desktop and cross-platform.  </p>

<p>Currently it is known to runs on different flavours of GNU/Linux, but should be easily portable to other UNIX-like systems, and also to Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.</p>

 summary : <p>GLU: GENOTYPE LIBRARY AND UTILITIESWhole-genome association studies are generating unprecedented amounts of genotype data, frequently billions of genotypes per study, and require new and scalable computational approaches to address the storage, management, quality control, and genetic analysis. GLU is a framework and a software package that was designed around a set of novel conceptual approaches. GLU addresses the need for general and powerful tools that can scale to effectively handle trillions of genotypes. </p>

<p>Key innovationsCompressed binary genotype storage Data sets are usually not loaded into main memory unless absolutely necessary.  Instead many of the analytical functions read the data in small chunks, perform the requested analysis, then move on to the next. Integration with a high-level scripting language for easy customization and extension Support for parallel processing and distributed computing (more on this in later versions) Data management featuresThe ability to import, export, merge, and split genotype data among several common formats and standards Filter based on powerful criteria for inclusion, exclusion Rename and adjust sample and locus metadata Genotype quality assuranceEstimation of assay completion and other summary statistics Reproducibility and concordance Verification of known and detection of unknown duplicate samples Empirical sex determination Testing for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, Mendelian inheritance patterns, non-random patterns of missing data. Analytic toolsFitting generalized linear models to test for phenotype/genotype association Fast linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation Fast tag SNP estimation with the ability to augment SNPs from set panels with a optimal tag SNPs using flexible criteria including design scores from major genotyping vendors. ExtensibilityViewed as a library or framework, GLU is designed to be highly extensible, so that it may be easily augmented, customized, and serve as a foundation for the rapid development of new applications. </p>

<p>DownloadBuild and installationWARNING: Please make sure you installed all the required development packages and/or libraries suitable for your distribution! If it don&#39;t build, chances are the problem is on your side or, although I always try to commit code that compiles, you&#39;re very unlucky and you&#39;ve just fetched the source code while it&#39;s broken. If so, try a previous revision until the problem is fixed in HEAD. So please, don&#39;t file an issue unless you&#39;re really sure it is a problem with Gmail Notifier! </p>

<p>The latest code (in trunk/) will only work with KDE &gt;= 4.2.0. If you wish to give it a try, just follow these steps: </p>

<p>$ svn co http://gmailnotifier.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gmailnotifier
<br/>$ cd gmailnotifier
<br/>$ mkdir Build; cd Build
<br/>$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debugfull
<br/>$ make
<br/>$ sudo make install
<br/>$ kbuildsycoca4 # Shouldn&#39;t be necessary but won&#39;t do any harmIf you use KDE &lt; 4.2.0 you&#39;ll have to stick to rev. 59 (which is quite buggy but should work on most setups), do: </p>

<p>$ svn co -r59 http://gmailnotifier.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gmailnotifier
<br/>$ cd gmailnotifier
<br/>$ mkdir Build; cd Build
<br/>$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debugfull
<br/>$ make
<br/>$ sudo make install
<br/>$ kbuildsycoca4 # Shouldn&#39;t be necessary but won&#39;t do any harmNote: The above commands will fetch, build AND install Gmail Notifier on your system. </p>

<p>UpdateTo update the code to the latest revision do: </p>

<p>$ cd /path/to/gmailnotifier

<br/>$ make
<br/>$ sudo make installNote: The above commands will build Gmail Notifier in full debug mode. Replace &quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debugfull&quot; with &quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release&quot; if you don&#39;t need this (but note that if you find a bug or something it is usually helpful to have some debug output to submit with your bug report). </p>

<p>Uninstallation$ cd Build/
<br/>$ sudo make uninstall
<br/>$ kbuildsycoca4 # Shouldn&#39;t be necessary but won&#39;t do any harmNote #1: There are no tarballs available! Code is only available through the SVN repo.

<p>A problem? Bug? Any kind of weird behavior? File a defect report! </p>

<p>You should check the already opened issues before. Perhaps your problem was already reported by someone else. </p>

<p>Note #1: Please, please, please! Before filing a defect report (especially reports saying you can&#39;t build Gmail Notifier), make sure you installed all the required development packages/libraries suitable for your system/distro. Since I&#39;m only using one single distro, I&#39;ll be glad to hear what are the necessary packages for the distro you&#39;re using (drop me an e-mail), I&#39;ll then add this to that page.
<br/> Note #2: If you made a patch that you would like to see included in Gmail Notifier&#39;s codebase, please don&#39;t send it to me by e-mail. Instead, use the issue tracker so that other people can comment, star, etc... your work. Thanks! </p>

 title : The gmapcatcher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewGMapCatcher is an offline maps viewer. It downloads CloudMade, OpenStreetMap or Google Map tiles automatically, display them using a specific GUI. User can view the maps while offline. GMapCatcher doesn&#39;t depend on google-map&#39;s java scripts so it should work even if google changes them. It also provides a downloading tool. </p>

<p>GMapCatcher is written in Python 2.6, can run on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. </p>

<p>   </p>

<p>You can find a list of improvements and latest features in the Changelog </p>

<p>Downloadhttp://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/files/GMapCatcher-0.6.3.0.tar.gz </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>$ svn checkout http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/svn/trunk gmapcatcherFor Windows users, get the latest Windows installer </p>

<p>Usagemaps.py is a gui program used to browse google map. With the offline toggle button unchecked,  it can download google map tiles automatically. Once the file downloaded, it will reside on user&#39;s hard disk and needn&#39;t to be downloaded again any more. At release 0.02, it use multi-threaded downloader and can be faster. </p>

<p>After version 0.04, user can force GMapCatcher to re-download old map tiles by checking &quot;Force update&quot;. If a tile is older than 24 hours, it will be re-downloaded. </p>

<p>download.py is a downloader tools that can be used to download google map&#39;s tiles without gui. maps can use files it downloaded without configuration.  </p>

<p>Below is an example using download.py: </p>

<p>$ download.py --location=&quot;Paris, France&quot; --max-zoom=16 --min-zoom=0 --latrange=2.0 --lngrange=2.0Files$HOME/.googlemaps/*DependenciesWindows users are highly recommended to download the latest Windows installer. This installer contains all required packages, works well on Win 2K, XP, Vista and Win 7. For a complete list of tested OS, see wiki Tested Operating Systems. </p>

<p>If you choose the tarball (because you have a legacy Windows like Windows 98), you must install Python 2.6, GTK+ for windows, pygtk, pygobject and pycairo yourself. </p>

<p>Currently GMapCatcher also depends on Python Imaging Library (PIL). For gentoo users, emerge dev-python/imaging. </p>

 summary : <p>GmockGmock is a mocking framework for the Groovy language. </p>

<p>Gmock is all about simple syntax and readability of your tests so you spend less time learning the framework and more writing code. To use Gmock just drop the gmock jar file in your classpath. </p>

<p>The current version is gmock-0.8.0 and is packed with tons of feature. </p>

<p>Checkout our official site at gmock.org and our documentation to get the full picture. Visit our roadmap to see what&#39;s coming next. </p>

<p>Getting StartedFirst extend the org.gmock.GMockTestCase. Create mock object using the mock() method. You setup expectation simply by calling method on your mock. </p>

<p>def mockLoader = mock()
<br/>mockLoader.load(&quot;fruit&quot;).returns(&quot;apple&quot;)The code you are testing should be executed within the play closure.  </p>

<p>void testBasic(){
<br/>  // create mock and setup expectation
<br/>  play {
<br/>    // run your code
<br/>  }
<br/>}In A NutshellMethod mocking: mockLoader.load(&quot;fruit&quot;).returns(&quot;apple&quot;) Exception mocking: mockLoader.load(&quot;unknown&quot;).raises(new RuntimeException()) Stub mocking: mockLoader.load(&quot;fruit&quot;).returns(&quot;apple&quot;).stub() Static method mocking: mockMath.static.random().returns(0.5) Property mocking: mockLoader.name.returns(&quot;loader&quot;) Constructor mocking: def mockFile = mock(File, constructor(&#39;/a/path/file.txt&#39;)) Partial mocking: mock(controller).params.returns([id: 3]) Times expectation: mockLoader.load(&quot;fruit&quot;).returns(&quot;apple&quot;).atLeastOnce()   Custom matcher: mockLoader.load(match{ it.startsWith(&quot;fru&quot;) })   Strict ordering: ordered {  ... } Optional support for Hamcrest matcher: mockLoader.put(&quot;test&quot;, is(not(lessThan(5)))) GMockController if you can&#39;t extend GMockTestCase in your test    </p>

<p>Here is a full example: </p>

<p>import org.gmock.GMockTestCase</p>

<p>class LoaderTest extends GMockTestCase {
<br/>  void testLoader(){
<br/>    def mockLoader = mock()
<br/>    mockLoader.load(&#39;key&#39;).returns(&#39;value&#39;)
<br/>    play {
<br/>      assertEquals &quot;value&quot;, mockLoader.load(&#39;key&#39;)
<br/>    }

 summary : <p>About File Browser AppletFile Browser Applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. It lets you browse and open files in your computer directly from the panel, without having to open a file manager. It is not intended as replacement to proper file managers like nautilus. Sometimes you just want to open a file and don&#39;t want to have to open a file manager, browse to and open the file, then close the file manager. This Applet just saves you couple of clicks. </p>

<p>NOTE 1: From now on .Deb packages will be created and hosted here </p>

<p>NOTE 2: As of version 0.5.5 this project has been renamed. If you&#39;re installing from source, It is recommended that you completely uninstall any installed versions older than 0.5.5 before installing this one! </p>

<p>Version 0.6.5Fixed &amp;nbsp;bug #69&amp;nbsp; (thanks to Ivan Baldo for report and fix). Fixed &amp;nbsp;bug #71&amp;nbsp;.

<p>Gnome MPlayer is not dependent on any Gnome libraries. However. the look and feel of the application is based on the Gnome HIG. The main dependency is on GTK2, GLIB2 and DBUS.</p>
 summary : <p>Global Menu Bar for GNOME</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Global Menu is the globally-shared menu bar of all applications launched in your desktop session. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This project introduces document-oriented concepts into GNOME, and improves GNOME&#39;s respect for Fitts&#39;s law. Most GTK applications work just fine with Global Menu. See ApplicationCompatibility for a list of them. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are several advantages by adopting a shared global menu bar in Gnome (thanks Matthew for organizing these):  </p>

<p>It works better with narrow windows, because the width of the menus isn&#39;t limited to the width of the window. (This is a problem for Gimp and Inkscape especially.) It&#39;s less confusing -- when two menu bars are visible on-screen at once, sometimes people choose the wrong one. Global Menu is the first step to move toward a Document Centric Desktop Environment ( ThoughtsOnADocumentCentricGnome ) which is, according to us, a long-term trend in DEs. </p>

 summary : <p>GobbleRSS is a web-based RSS reader inspired from the previous version of Google Reader.</p>

<p>It was developed as an alternative to Google Reader for people who need to access their RSS articles from home or work, but with the possibility to download unread articles to a PDA.
<br/>Since Google Reader doesn&#39;t yet have a public API that would allow a PDA to grab the latest unread articles, GobbleRSS was developed to allow PDA sync applications to download a single web page that contains a certain number of unread articles. You can then read those articles on the go.</p>

<p>If you find articles that you&#39;d wish to review later, simply note the articles ID that appear next to the articles title on your PDA. When you&#39;re in front of your computer, simply enter the numbers you&#39;re interested in reviewing in the GobbleRSS web form.</p>

<p>GobbleRSS allows you to star articles, and share your starred articles using your own RSS feed.
<br/>It also has a &#39;Keep Unread&#39; feature.</p>

 title : The goldenak-bot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The GoldenAK Bot is an all purpose Java bot, primarily designed to output everything what happens in an Call of Duty 4 server into an IRC channel. We mainly create the bot for that, but thanks to modules, many other purposes are possible too. </p>

<p>The sourcecode is pretty well documented, with a piece of text above almost every method and property to indicate what it&#39;s meant to do. This way, we want the project to be accessible by as many people as possible. </p>

<p>Current featuresAlthough this bot is still in pre-alpha stage (compiled .jar files are available when we feel like it), it is already usable and quite stable. Currently the CoD4EchoHandler module and the Connect module (which handles NickServ identification and joining channels after connect) are the only fully working and useful modules. This is because we&#39;re focussing on adding features to the bot and the CoD4EchoHandler. </p>

<p>Recently, support for timers became reality. This, in combination with the ModuleManager and the BotManager, will give you a pretty powerful bot framework in Java. At the moment though, there are no modules around which make use of the timer functionality, but we hope that&#39;s going to change soonish. </p>

<p>Also, all bots are now managed by using the new BotGroup class. A BotGroups is an object which bundles a bunch of bots, after which several operations can be done on either all of the bots or distributed over them. There are also a couple of methods to filter bots, so you can get a new BotGroup with only the bots you need. </p>

<p>CoD4EchoHandler </p>

<p>Supports logfiles over FTP, so the bot doesn&#39;t have to run on the same server as the Call of Duty 4 server. This module is currently undergoing a bit of a recode, and therefore there&#39;s not a lot of functionality, but once it&#39;s running, produces a nice echo including parsed map names, gamemode names, weapon names and body part names (where the last bullit hit when the player got killed). All this uses colors to differentiate the information in the messages easily. </p>

<p>Colors in player names are converted to mIRC compatible colorcodes as well. The number of kills and deaths is maintained and shown in the !players command. Anyone can use !msg to talk to the players ingame as well. </p>

<p>For people with halfops or higher in the IRC channel, the keyhashes are visible when a player joins the server, just as the teamchat.  </p>

<p>In the future we are planning to add admin commands, such as !kick, !(temp)ban, !rcon, and probably more. Other future features include customizable weapon names (for mods), customizable messages (if you don&#39;t like our template that much), and much much more. </p>

<p>Features currently being worked onAfter a long time of inactivity around this project, we&#39;ve decided to pick it back up again. This started off with a big code clean up which includes improving documentation and rewriting code to perform better. </p>

<p>This has completed for the most important bits of the program, and the rest will be done while new features are being added. </p>

<p>If you want to see the bot in action, join us on #LVP.CoD.echo on GTANet (irc.gtanet.com).  </p>

<p>We will continue development to hopefully one day release version 1.0!</p>
