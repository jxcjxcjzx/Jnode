 summary : <p>Vis5d+ is intended as a central repository for enhanced versions and development work on Vis5d, a free OpenGL-based volumetric visualization program for scientific datasets in 3+ dimensions.
<br/>This project started out, with the blessing of the original Vis5d developers, as a conversion of Vis5d&#39;s build process to use GNU autoconf and automake. (Inspired by the difficulty of getting Vis5d to compile on the author&#39;s LinuxPPC PowerBook.) It quickly became apparent that many other enhancements were possible, and were of wide interest to users. Moreover, a large number of enhanced versions to Vis5d exist that have not been merged into the original Vis5d sources, due to time and resource limitations of the original developers, or to differences of opinion about design directions.</p>

 summary : <p>As developers we often find ourselves writing small one-off pieces of code for use as samples, experiments, prototyping, handy utilities, or any number of off-the-wall-ideas. As it&#39;s usually considered throw-away code we end up abandoning it shortly after we&#39;re done using it.</p>

<p>-- But why?</p>

<p>Typically because we don&#39;t consider the code to be worth the effort of starting a new OSS project just to keep track of it. Well no longer!</p>

<p>-- A home for all code</p>

<p>The Code Incubator servers as a repository for all of those throw-away bits we churn out. We keep them here so that other may find them, use them, and maybe even learn a little something from them. </p>

 title : The Sippy SIP B2BUA Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Sippy B2BUA is a RFC3261-compliant SIP Back-to-back user agent (B2BUA).</p>

<p>Unlike a SIP proxy server, which only maintains transaction state, the B2BUA maintains complete call state and participates in all call requests. For this reason it can perform number of functions that are not possible to implement using SIP proxy, such as for example accurate call accounting, pre-paid rating and billing, fail over call routing etc. Unlike PBX-type solutions such as Asterisk for example, the B2BUA doesn&#39;t perform any media relaying or processing, therefore it doesn&#39;t introduce any additional packet loss, delay or jitter into the media path. </p>

<p>Sippy B2BUA supports RADIUS AAA protocol, which is compatible with Cisco VoIP gateways allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into existing networks.</p>

 title : The Test::Server Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ever heard of test driven development? What about test driven administration? Take a look around examples/ folder for example tests that you can run agains your server.</p>

<p>The general configuration should be done through the test-server.yaml and should be managable by any non Perl awear admin (are there any?). Of course you are free to put any other test that make sence for your server.</p>

<p>The idea behind this is following: You run prove /etc/t and everything is fine. Server is up and running. Life is nice. Then somebody calls you at 3am... Oups! What went wrong? You login to the server (if possible of course) and run the prove /etc/t friend. Something failed? =&gt; fix it. Nothing failed? =&gt; write a test that will reveal that something is wrong &amp;&amp; fix the problem of course ;). And then at 6am go happily to sleep again...</p>

<p>To be the administration really test drive ;) you should be writing your tests before you install the server...</p>

<p>Any other benefits? What about migration || reinstalation of the server? Do you always remember what services || purpouses is the server used for? You just scp the /etc/t folder to the new machine and prove /etc/t will tell you. If not you&#39;ll write a test ;).</p>

<p>Or are you writing firewall rules and need to check if you didn&#39;t close some ports that you should not? Check out the 03_open-ports.t.</p>

 title : The Chocolate Doom Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Chocolate Doom is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely as possible to the original DOS Doom executables.</p>

<br/> * DOS is dead. DOS Doom does not run properly under modern operating systems (Windows XP/Vista, Linux, MacOS X, etc). With hardware and software support for DOS fading away, it&#39;s hard to see a future where it&#39;s possible to play the original.

<p>The aim of this project is to set up a tool composed of:
<br/>* a graphical Modelica editor, aimed at writing the plant model; 
<br/>* an editor for IEC 61131-3 languages (currently, the Ladder Diagram, Sequential Functional Chart and the Functional Block Diagram are being considered), aimed at writing the controller model; 
<br/>* a compiler to turn IEC 61131-3 code into executable code on selected target platforms; 
<br/>* a pre-compiler capable of translating both the plant and controller model in a single Modelica file, to be fed to any Modelica translator for simulation; 
<br/>an interface to the OpenModelica compiler, for Modelica code parsing, compilation, and simulation; 
<br/>* a simulation output browser.</p>
