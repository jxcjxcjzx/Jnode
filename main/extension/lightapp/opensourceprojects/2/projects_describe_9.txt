 summary : <p>MADNESS provides a high-level environment for the solution of integral and differential equations in many dimensions using adaptive, fast methods with guaranteed precision based on multi-resolution analysis and novel separated representations. There are three main components to MADNESS.  At the lowest level is a new petascale parallel programming environment that increases programmer productivity and code performance/scalability while maintaining backward compatibility with current programming tools such as MPI and Global Arrays.  The numerical capabilities built upon the parallel tools provide a high-level environment for composing and solving numerical problems in many (1-6+) dimensions.  Finally, built upon the numerical tools are new applications with initial focus upon chemistry, atomic and molecular physics, material science, and nuclear structure. </p>

<p>Underneath the hoodIf you would like a glimpse at what&#39;s going on under the hood have a look at this call graph generated using the Google perftools. It nicely shows how work is funneled through the task-queue and how about 50% of the time is spent in the optimized matrix routines.

 summary : <p>NoticeUse q4e or m2eclipse instead. Now q4e and m2eclipse supports WTP directly. This project remains for history :) </p>

<p>Release History0.1.2 (2007/08/03) - Added to proper classpath entries according to build scopes 0.1.1 (2007/06/26) - Fixed to display the popup menu labels correctly 0.1.0 (2007/05/31) - First released IntroductionThis plugin provides the integration of m2eclipse and Eclipse WTP. </p>

<p>M2WTP has the same goal with LibCopy, but manages J2EE module dependency instead of links(virtual file). The followings are differences from LibCopy. </p>

<p>Adds maven artifacts as required J2EE modules instead of links. Imports from maven project model directly, so don&#39;t need Maven Classpath Container. Supports the dependency between maven projects in local workspace. Provides the different classpath types as build scopes. This plugin requires Eclipse WTP 1.5.x or higher, m2eclipse 0.0.11.20070603-1200. m2eclipse 0.0.11 is the current snapshot version, so it is also distributed to ensure the integrity between M2WTP and m2eclipse. m2eclipse distributed here is the exactly same with m2eclipse update-dev, but later versions than 0.0.11.20070603-1200 may not compatible with m2wtp. </p>

<p>M2WTP is not a mature project yet, but It will be more efficient with this plugin when using Eclipse WTP and m2eclipse. </p>

<p>Please use the issue tracker if you have anything to suggest or find a bug. </p>

<p>InstallRequirements : Eclipse WTP 1.5.x or 2.0.x, J2SE 5.0 or higher </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to the OpenERP / Magento connector project!</p>

<p>      </p>

<p> </p>

<p>News</p>

<p> </p>

<p>What is it for?Want to sell your OpenERP managed product catalog on the web with the professional and scalable e-commerce Magento platform? Want to add a multi-stock, production (MRP), localized accounting or outstanding CRM to your e-commerce store, want to back it with an incredibly powerful ERP? Then that synchronization module is for you. </p>

<p>Warning:Both Magento and OpenERP are complex open source products. Make sure you master them correctly independently before attempting any synchronization. </p>

<p>Design principles of the module:The main module of the connector comes as an OpenERP plugin that keeps most of the business rules and settings on the powerful and extensible OpenERP platform. Magento is mostly used to for customers to enter their sale orders. </p>

<p>Still, as Magento has a rather sophisticated promotion and package management, one can use Magento to deal with the exact pricing rules (including shipping and taxes), the sale order is passed back to OpenERP with those Magento prices, no matter what was the original OpenERP pricing (Magento can override OpenERP prices). Taxes and discounts are properly handled. </p>

<p>Main featuresProduct catalog export from OpenERP to Magento (with common atributes but without pictures at the moment, that&#39;s our next wanted feature) Product stocks updates, based on OpenERP virtual stocks (number of products in the physical stock that have not been reserved yet) Category tree export, including creation and updates. Each Magento store has its own root category id, you can thus choose to where Magento store products get loaded. Taxes sync (provided that you first manually set up the magento ids of the OpenERP taxes see UserManual) Sale orders imports from Magento to OpenERP. Only new sale orders are imported. This process find out which customers are already in the OpenERP database or if they have a new shipping or delivery address. Only new resources are created. Sale order lines are created too. Discounts and taxes amounts are properly imported for each line so you can finally generate an invoice in OpenERP or trigger procurement, shipping or manufacturing operations according to you stocks levels. Broken sale order re-import function: if for whatever reason some sale order can&#39;t be imported; for instance because it is referencing a product that is not known inside the OpenERP database (which would just be an administration error), then once you fixed the missing product, this button gives you the opportunity to re-import properly those sale orders that failed previously. Minimal code and best practices coding so evolving and maintaining the code is a snap: very minimal extra OpenERP data structures and views. No extra Magento data structure nor extra view.    </p>

 summary : <p>Sending email can be a bottleneck in your Rails app.  Here&#39;s a dead simple way of making all your mail be delivered asynchronously. </p>

<p>With the plugin installed, all mail send from Mailer gets put into a table called QueuedMails.  Here&#39;s my migration to add that table:  </p>

<p>class AddQueuedMailTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
<br/>  def self.up
<br/>    create_table :queued_mails do |t|
<br/>      t.column :object,     :text
<br/>      t.column :mailer,     :string
<br/>    end
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  def self.down
<br/>    drop_table :queued_mails
<br/>  end
<br/>endNow everytime you call  </p>

<p>YouMailer.deliver_something(*params)that mail object will be stored in the QueuedMails table.  Just periodically call script/runner from a cron job to process your new mail queue:  </p>

<p>&quot;script/runner &#39;MailQueue.process&#39; -e production&quot;If you want to bypass the queue just called the deliver_method_name with an exclamation point at the end.  Like:  </p>

<p>YouMailer.deliver_something!(*params)WARNING:  </p>

<p>This feature to bypass the queue isn&#39;t the same way it was done in the original release of this plugin, so it isn&#39;t backwards compatible. Not a huge thing to change, and it probably wasn&#39;t a very popular thing used by people using this plugin anyways.  </p>

 summary : <p>Given a grammar in an extended BNF format, maketea will generate a C++ class hierarchy to store the abstract tree for that grammar, with support for deep (recursive) cloning, deep equality, and tree pattern matching (including wildcards). </p>

<p>In addition it generates explicit support for the visitor design pattern in the form of a visitor API, which makes it easy to define traversals over the AST. Visitors can include &#39;generic&#39; methods (for example, do such-and-such for every &#39;expression&#39;), but cannot transform the tree structure.  </p>

<p>Finally, maketea generates a transformation API which makes it easy to define tree transformations. An important property of the transformation API is that it uses the C++ type system to make it impossible to write tree transformations that violate the tree structure as dictated by the grammar. </p>

<p>Both the visitor and transformation APIs are set up in such a way to make their behavior completely configurable.</p>

There are some noticeable problems with the matrix (with decomposition) class and the expression evaluation class, but hopefully I&#39;ll solve those soon.  </p>

<p>Secondary Javascript ProjectThere is a very incomplete javascript implementation (MalloryJS) that I threw together one weekend, but I&#39;m not sure how much effort I want to put into it as ActionScript has a lot of features not found in JavaScript. Perhaps I&#39;ll put this on hold until JavaScript 2 becomes a widely accepted standard. </p>

<p>Future PlansIn the near future, I plan to implement the following features </p>

<p>Example usage Improved commenting Unit tests Equation solving Polynomial manipulation Numeric/symbolic integration and differentiation Conic Sections</p>

 title : The managed-sqlite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Looking for developers!  Please email me!About this projectManagedSQLite is a managed implementation of the public domain relational database SQLite.   </p>

<p>Currently, ManagedSQLite works with Microsoft Visual C# 2005, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2005. </p>

<p>Unlike other managed wrappers for SQLite, ManagedSQLite only requires its own DLL with no need for the SQLite DLL file - reducing the risk of DLL Hell. </p>

<p>Current version1.0.0.01340 (SQLite 3.4.0 with FTS1 and FTS2) </p>

<p>Download here: http://managed-sqlite.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bin/1.0.0.1340/ManagedSQLite.zip</p>

 title : The manageditk Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ManagedITK generates wrappers for .NET languages around ITK (The Insight Toolkit). </p>

<p>These wrappers can be used with any CLR language, including: </p>

<p>C# VB.NET C++/CLI IronPython Chrome and others. </p>

<p>ManagedITK is useful for a number of reasons, but mainly for the ability to rapidly create image processing applications with graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms (also known as System.Windows.Forms). </p>

<p>For wrapping of other languages (such as python and Java) please see WrapITK. </p>

<p>In short: ManagedITK makes (medical) image processing in C# easy!</p>

 title : The mangobot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mangos IRC Bot is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot written in the Java programming language that is designed to be used along with a working MaNGOS server. I started writing it as a small personal project and it has grown big enough that I believe that it has the potential to benefit other users. It has two main parts to it. One is that it can perform regular status checks on a number of different hosts and display the results either by updating the topic or messaging users. The other part allows users who have logged in to the bot to use commands that directly affect either the MaNGOS server or the database. </p>

 title : The manualgc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This garbage collector uses a mark-sweep algorithm . Unlike BDW conservative garbage collector , it doesn&#39;t guess the pointer . So you should link the objects (memory block) manually by call gc_link . Namely , you should tell the collector that a memory block&#39;s life time depends on the correlative one&#39;s . </p>

<p>On the other hand, you should give the scope of temporary variable on the stack manually.  It will be easy if you call gc_enter at the first line of the function, and call gc_leave at the last line. btw, you don&#39;t need to call gc_enter / gc_leave every time. For example, you can only call gc_enter before your main loop and call gc_leave after the main loop returned. (It may waste some memory, but it works.)  </p>

<p>If you have done those correctly , gc_collect will be able to determine which memory block won&#39;t be accessed any longer, and then free them.  </p>

 summary : <p>I&#39;m just in the beginning stages of learning how to program. There are heaps of creepy crawlies (bugs) and unfinished ideas (things that don&#39;t work, yet). </p>

<p>Newsapt development has moved to OSGeo4W, however I&#39;ve also merged most of the changes back to cyg-apt which I&#39;ll continue to maintain here for now. Not sure how to handle this going forward yet. Perhaps make both a single program and change behaviour according to the name starting it? e.g. cyg-apt --&gt; install cygwin, o4w-apt --&gt; install osgeo4w. That would certainly be DRYer. </p>

 title : The mapstouch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This application lets you use panning and zooming with multi-touch in the Google Maps Flash API: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Fp_0TZojg </p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to register your own Google Maps API key. Refer to the comment in GoogleMapsPureAS on how to choose the right url name to make sure you do not have ugly debug strings (like in the youtube video above) on your screen. </p>

<p>The second thing you need to do is to download the Google Maps for Flash API from here. You have to include the swc file from the folder lib of the uncompressed sdk.zip file either in your Flash GUI or put it into the libs folder of your Flex Builder project. </p>

<p>More details in the blog post about this project: Google Maps Multi-touch Actionscript Code </p>

<p>The Google Maps Flash API can be found here: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/flash/ </p>

<p>The code version of the touchlib&#39;s actionscript library can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/touchlib/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AS3%3Fstate%3Dclosed </p>

<p>The binary version of the touchlib can be found here: http://nuigroup.com/touchlib/. </p>

<p>For the touch signals TUIO is used from the nuigroup touchlib project: http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/pdfs/GW2005-KaltenBoverBencinaConstanza.pdf </p>

 title : The matrixdump Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>matrixdump is just a little PoC (and PoS) program i wrote in an evening to toy with ncurses and demo how you can drive a &quot;matrix&quot; like view using network data. i&#39;m surprised no one&#39;s done this before, but it&#39;s been on my mind since the original movie came out.  </p>

<p>matrixdump isn&#39;t as feature rich as tcpdump or tethereal, and the decodes are minimal. just the protocol, IPs, ports ... nothing else. the decodes could definitely be more interesting if you wanted to make them more usable. </p>

<p>amusingly, i&#39;m not a huge fan of the movies, they were ok but the sequels don&#39;t get me as turned on as the original.  </p>

<p>anyhow, why not drive some fun with a tool like this? part of this is me thinking about how to visualize CTF competitions, and part of it was me delving into the world of ncurses. </p>

<p>what&#39;s very funny is that this shows how lousy this interface is for actually looking at data. then again, you can say things like &quot;porn, porn, SYN flood, porn ...&quot; </p>

<p>matrixdump contains code from dugsong&#39;s dsniff (the pcaputil routines). </p>

<p>BUGSmatrixdump is just a toy, and isn&#39;t very feature filled or stable. </p>

<p>the scrolling is a bit wonky at times, but generall works. the color stuff is a bit wonky, set your term to &quot;ansi&quot; on some systems to get it to respect &quot;-c&quot;. </p>

<p>INSTALLATIONbuilt and tested on openbsd and OS X. it uses pcap, libdnet, and ncurses. you&#39;ll have to tweak a few things for other platforms probably.  </p>

<p>I know there&#39;re some projects that&#39;re doing the same stuff. But some of stuff i can&#39;t find in them are: </p>

<p>Well integration with Eclipse and flex builder Allow debugging java code and flex code in Eclipse Support session timeout in flex app (undergoing) And this project I created aims to support those targets </p>

<p>In this project, I&#39;m using flex mojos plugin to compile Flex app. The generated code can be imported directly to Eclipse (tested with 3.3.1) with WTP support, required to have m2eclipse </p>

<p>Click here to get started </p>

<p>Click here to download sample application generated from the archetype </p>

<p>Change logs: </p>

<p>11 Mar 2009: Added instructions how to compile module-based Flex application here 17 Nov 2008: Finally I squeezed sometime and fixed some of the issues. Please check out the code and build, alternatively using the command mentioned on 27 Sep 2008 to get the latest archetype Updates: Fixed &amp;nbsp;issue 6&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;issue 8&amp;nbsp; Updated to flex-mojos 2.0M8 Added dependency in flex-mojo plugin section to resolve license if any Created service-config-local.xml used for Flex Builder compilation. Remember to keep sync with service-config.xml!!!! </p>

Blue = the queue of cells from which the maze is to expand. Red = cells that are marked &quot;forbidden&quot; for growth because they are too close to other passages. Rather than just finding the route from entrance to exit, you now need to collect all the white balls on the way. More challenging. See-through grates give some visibility in/out of maze. Many other tweaks. Let me know what you think!   </p>

<p>2008/10/16: released v1.1 Show solution route (toggle via &#39;R&#39; key) Using this on a level disallows recording a new best score on that level. Auto-forward (toggle via &#39;Q&#39; key) so you don&#39;t have to hold down &#39;W&#39;. Note that SHIFT still toggles slow &amp; fast modes, independently of &#39;Q&#39;.

 summary : <p>A 3d globe with wms tile support and arc-ball based rotation. </p>

<p>There are three targets for this source code 1) flash 2) opengl 3) iphone native app. </p>

<p>1) Flash is a challenging target.  Historically it has been somewhat difficult to show a 3d globe in the browser let alone anything in 3d; solutions such as java applets are not universally supported, and flash itself although well supported has had no 3d support.  Papervision3d is a lightweight pure source code flash component that we leverage to make it possible to easily deliver a 3d globe in the browser.  This is hopefully a foundation for variety of projects, and being open source it can hopefully be improved by the community. </p>

<p>Here is a running example of an earlier rev of the flash version of this code: </p>

<p>http://hook.org/anselm/projects/20070901_MeadanGlobe/globe/bin/globe.html 
<br/>2) The OpenGL version is quite simple and a good development reference point although of course not competitive with NASA WorldWind or Google Earth.  There is a sample port of the same code to cygwin under windows under opengl as well in /opengl . </p>

<p>3) The iPhone version is more preliminary - the hope is to improve it with community support.  I&#39;ve built an installer so you can install it via community sources like any app.  To do this you first crack your phone (ziphone.org) then goto your installer, and goto sources within that, and then add a new source - that new source will be http://meadanglobe.googlecode.com/files/iphone.xml.  When typing in the iphone ui it will try to capitalize iPhone.XML - reject that suggestion.  Now you will have the globe as a source.  Goto your installer main menu.  Goto Multimedia.  Goto Globe.  Install that.  Now it will appear as an icon on your iphone desktop.  Congradulations.  All you can do right now is rotate it.  It does not fetch textures dynamically.  The sun position is static right now.  Please feel free to help out.  For the source code see /iphone.  This runs on the OpenGLES profile.   An executable is included. </p>

<p>Here is a screen-shot of the iphone opengl native version: </p>

 title : The meetingbrowser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Archives of meeting recordings are useful to check or to retrieve information from past meetings. However, such archives are usable only if appropriate tools, generally named meeting browsers, are available to locate the information that is searched for. One approach to meeting browsing is to design general-purpose browsers that help human users to locate relevant information, but another possibility is to design browsers that locate information automatically, for instance for verification (fact checking) purposes. The goal of this project is to design such an automatic browser, and to assess its performance on a set of pairs of true-false statements, which have been initially used to evaluate human-directed browsers. In other words, the goal is to design and to implement a system that determines the true and the false statement in each pair, to evaluate its performance over a set of several hundreds such pairs (for 4 recorded meetings), and to compare it with human subjects using existing meeting browsers. A comparative analysis of the system and the human scores on specific questions should indicate whether or not system and humans have the same difficulties answering such questions. This work will thus provide a baseline score against which humandirected browsers must be compared, to demonstrate significant improvement over a fully automated tool.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a small project which uses a PageAdapter to store the current pages viewstate and controlstate in memcached in order to reduce network traffic to and from the client, and to reduce the risk of any tampering. </p>

<p>The project should be frictionless and can be applied to a compiled ASP .NET app by configuring the site. </p>

<p>To use this you need to do a few things: 1. Add BeITMemcached configuration to your web.config. Look at the beitmemcached project (http://code.google.com/p/beitmemcached/) for more info on how to configure this.  The minimum required is to merge the following into web.config. </p>

<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/>2. Add MemcachedViewStatePageAdapter.browser from the test project to your App_Browsers folder 3. Copy BeITMemcached.exe and MemcachedViewStatePageAdapter.dll to your bin folder. </p>

<p>Author:  	William Wong Garay Blog:    	http://www.willywg.com E-Mail:  	willywg@gmail.com Support: 	http://www.willywg.com/2007/3/25/mephisto-share-it-plugin (Documentation in English and Spanish) Testing in: Mephisto 1.0 </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;What is this?&lt;&lt; </p>

<p>Mephisto Share It is a plugin that provides an unobtrusive way for your visitors to add your post to various social bookmarking sites. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Installation&lt;&lt; </p>

<p>1. Download the plugin archive from http://www.willywg.com/2007/3/25/mephisto-share-it-plugin. </p>

<p>2. Unrar the file mephisto_share_it.rar and put the &#39;mephisto_share_it&#39; folder into your vendor/plugins/ directory. Afterward, you should have a folder structure like this: vendor/plugins/mephisto_share_it/(a bunch of files). </p>

<p>3. Finally restart your application of mephisto. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Using&lt;&lt; </p>

<p>1. Personalizing. Open the mephisto_share_it.rb file in your vendor/plugins/mephisto_share_it/lib/ directory and change this data: </p>

<p>HOST = &#39;http://www.willywg.com&#39; #A. Change it for your  website 
<br/>. Activate the markers to use assigning them the true value and disable them with false nternational Bookmarks  DELICIOUS = true 
<br/>DIGG = true 
<br/>TECHNORATI = true 
<br/>GOOGLE_BOOKMARKS = true 
<br/>YAHOO_MY_WEB = true 
<br/>MAGNOLIA = true 
<br/>ispanic Bookmarks MENEAME = false 
<br/>FLOREAME = false 
<br/>ENCHILAME = false 
<br/>WEBEAME = false 
<br/>2. Drawing. Do this in your layout (for default values): </p>

<p>{{ article | share_it }} </p>

<p>This will generate: </p>

<p>Share It: »del.icio.us »Digg »Technorati »Google Bookmarks »Yahoo My Web »Ma.gnolia </p>

<p>Or use: </p>

<p>{{ article | share_it: &#39;Share this post&#39;,&#39;&#39; }} </p>

<p>This will generate: </p>

<p>Share this post del.icio.us Digg Technorati Google Bookmarks Yahoo My Web Ma.gnolia </p>

<p>3. If you want to use the bookmarkers separately you can make it in the following way: </p>

<p>{{ article | link_to_delicious }} or {{ article | link_to_delicious: &#39;Bookmark this with del.icio.us&#39; }} </p>

<p>Same way with link_to_digg, link_to_technorati, link_to_google_bookmarks, link_to_yahoo_my_web, link_to_magnolia, link_to_meneame, link_to_floreame, link_to_enchilame and link_to_webeame </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Adding a bookmarker&lt;&lt; </p>

<p>This is simple: </p>

<p>1. Add a bookmarker with the true value: </p>

<p>MY_BOOKMARKER = false </p>

<p>2. Create a function: </p>

<p>def link_to_my_bookmarker(article, text = nil) 
<br/>url = &#39;http://my_bookmarker.com/post?&#39; #the url of the bookmarker site 
<br/>url += &quot;url=#{HOST}#{article&#39;url&#39;}&amp;title=#{article&#39;title&#39;}&quot; #the values by get 
<br/>content_tag :a, text || &#39;My Bookmarker&#39;, :href =&gt; url, :target =&gt; &#39;blank&#39; #the tag A generated with the Bookmarker name  
<br/>end 
<br/>3. Adds the following line in the function share_it: </p>

<p>links += pre + link_to_my_bookmarker(article) + &#39; &#39; if MY_BOOKMARKER</p>
 title : The merb-geokit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>merb_geokit
<br/>===========</p>

<p>A plugin for the Merb framework that provides the geokit rails plugin.
<br/>This is mostly just a port of the rails plugin to merb format.  You should
<br/>see the documentation on the geokit project for more instructions.</p>

<p>site: http://geokit.rubyforge.org/
<br/>rdoc: http://geokit.rubyforge.org/api/index.html</p>

<p>using with merb
<br/>===============</p>

<p>Install with
<br/># svn co http://merb-geokit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ merb_geokit
<br/># cd merb_geokit
<br/># rake package
<br/># gem install pkg/merb_geokit-x.x.x.gem</p>

<p>Include it in Merb in your dependencies.rb file in the config dir
<br/>dependency &quot;merb_geokit&quot;</p>

<p>When you first startup merb it will copy a default geokit.rb file
<br/>to your config directory.  You should edit that file and add your API
<br/>keys to it.</p>

<p>geocoding
<br/>=========
<br/>This plugin comes with several geocoding interfaces.  You will need to sign
<br/>up for an API key for at least Google and Yahoo.</p>

<p>GeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)
<br/>GeoKit::Geocoders::YahooGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)
<br/>GeoKit::Geocoders::UsGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)
<br/>GeoKit::Geocoders::CaGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)
<br/>GeoKit::Geocoders::IpGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; address = &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC&quot;
<br/>=&gt; &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC&quot;
<br/>&gt;&gt; puts GeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode(address).to_yaml
<br/>--- !ruby/object:GeoKit::GeoLoc 
<br/>city: Washington
<br/>country_code: US
<br/>full_address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006, USA
<br/>lat: 38.898774
<br/>lng: -77.036655
<br/>precision: address
<br/>provider: google
<br/>state: DC
<br/>street_address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave Nw
<br/>success: true
<br/>zip: &quot;20006&quot;
<br/>=&gt; nil</p>

<p>session/cookie location store
<br/>=============================</p>

<p>If you want to store the geocode location of the user in a session
<br/>or cookie, based on IP address, then add the following to the top of
<br/>the Application controller</p>

<p>before :store_ip_location</p>

<p>then you will have:</p>

<p>session[:geo_location]
<br/>cookies[:geo_location]</p>

<p>acts_as_mappable
<br/>================</p>

<p>Acts as mappable works with ActiveRecord objects and will allow you to
<br/>do work with locations.  This would take an address, city, and state
<br/>and automatically look it up and populate the database with the results
<br/>from the search, including the lat, lng, and zip.</p>

<p>class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  acts_as_mappable
<br/>  validate :validate_address, :ensure_unique_address</p>

<p>  private
<br/>  def validate_address
<br/>    address = &quot;#{self.address}, #{self.city}, #{self.state}&quot;
<br/>    geo=GeoKit::Geocoders::YahooGeocoder.geocode(address)
<br/>    unless geo.success &amp;&amp; geo.street_address
<br/>      errors.add(:address, &quot;Could not find address&quot;) 
<br/>    end
<br/>    if geo.success
<br/>      self.lat, self.lng, self.zip = geo.lat,geo.lng,geo.zip
<br/>      self.address, self.city, self.state = geo.street_address, geo.city, geo.state
<br/>    end
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  def ensure_unique_address
<br/>    unless Location.find_all_by_address_and_zip(self.address,self.zip).empty?
<br/>      errors.add(:address, &quot;has already been taken&quot;)
<br/>    end
<br/>  end</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>rake tasks
<br/>==========</p>

<p>This plugin also adds rake tasks.  You must supply the address as an
<br/>environmental variable.  </p>

<p>$ rake -T geo</p>

<p>rake geo:ip      # Lookup up the address of an IP
<br/>rake geo:google  # Look up an address on google
<br/>rake geo:yahoo   # Look up an address on yahoo
<br/>rake geo:us      # Look up an address on us_geocoder
<br/>rake geo:ca      # Look up an address on ca_geocoder
<br/>rake geo:multi   # Look up an address using the failover</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>rake geo:ip ADDR=&quot;72.14.207.99&quot;
<br/>rake geo:google ADDR=&quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC&quot;</p>

<p>TODO

 summary : <p>O projetoO foco principal deste projeto é facilitar e tornar mais eficiente a pesquisa por informações relevantes, organizando os resultados obtidos de diversos buscadores em uma única interface e de simples utilização.  </p>

<p>Para isso, este projeto disponibiliza a gestão do cadastro das fontes de busca registradas pelos administradores da ferramenta em uma intuitiva interface web.  </p>

<p>O sistema é capaz de realizar buscas em qualquer outra aplicação web que já realize algum tipo de busca e retorne os dados no formato RSS. Se a resposta da busca não respeita este formato pode-se cadastrar um arquivo de parser que, por meio de expressões XPATH e transformações XSLT aplicadas a XHTML, transforme este resultado em RSS. </p>

<p>O manual de utilização apresenta maiores detalhes de como administrar e configurar as fontes de busca. </p>

<p>Para garantir robustez e eficiência, a obtenção das requisições das pesquisas são processadas paralelamente e os seus resultados salvos em um sistema de cache capaz de atualizar as pesquisas realizadas de acordo com o uso do metabuscador. O sistema é completamente escalável, pois permite a configuração de vários servidores para realizar as pesquisas. Veja em dicas de configuração como escalar e otimizar o Metabus. </p>

<p>Mais detalhes técnicos sobre o projeto também podem ser visto na wiki de tecnologias utilizadas e modelagem do sistema. Detalhes de instalação podem ser encontrados no manual de instalação. </p>

<p>Durante o desenvolvimento haverá uma instância do metabus instalada em: http://metabus.aquarela3.com.br </p>

<p>ColaboradoresInterlegisEste projeto iniciou-se com a necessidade do Programa Interlegis de permitir a realização de pesquisas centralizadas por informações descentralizadas, a fim de melhorar a comunicação e o fluxo de informação entre os legisladores e aumentar a eficiência e competência das Casas Legislativas. </p>

<p>O resultado final será utilizado no Portal Interlegis buscando informações administrativas, legais e técnicas nos diversos sistemas de informações das Casas Legislativas e do próprio programa Interlegis. </p>

 summary : <p>Conceptually, MEWIT is conceived to be different from traditional work-flow based system which require the setting up of routing instructions and business rules before the system becomes functional. At the same time applications for collaboration such as Lotus Notes can be costly to implement and consume a lot of resources. These traditional applications also cannot easily cut across multiple organizations to deliver a particular service easily due to their rigid structure and licensing models. Users are added on Ad Hoc basis in a viral fashion using email as the main link. </p>

<p>Chief Executive Officers need to be able to identify key actions and cascade these actions down the chain of command to the last personnel in an effective manner without necessitating the deployment of systems that may take months or even years to complete. The CEO as well as the managers of the government need a tool to deploy actions, capture and monitor collected information down the task tree, gain feedback and take remedial actions before issues explode into problems with embarrassing consequences. As the task travels from person to person, information, such as documents and data is captured and accumulated in the MEWIT system allowing relevant personnel to access information in a timely manner. The goal here is to spend more time doing the work that needs to be done rather than looking for the things that one needs to work. </p>

<p>Traditional database driven approach requires complex programming due to it&#39;s highly structured approach. Creating this structure has always been a major challenge within the Malaysian Government. MEWIT is simple in it&#39;s deployment due to the unstructured, document centric way in which it is implemented. The routing engine is the human being itself from which the system learns over time. It has a web based, mobile based (coming soon) as well as a desktop client based component (coming soon). This draws on social networking for workflows. </p>

<p>It is entirely built with a highly modular concept on Open Standards to allow the best fit of technological tools required for a particular requirement. All tools such as content intelligence, Statistical analysis, heuristics and the like can plug into the main open source component of the MEW using open JAVA based APIs. </p>

<p>At the same time, a complementary rather than a displacement approach to existing systems. As the system tracks and documents the flow, modelling of the complete system can take place based on actual work being done. This is an evolutionary based approach that allows a greater chance of success in building large scale systems. </p>

<p>Furthermore, metrics gathered on used of the system can be used for the the measurement and tracking of HR resources, identifying areas of over and under utilization as well as a more accurate assessment of civil servants performance for the purposes of appraisal and counselling. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>MEWIT is comprised of several components. It is partly based on open source licensing for generic components such as it&#39;s client and some server based components as well as a proprietary secret sauce to glue the high end value added services together. For propagation purposes to promote ubiquity the basic client is a freely down loadable JNLP type application that communicates via normal smtp protocol to deliver the task items as an e-mail attachment. This client is similar in functionality to many PIM applications such as Lotus Agenda, Zoot, Outlook but is much easier to use and can integrate itself to the planned future premium services that allows collaboration, knowledge capture that traditional systems have not been able to achieve. Due to it&#39;s highly modular and open standards nature, deployments are at a speed of hours and days rather than months and years. These value added services exist in the network as a service and serves to orchestrate activities with many actors across many organizations in a seamless manner. </p>

<p>As an example are issues on Land which can involve Mine and Natural Resources, The State Governments and any number of parties and individuals who need to work on changes in legislation to achieve a purpose. At present this process is to complex and convoluted using paper trails that it takes years to achieve anything if at all (well, at least that is true here in Malaysia). Changing legislation is a nightmare What is there is tool that can cut across all boundaries and connect everything together within the context of a common goal.</p>

Check out the MikroQuad&#39;s bigger brother at http://AeroQuad.com!This project will use the Arduino Diecimila as the hardware platform to control a quadrocopter.  Software coding will be done in the Arduino environment.  The primary goal for this quadrocopter will be to create a low cost flying vehicle which integrates gyros, accelerometers and a GPS for attitude control compatible with a 2.4GHz RC controller like the Spektrum DX7.  A secondary goal would be to make this an autonomous UAV, which can fly to programmed waypoints without pilot intervention. </p>

 title : The mimeparse Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This module provides basic functions for parsing mime-type names and matching them against a list of media-ranges. </p>

<p>See section 14.1 of RFC 2616 (the HTTP specification) for a complete explanation. More information on the library can be found in the XML.com article Just use Media Types? </p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>parse_mime_type()   Parses a mime-type into its component parts.   parse_media_range()   Media-ranges are mime-types with wild-cards and a &#39;q&#39; quality parameter.   quality()   Determines the quality (&#39;q&#39;) of a mime-type when compared against a list of media-ranges.   quality_parsed()   Just like quality() except the second parameter must be pre-parsed.   fitness_and_quality_parsed()   Just like quality_parsed() but also returns the fitness score.   best_match()   Choose the mime-type with the highest fitness score and quality (&#39;q&#39;) from a list of candidates.  </p>

<p>UsageIn Erlang1&gt; mimeparse:best_match([&quot;application/xbel+xml&quot;, &quot;text/xml&quot;], &quot;text/*;q=0.5,*/*; q=0.1&quot;).
<br/>&quot;text/xml&quot;Note that neither quality_parsed() nor fitness_and_quality_parsed() are exported from the Erlang version. </p>

 title : The mimetype-fu Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?Some great Rails plugins like attachment_fu use the content type/mime type of a file to validate the instance of an object. The plugin usually gets the mime type using the CGI request, however, if the file is already in the system, this approach won&#39;t work. Adobe Flash is also known not to send the proper mime type. As an alternative, I wrote mimetype_fu, a simple plugin which will try to retrieve the mimetype. </p>

<p>Note that mimetype_fu used to only looks at the extension to define its mime type, that&#39;s not true anymore, this nifty little plugin uses your os to open the file and check on the header for the mime type :) (sorry windows users, mimetype will only check on the file extension) </p>

<p>How to use it?mimetype_fu extends the File class: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; @file = File.open(&quot;#{RAILS_ROOT}/test/test.mp3&quot;) </p>

<p>=&gt; # </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; File.mime_type?(@file) </p>

<p>=&gt; &quot;audio/mpeg&quot; </p>

<p>You can also get the mime type of the file by only passing its path: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; File.mime_type?(&#39;test.jpg&#39;) </p>

<p>=&gt; &quot;image/jpeg&quot;   </p>

<p>How to install mimetype_fuscript/plugin install http://mimetype-fu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ </p>

 title : The mingus Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>mingusWhat&#39;s mingus?Intervals, Chords, Scales and Progressionsmingus is a package for Python used by programmers, musicians, composers and researchers to make and investigate music. At the core of mingus is music theory, which includes topics like intervals, chords, scales and progressions. These components are rigurously tested and can be used to generate and recognize musical elements using convenient shorthand where possible (for example some acceptable chords are: &quot;CM7&quot;, &quot;Am6&quot;, &quot;Ab7&quot;, &quot;G7&quot;). </p>

<p>Bars, Tracks and CompositionsOn top of the core are data structures (mingus.containers) that make it easier to work with notes in bars, tracks and compositions. These containers lay the foundation for the remaining packages: midi and extra.  </p>

<p>MIDI and SequencingThe MIDI package can save and load MIDI files, and -last but not least- provides a general purpose sequencer for all the containers and a FluidSynth sequencer subclass. This allows you to play all your data structures straight from Python in just a couple of lines. Most of the icky timing and MIDI code has been abstracted away for you, leaving a clean, relatively simple API. </p>

<p>ExtraLastly, the extra package includes a LilyPond exporter which can be used to create sheet music in PDF, PNG and postscript. It also offers ASCII tablature and MusicXML exporting and a sound analysis module which can recognize notes and melody in raw audio data.  </p>

<p>Latest news2009/12/08 -- Arun Chaganty converted the repository to mercurial, which will hopefully improve our development process. You can still see the old subversion repository here, but it will not be updated. 2009/07/07 -- Version 0.4.2.3: Features a new MusicXML module by Javier Palanca and a new SequencerObserver module that can be attached to a Sequencer. Also includes a full copy of the license, a THANKS and an AUTHORS file and updates to the copyright information; so that we can get included in the next Ubuntu release. Release notes. 2009/07/02 -- Version 0.4.2.0: Contains the new tunings module, with information about the different kind of tunings for various instruments, and the tablature module built on top of that, which can export all the mingus.containers to pretty ASCII tabs. See the release notes for more details and some examples. 2009/06/29 -- Opened a new mailing list targeted specifically at developers and people wishing to follow the project closely.

 summary : <p>We developed new tools which cooperatively can be used to map evolving protein interaction networks at the module level. These tools are implemented as plugins for the widely used Cytoscape network visualization platform. The first plugin provides a user-friendly implementation of Affinity Propagation - a general purpose clustering algorithm (Brendan J. Frey and Delbert Dueck, Science 2007) which can be used to identify coherent modules in biological networks. The second plugin addresses the problem of visual analysis of network evolution and comparison of networks across species. It provides the capability to visualize consecutive evolutionary stages of protein interaction networks based on phylogenetic information. Together, the two plugins can be used to identify and trace the evolution of network modules. </p>

<br/>    }Unless overridden, all tables by default receive a primary key called &quot;Id&quot; that is a 32-bit integer that autoincrements if the DB supports it.  </p>

<p>Two local variables are used: company and employee.  This is about keeping it DRY.  Since the boo based DSL is actually a language, using language features like these local variables and the use of the Cardinality enumeration are possible. </p>

<p>Many of the methods in Mite have smarts.  The add_relation method, for example, does not need you to tell it that you want to relate employee.CompanyId to Company.Id.  It assumes that you are going to hook up to the primary key unless you otherwise specify. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the looks of the DSL, don&#39;t worry.  Mite migrations can be written in plain old C# as well. </p>

<p>Also, the boo can be written with C# naming conventions instead of the ruby-like ones shown above.  The same migration from above could also be written as the following. </p>

<p>company = &quot;Company&quot;
<br/>employee = &quot;Employee&quot;</p>

 title : The mobilefinder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MobileFinderDescriptionAn official SDK version of MobileFinder is available! See http://www.pixiotech.com This MobileFinder is not the official MobileFinder available from the App Store MobileFinder is a filesystem navigator for use with iPhones which have been jailbroken running iPhone OS version 1.1.4 or lower. MobileFinder is celebrating over 1,600,000 downloads to date! MobileFinder is part of a larger collection of tools in the MobileStudio NewsVersion 2.0 of iPhone OS has removed support for many of the features that MobileFinder depends on. This has made transitioning MobileFinder&#39;s codebase to 2.0 very difficult. The official SDK version of MobileFinder is a complete rewrite, and thus has been tailored to make use of the features that are supported on 2.0. Unfortunately, a 2.0 version of MobileFinder based on the hacked SDK is not likely in the near future. It has come to my attention that file operations in the system portion of the filesystem don&#39;t work on 1.1.3 and later due to access restrictions (I use 1.1.2, so I&#39;m a bit behind). I will attempt to address this in MobileFinder 1.9. Until then, issuing the following commands in terminal or via an ssh client fixes the problem: chmod 4755 /Applications/Finder.app/Finder
<br/>chmod 4755 /bin/cat /bin/chmod /usr/bin/chown /bin/cp /bin/ls

 summary : <p>Project management tool focused on supporting roadmapping, and task planing features.</p>
 summary : <p>NOTE: The actual streaming portion of the script is currently not working - ironic, I know. I don&#39;t have a ton of experience in streaming, but for anyone at all out there who wants to help out, the code is in the repository and a simple post anywhere will get my attention! </p>

<p>The aim of this little script is to provide an interface like the one found on iPod touches and iPhones, but for music that is to be streamed. I utilized the excellent iUi, which without this script could never be. </p>

<p>The script is in the form of a Rails application, simply because Rails is a capable framework with a built in server, and I love ruby! In the future, any C/Cocoa developers are welcome to join the party and throw it into a real, native application that can run on the host machine. </p>

<p>To install, get the script from SVN. Create a(n empty) database and then open up config/database.yml and fill out the development part. Then open lib/tasks/fill.rake and change the directory variable if that&#39;s not where you keep your music. id3lib-ruby is REQUIRED for the parsing of ID3 tags - it couldn&#39;t be simpler to install, just use sudo gem install id3lib-ruby and presto, you&#39;re good to go. (I&#39;m sure if this turns into a real app we can make an agreement with Robin Stocker, creator of id3lib-ruby, to bundle it.) Open up Terminal (or the command line...) and rake build:music. A list of all your music will be displayed as each song is read and put into the database.  </p>

<p>Start up the terminal and navigate to localhost:3000/, and voila, there it is.  </p>

<p>The main purpose of this group is to get word out so that we can find a way to stream the actual file. (The file&#39;s location is stored in a column in the database.) </p>

<p>Once again, iUi is the main workhorse behind all this, so go check it out if you&#39;re also building a MS application!</p>

 title : The moccasin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Moccasin is an ActionScript3 library which supplies the basic infrastructure needed to build an graphical editor in which a graphical view of some set of distinct objects is manipulated using keyboard and mouse gestures.  It supplies such fundamentals as a robust MVCS-style architecture with Mediators, object selection, object repainting and highlighting, multilevel undo/redo, document marshalling and persistence, and view scaling. </p>

<p>Moccasin is based on Flex/AIR.  In version 0.21, Moccasin allows Flex UIComponent-based view hierarchies, but also supports more lightweight Flash Sprite-based view classes. </p>

<p>The Moccasin project today has two main components: moccasin-core and simpleworld. </p>

<p>moccasin-core is the framework project.  When built, it exposes a SWC containing the full Moccasin library. </p>

<p>simpleworld is a fully functional AIR application in which squares can be created within a 2D graphical world, positioned, and resized.  These worlds can be loaded and saved as XML documents, support a number of different selection techniques, and all operations are undoable.  Although this is not a very rich application, it demonstrates most of the key capabilities of Moccasin and is a good starting point for creating more complex apps based on Moccasin.</p>
 title : The mocha-game-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mocha Game LibraryMocha is a C++ library for developing 2D games for both the Linux and Windows platforms.

<p>Moved to LaunchpadMocha is now hosted on Launchpad! Code hosted here at Google Code is obsolete. In fact, since moving to Launchpad, Mocha has essentially begun reimplementation, though the vision remains very much the same. </p>

<p>This page will still be maintained, particularly for the wiki pages. Issues and source code will no longer be tracked here. Please note that the wiki pages are dated and probably inaccurate. They will eventually be updated. </p>

<p>Planned FeaturesHardware accelerated 2D graphics Fast, arbitrary, real time transformations Hierarchical scene graphs Simple loading of image and texture data Support for multiple image formats, including alpha channels Text rendering with bitmap and TTF support Animated sprites Audio playback Simple panning and fading effects Support for multiple music and sound formats Sequenced music support, including Impulse Tracker and Fast Tracker formats Cue points for arranging and timing music Event-driven input Keyboard, pointing device, and gaming device support Signals and slots Device polling Resource management Virtual file system with drop-in packages Extensible resource parsers And more!</p>
 title : The mocha-ui Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MochaUI is a web applications user interface library built on the Mootools javascript framework. Canvas tag graphics are used for much of the Mocha GUI components. </p>

<p>IE8 RC1 CompatibilityAs of r426 in the SVN, all of the MochaUI demos should now be compatible with IE8 RC1 in both the &quot;IE=7&quot; and &quot;IE=8&quot; X-UA-Compatible modes. </p>

<p>As long as it isn&#39;t too far off in the future, sometime after the final release of IE8 I will probably release MochaUI 1.0. So if you want to get your sites IE8 compatible before that time please get the code from the SVN. </p>

 title : The mock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class. It is intended to reduce the need for creating a host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way. </p>

<p>This approach is inspired by the testing patterns used at Resolver Systems. </p>

<p>It also provides utility functions / objects to assist with testing, particularly monkey patching.</p>

It&#39;s inspired by Mac OS X modal dialogues. And yes, it may also be useful for showing bigger versions of images. :) </p>

<p>Basically, ModalBox is based on GrayBox technique by Amir Salihefendic. But you can find a lot of similar techniques around the web: Lightbox JS, Lightbox gone wild, ThickBox etc. </p>

 title : The modelando-madera Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Desarrollo de Software para Modelado y Fabricación de Objetos de Madera usando un Robot SCARAEn la actualidad las empresas requieren tener procesos automatizados tanto en su administración como en la fabricación de sus productos para poder competir en el actual modelo de mercado. </p>

<p>Desafortunadamente en la región maderera existen muy pocas empresas que cuenten con una automatización en sus procesos.  </p>

<p>Para automatizar una empresa se requiere principalmente de: </p>

<p>Software tipo ERP - CRM para la adminstración. Robots industriales para la fabricación de productos. Por parte la adminstración parece estar automatizada hasta cierto grado haciendo uso de paquetes de software como compiere, contpaq, entre otros; en cambio muy pocas empresas cuentan con robots industriales ya que estos requieren una inversion superior a los 1&#39;000&#39;000.00 pesos y en la mayoría son de origen extranjero lo cual implica que si llega a fallar es muy poco probable que se solucione en poco tiempo lo que conlleva a perdida de dinero y tiempo. </p>

<p>Observando la necesidad de la automatización en los procesos de fabricación de productos se optó por desarrollar una aplicación multiplataforma para el modelado de productos de madera haciendo uso de un robot SCARA. </p>

 summary : <p>AboutMongrel-ESI is an ESI Server built as a Mongrel::Handler.  It uses ragel to implement a native ESI Parser and the ruby language to make it easy to run and install. </p>

<p>ESI stands for Edge Side Include.   Edge Side meaning as near as possible to your customers.  Include because it&#39;s a set of tags you include in your pages. </p>

<p>Based on Mongrel, it is a light weight easy to install cache server that handles a subset of the ESI spec.  It&#39;s parser is written using ragel, so it&#39;s fast and portable. </p>

<p>SupportPlease feel free to ask questions or submit patches to the group </p>

<p>Installsvn checkout http://mongrel-esi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mongrel-esi </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>gem install mongrel_esi </p>

<p>Configuration OverviewAs of version 0.4 configuration is handled very similar to mongrel.  You can pass a -S option to have a special ruby script loaded that defines your own custom routing rules. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple example: </p>

<p>ESI::Config.define(listeners) do|config|</p>

<p>  # define the caching rules globally for all routes, defaults to ruby
<br/>  config.cache do|c|
<br/>    #c.memcached do|mc|
<br/>    #  mc.servers = [&#39;localhost:11211&#39;]
<br/>    #  mc.debug = false
<br/>    #  mc.namespace = &#39;mesi&#39;
<br/>    #  mc.readonly = false
<br/>    #end
<br/>    c.ttl = 600
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  # define rules for when to enable esi processing globally for all routes
<br/>  config.esi do|c|
<br/>    c.allowed_content_types = [&#39;text/plain&#39;, &#39;text/html&#39;]
<br/>    #c.enable_for_surrogate_only = true # default is false
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  # define request path routing rules
<br/>  config.routes do|s|
<br/>    s.match( /content/ ) do|r|
<br/>      r.servers = [&#39;127.0.0.1:4000&#39;]
<br/>    end
<br/>    s.default do|r|
<br/>      r.servers = [&#39;127.0.0.1:3000&#39;]
<br/>    end
<br/>  end</p>

<br/>From esi-lang </p>

<p>+ Inclusion - ESI can compose pages by assembling included content, which is fetched from the network.  This allows each such fragment to have its own metadata (e.g., cacheability and handling information) seperately associated. </p>

<p>- Variable support - ESI 1.0 supports the use of variables based on HTTP request attributes in a manner reminiscent of the Common Gateway Interface. These variables can be used by ESI statements or written directly into the processed markup. </p>

<p>- Conditional processing - ESI allows conditional logic with Boolean comparisons to be used to influence how a template is processed. </p>

<p>+ Exception and error handling - ESI provides for specification of alternate and default resources in a number of situations. </p>

<p>Surrogate-Control Header.  Using the Surrogate-Control response header you can enable or disable ESI processing.  Also, you can tell mongrel-esi how long to cache the response body by setting Surrogate-Control: max-age=50, where 50 is measured in seconds. </p>

 title : The monitr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>monitr is a modern network monitoring system written in Ruby. It aims to be extremely flexible allowing the monitoring of any system, while providing built-in definitions allowing rapid deployment of the system. </p>

<p>The system is built in three parts: </p>

<p>A core daemon that monitors a set of metrics, each belonging to one of a set of objects,  using defined metric types (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, ICMP, IMAP) and dispatches events based on changes in state. A drone that allows monitoring of non-remotely-accessible metrics on a remote machine (e.g. CPU temperature, IPMI), secured with SSL A web interface in Rails, which displays the metrics in a sensible manner including their current state and graphs of state history The web interface currently displays a table of metrics with their current states and a &quot;sparkline&quot; graph of their history (or the past few values for non-graphable data). A second view provides a full-size graph of metric history (using Gruff) or a table of past values for non-graphable data. </p>

<p>It will soon be possible to add, edit and remove objects and metrics from the web interface. </p>

<p>Metric type definitions included with the distribution are currently: </p>

<p>HTTP SMTP ICMP IMAP Remote drone plugin definitions included with the distribution are currently: </p>

 title : The monos-algebra Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MontezumaMontezuma is a full-text indexing/search engine library written entirely in Common Lisp. </p>

<p>Montezuma is a Common Lisp port of Ferret.  Ferret is a Ruby port of Lucene.  Lucene is sort of Doug Cutting&#39;s Java version of Text Database (TDB), which he and Jan Pedersen developed at Xerox PARC, and which, to complete the circle, was written in Common Lisp (see &quot;An Object-Oriented Architecture for Text Retrieval&quot;). </p>

<p>We are hoping Montezuma will have better performance than both Ferret and Lucene, not because of doing anything fancy, but because of relying on native code-generating Common Lisp implementations.  Currently performance approaches that of Lucene, but is far from Ferret&#39;s relatively blazing speed.  See PerformanceComparisons. </p>

<p>Montezuma is named after the Montezuma Oropendola. </p>

<p>Current StatusThe latest release is the Montezuma 0.1.3 release candidate featuring UTF-8 support and is available for download. </p>

<p>The first release was made July 13, 2006. </p>

<p>To install it: </p>

<p>(asdf-install:install &#39;#:montezuma)You can also download a tarball or check out the latest SVN source from this site. Montezuma is also installable via clbuild. </p>

<p>Indexing is complete, with both in-memory indices and indices on disk. </p>

<p>Single-term queries, boolean queries, phrase queries and wildcard queries basically work (though there are bugs).  Queries can be constructed via the API as well as by parsing a simple query language. </p>

<p>RequirementsMontezuma uses CL-PPCRE and CL-FAD, both of which are ASDF-installable. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tested it with OpenMCL, SBCL (version 0.9.12 or later, due to a bug in earlier versions) and ACL. </p>

<br/>;; MONTEZUMA::TEST-SEGMENT-INFO ......Development Strategy1. Make an initial hack &amp; slash port of Ferret to Lisp.  This is basically a transliteration of the Ruby code to Lisp.  It might be ugly, it might not be idiomatic, but the goal is to get something working quickly.  Unit tests will be ported as well.  Some features may be left unimplemented (e.g., thread- and process-level locking). </p>

<p>2. Clean it up.  Turn it into code that Lispers will enjoy.  Craft a nice external API and let it out.  A comprehensive library of unit tests will be critical to avoid breakage. </p>

<p>3. Tune performance and finish out the feature list.  Once the code reaches a point where it is both adequately useful and adequately pretty, begin the process of attacking the the last 20%, which is a task that will presumably never be complete.  Add benchmark tests, fix bugs, etc.  Ideally I will find someone who thinks this is fun--and dump the project on them. </p>

<p>We&#39;re somewhere between (2) and (3) now. </p>

 title : The moses Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Meta-optimizing semantic evolutionary search (MOSES) is a new approach to program evolution, based on representation-building and probabilistic modeling. MOSES has been successfully applied to solve hard problems in domains such as computational biology, sentiment evaluation, and agent control. Results tend to be more accurate, and require less objective function evaluations, in comparison to other program evolution systems. Best of all, the result of running MOSES is not a large nested structure or numerical vector, but a compact and comprehensible program written in a simple Lisp-like mini-language.  </p>

 summary : <p>MPSpack is a user-friendly and fully object-oriented MATLAB toolbox that implements the method of particular solutions, nonpolynomial FEM, and related boundary methods (e.g. fundamental solutions, layer potentials) for efficient and highly accurate solution of Laplace eigenvalue problems, interior/exterior Helmholtz boundary-value problems (e.g. wave scattering), and related PDE problems, on piecewise-homogeneous 2D domains. </p>

<p>We have now released Version 1.0. </p>

<p>Please see the Downloads page for a gzipped tar archive of the package, the manual which has installation instructions, and the all-important tutorial. See the Source page for how to download via svn (subversion) </p>

<p>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DMS-0811005 and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Grant EP/F06795X/1. </p>

<p>Below is an example image showing scattering from a square, accurate to 10 digits, computed in a few seconds. Spectral convergence is achieved using the following ingredients: decomposition into subdomains (nonpolynomial FEM), fractional-order Fourier-Bessel expansions around corner singularities, and an exterior fundamental solutions representation. With MPSpack this needs no more than 20 lines of code.</p>

 summary : <p>About MP-TVSeries Plug-inMP-TVSeries is a popular TV Series plug-in for MediaPortal, an open-source media center application. It focuses on managing the user&#39;s TV Series library with minimal user interaction, allowing for a more user friendly and ease of use experience. </p>

<p>The MP-TVSeries plugin will scan your hard drive (including network and removable drives) for video files, it then analyzes them by their path structures to determine if they are TV Shows. If the file(s) are recognized then the plugin will go online and retrieve information about them. You can then browse, manage and play your episodes from inside MediaPortal in a nice graphical layout. </p>

<p>The information it retrieves is coming from TheTVDB.com which allows any user to add and update information. The plug-in will automatically update any information so should for instance a series description change, this will automatically update for you. Please go there and support zsori (author and admin) by adding data and uploading artwork. Remember, without this database (and the mirrors people are kindly providing) none of this would be possible. All fields available there are/will be supported.  </p>

 title : The mrgrid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MR GridMR Grid is a Java/JSP web server application, that takes the well known molecular replacement (MR) program, Phaser1, and combines it with the power of Apple’s Xgrid technology.This allows a crystallographer to test more search models in a significantly shorter time, and reduce model bias by utilising extensive parameter sweeps. </p>

<p>MR Grid provides a simple interface where a user can upload their structure factor data in MTZ format, as well as either a tar or zip archive containing PDB files they wish to use as search models, and the parameters they wish to search with. MR Grid then divides the users input into smaller more manageable jobs, which it then sends off, along with a Ruby script to drive Phaser, to an Xgrid for processing. </p>

<p>Xgrid comes pre-installed on every mac running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and above. This makes it quick and easy to network existing desktop macs together to form an Xgrid, which MR Grid can then take advantage of by distributing tasks out to available agents on the Xgrid. </p>

<p>The only requirement that MR Grid has of the agents is that, because Phaser is not a universal binary, the agent must have the correct version of Phaser for it’s architecture installed. </p>

<p>MR Grid v.0.6.7MR Grid v.0.6.7 is now available in both the Downloads and Source sections. If you are upgrading from a previous version please be sure to read the upgrade guide. </p>

<p>Changes: # Fixed an issue related to tar archive extraction. </p>

<p>MR Grid v.0.6.6MR Grid v.0.6.6 is now available in both the Downloads and Source sections. If you are upgrading from a previous version please be sure to read the upgrade guide. </p>

<p>Changes: # Fixed an &quot;Unauthorised Access&quot; error that occurred when trying to access job results under Snow Leopard. Apple changed the Xgrid command line tool, so that date &amp; time output is now encased in quotes, prior to Snow Leopard, the output was unquoted. </p>

<p># Fixed an issue related to unzipping of .zip files. </p>

<p>MR Grid v.0.6.x Upgrade GuideWe have produced a guide detailing how to upgrade MR Grid. It is now available in the Downloads section. </p>

<p>Currently, this script is configured for Ubuntu Server, however with a little tweaking it should work on other distros. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it does: </p>

<p>creates mongrel_cluster YAML configuration file symlinks this file to /etc/mongrel_cluster creates nginx vhost file overwrites (and backs up) nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) restarts mongrel_cluster restarts nginx Before it does anything, it will list what it is about to do and await your confirmation. </p>

<p>Prerequisitesrubygems (to install the following gems) apt-get rubygems (on Ubuntu) mongrel gem install mongrel mongrel_cluster gem install mongrel_cluster nginx apt-get nginx Example usagecd /var/www/apps/myrailsapp
<br/>mrnginx -s myrailsapp.com,myrailsapp.netThat&#39;s it! (Except DNS configuration of course). </p>

 title : The msbfinance Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A personal finance accounting application that focuses on: - Tracking banking, credit, and investment transactions - Budget planning - Reporting and Forecasting </p>

<p>Most of the open source projects currently underway fail to cover all of these areas. </p>

<p>The application will allow tracking transactions for an entire family in banking accounts (savings, checking), credit accounts (line of credit, credit card), loan accounts (simple loan, mortgages), investment accounts (brokerage, mutual fund). It will offer the ability to create a budget to establish spending goals and saving goals. It will also maintain recurring income, expense, and transfer transactions. Finally, the reporting features will show how your financial situation diverged from your plan. The forecasting feature will allow you to predict what your financial situation will appear as in the future.</p>

 title : The multiwindcode Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The MultiWind MiniInstrument is a device that includes sensors and other features capable of emulating a wide range of types of wind musical instruments through software customization and through snap on expansion modules.  With other software and accessories the same MiniInstrument can also be used as a hands free control device with many capabilities for special needs users.   </p>

<p>More details are available at http://www.multiwind.com </p>

<p>The MiniInstrument uses the LPC2148 ARM based microcontroller from NXP.  The firmware includes an RTOS based on TNKernel and a USB stack based on LPCUSB with support for USB HID, USB MIDI, Mouse, Keyboard, and USB virtual serial port.  As such it may be useful for many applications beyond this project. </p>

<p>The hardware design also includes an expansion bus for the attachment of expansion modules with additional sensors, indicators or actuators.  Expansion modules use Silicon Labs microcontrollers. </p>

<p>A protocol is defined for communicating between the device and host computers over a USB virtual serial port. </p>

<p>Host computer software includes a gateway object to communicate directly with the device using the protocol.  There is also an application that uses the gateway to communicate with the device, translating to and from the Open Sound Control protocol. This allows complete control and customization of devices from any application that supports Open Sound Control. </p>

<p>The above software makes available a rich flow of sensor data that can be mapped to emulate a wide range of musical instruments and perform a wide range of hands free control functions.  It will permit experimentation with an unprecedented combination of convenience and power.  It is hoped that this will lead to better, more intimately controllable conventional instrument emulations, as well as unique instruments and control devices that have not before been available.  </p>

<p>This Google Code project is to host all software for the project including:  - firmware for the device - host computer software for Windows, Mac (and maybe Linux) - application software to create emulations of specific types of instruments or to support specific hands free control requirements.</p>

 title : The mushplatform Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mush Platform for Web, more than CMS.It make up of a small core runtime and  many addons(or plugins), just like eclipse platform but not for desktop, it is for web. </p>

<p>Core runtime in charge of managing all addons life cycle and composite them, both on front-end, back-end and administration console. </p>

<p>Every addon has several extension point, such as front-end pages, admin pages, admin navigation, back-end no-ui actions... As part of this platform, there are several core addons build-in there: site, column, article, template, user, admin. Other addons could be any web application, such as poll, comments, sns, forum, active forms, crawler etc... These addons could easily enable or disable on the fly(maybe we could provide an addon repository, in admin console user could see what&#39;s new to install or update). An addon could be easily added to any pages.  </p>

<p>When using Mush Platform, you have a start point to any form of website or web applications. Not only developer but end user could run a website in a few minutes. </p>

<p>We use Ruby on Rails to build the platform. </p>

 summary : <p>muSE - short for &#39;muvee Symbolic Expressions&#39; - is a Scheme dialect intended for use as an embedded language. It has some unique language features such as first class macros, simple general read-time evaluation syntax, vectors and hashtables that can be used as functions, and extensive use of pattern matching bind. </p>

<p>Highlight: muSE is used as an embedded language to specify the &quot;styles&quot; in muvee Reveal, launched on 11 June 2008. </p>

<p>Language and library featuresProvides lexically scoped closures as well as dynamically scoped blocks. Expressive reader macro system where macros are first class citizens (i.e. can be passed around as arguments to functions, assigned to variables, etc.) Uniform use of pattern matching for variable binding. Erlang style message passing processes. Networking support that&#39;s process aware. Generic functions (doc) Many polymorphic primitives - including map, filter, reduce, get, put, and some others. An extremely easy to use Objective-C bridge (only on MacOSX). A simple module system. Flexible exception handling Resumable exceptions Exception handler dispatch using pattern matching bind. Simple cleanup mechanism Reduce the need for local variables using TheAndIt. Built-in support for JSON. Built-in support for reading/writing a subset of XML . Integration featuresC-based, fairly well documented, simple embedding API. Can call as well as be called from C/C++ code.  Compact - Its easy to strip down the feature set to whatever subset of the core language you need. Extensible notion of objects to add new kinds of things to muSE in native code. Vectors, hashtables and ports (for I/O) are provided using this mechanism. Ability to add C/C++ based native functionality in the form of plugin DLLs. Ability to create StandAloneExecutables Supports multiple independent environments Liberal license terms - can use in commercial applications without publishing source code. License summaryThe license agreement has been changed (13Nov2008) to &quot;New BSD&quot; with the requirement that contributions be made on the same terms. </p>

 summary : <p>MyMateSummaryThis is both a school project and an old itch that I have to scratch :) </p>

<p>The purpose of MyMate is to combine the best features of Textmate, Emacs and Netbeans. </p>

<p>ObjectivesIt has to start fast and feel fast It has to provide scripting support, preferably in a dynamically typed functional language (Scheme, Javascript) It has to provide support for importing Textmate bundles (it is easy to develop and there are many bundles already developed)  Intellisense support for the main languages it is developed in, and basic infrastructure for quickly adding support for new languages Both Linux and Windows (and later Mac OS X) have to be supported GOOD INTERFACE DESIGN is paramount to any application, and MyMate has to look slim and sexy on each officially supported platform TechnologyThe chosen language is Java, after I carefully considered the alternatives. This is not meant to be a list of objective reasons for choosing Java, especially because language are chosen more on beliefs and assumptions, rather than facts ... </p>

<p>C++ would be fast, but a good VM gives you things for free, like a good garbage collector, memory defragmentation, and scripting support, not to mention that in C++ you often end up using seven competing string classes .NET was a really good alternative, providing faster warm-up, and a nice language to work with (C# 3.0), but I don&#39;t feel comfortable with the cross-platform support provided by the Mono development tools. The Mono VM looks good, but Monodevelop is not there yet, and with Java I get really good tools like Netbeans and Eclipse ... that are on par with Visual Studio (quality wise) ... and if I choose to use IntelliJ IDEA which is commercial, Java tools are multiplatform, and my home workstation is Linux, while my work laptop is Mac OS X. Other platforms/languages are not mainstream, and it would have been hard to find contributers (one of the reason I am using an open-source license) Other tools/libraries used: </p>

<p>QTJambi ... Java Swing is awfully ugly and slow for interfaces Antlr 3 ... for parsing formats (like Property Lists from TextMate&#39;s bundles) and later for adding Intellisense support StatusI am just starting to work on it, meaning that little to no code is available right now, but the project will flourish in the next 2 months. </p>

<p>I hope to live to my expectations and provide something of value.</p>

 summary : <p>经典ASP开发：弃VBScript而选JScript的八大理由﻿  在Active Sever Page首次发布的时候，有两种内置的语言可以让你来编写ASP脚本或HTAs：VBScript和JScript。 在ASP 1.0发布的时候，除了VBScript和JScript外并没有提供多少方法。 到了ASP 2.0， 不过，随着Windows宿主主机（ASP Host）和HTML应用程序（HTAs）的升级，这种情况得以改变。你可以通过安装第三方的工具来实现，例如Perl，但是操作系统本身并不提供内置的脚本功能。 
<br/>一些开发者已经选择了其他语言（例如PHP或者RoR），而且微软通过创建ASP.Net也开创了一个新的方向。这些都是不错的选择，但是它们都不是内置在操作系统中，而且通常情况下，能够具有共同的最底层的管理平台是非常重要的（例如有的机器上你不能安装.Net Framework）。Net尽管很强大，也有很高的入门门槛（必须是Windows XP SP2以后的版本，安装了.NET 2.0）。相比之下，一个使用VBScript或JScript编写的ASP脚本无需任何条件就可以运行在Windows 2000及以后的版本上。两者有一个共同优势就是它们都内置在Windows的asp.dll内核中。 
<br/>既然大多数ASP开发者将需要编写ASP页面脚本，那么我们就有必要来选择可以帮助你顺利完成工作的最佳语言：JScript。  
<br/>理由一：JScript被更广泛的使用根据我的经验，关于JScript是什么很多人比较模糊。简单的说来，JScript是微软对ECMA-262规范的实现，这个规范描述了一个被称作 ECMAScript的脚本语言。JavaScript和JScript是两个应用最广泛的ECMAScript规范的实现。除了不具有一些方便COM编程的属性扩展之外，JScript现在与JavaScript 1.5差不多。（JScript.NET是另一种不同的语言，超出了本文的说明范围）  
<br/>JavaScript/JScript语言被广泛应用在不同平台的不同应用程序中，最重要的应用是在浏览器中。其他厂商也已经把它们作为自动化语言（例如 Adobe）使用。换言之，JScript知识可以被利用在很多不同的地方。相比之下，VBScript则是专属于微软的，只有在使用VBScript解释器的Windows平台上的微软应用程序才会用到。  
<br/>理由二：JScript还在不断发展正如上面我所提到的，JScript是基于ECMA-262标准的。尽管当前版本的JScript等同于JavaScript 1.5，即将推出的JavaScript 2.0将是向后兼容JavaScript 1.5的。如果JavaScript 2.0被广泛的接受的话，微软也会为了维持浏览器的兼容性而将对JScript进行升级。  
<br/>相比之下，微软对于VBScript则是处于“保持不变”的状态。这意味着微软将只是修补一些在VBScript解释器中的大错误和安全漏洞；它不会去对其增加一些新的功能或对语言进行扩展。既然VBScript处于维持阶段，学习一个更有未来的语言对开发者来说更有意义。  
<br/>理由三：JScript更易学VBScript被广泛应用的一个是人们认为VBScript更易掌握。因为种种原因，对比之下人们认为JScript要难学一些。这可能是因为 JScript的C编程风格与VBScript有些不一样。但是，实际上你一旦入了门，JScript也是很容易掌握的。  
<br/>许多基本的概念是相同的（例如声明、变量和函数等）；它们只是看上有些不同而已。一旦你了解了这个语言的基础构成，使用JScript来代替VBScript来进行脚本编程是一件很简单的事情。  
<br/>和大多数Windows脚本编程作者一样，我开始使用的时候VBScript，但是我发现，虽然某些编程概念有所不同，JScript和VBScript一样容易学习。  
<br/>理由四：JScript是面向对象的JScript是作为一个面向对象语言而建立起来的。内置的数据库类型（诸如字符串和数字）本身都是具有方法的对象。例如，数字类型有一个 toString方法，来将数字作为一个文本返回，而文本类型则有toUpperCase和toLowerCase方法来以大写或小写方式返回文本。  
<br/>使用它可以很容易以最少编码方式来创建你自己的对象，看一下下面的例子：  
<br/>var options = { path: &quot;&quot;, recurse: false };这简单的一行代码就创建了一个没有名称的对象，它包含两个属性，并对属性进行了初始化。  
<br/>在VBScript中你也可以创建一个用户定义的对象，但是它要复杂的多。这个语言要求你必须创建一个类，并初始化这个类，如下面代码所示：  
<br/>Class OptionsClass
<br/>Public Path
<br/>Public Recurse
<br/>Private Sub Class_Initialize()
<br/>Path = &quot;&quot;
<br/>Recurse = False
<br/>End Sub
<br/>End Class
<br/>Dim Options
<br/>Set Options = New OptionsClass  &#39; Creates an instance of the classJScript的面向对象特点使这变成一个简单的任务；VBScript则要求编写更多的代码来完成同样的事情。  
<br/>JScript还可以让你创建一个被命名的对象（这在VBScript中强制要求的）；如果你需要多个这种对象的话，你可以简单的定义一个构造函数来定义这个对象。例如：  
<br/>function optionsObject(path, recurse) {
<br/>this.path = path;
<br/>this.recurse = recurse;
<br/>}
<br/>var options = new optionsObject(&quot;c:\\winnt&quot;, true);  // 创建一个实例对象JScript使用基于原型来进行继承，而不是基于类。使用一个对象的prototype属性，你可以扩展一个对象的行为，增加一个方法到它的prototype属性中。例如：  
<br/>Array.prototype.exists = function(item) {
<br/>for (var n = 0; n &lt; this.length; n++)
<br/>if (item == this[n]) return true;
<br/>return false;
<br/>}以上代码增加了exists方法到这个Array对象中。下面是一个你如何使用这个新方法的示例：  
<br/>var myArray = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;];  // 定义一个包含四个元素的数组
<br/>var result = myArray.exists(&quot;a&quot;);    // 返回 true
<br/>var result = myArray.exists(&quot;e&quot;);    // 返回 false从这个例子我们可以看到，JScript语言是多么灵活，无论你自己的或内置的对象，对它们扩展定制的方法是多么简单。  
<br/>理由五：JScript的正则表达式处理能力更强  </p>

<p>正则表达式是JScript本身的一个功能；它们被内置在语言的语法中。而VBScript在版本5以前并不支持正则表达式，因此，它的语法相对来说非常麻烦和糟糕。举个例子来说，如果你想使用正则表达式来检查一个输入的文本是否是电子邮件格式。在VBScript中你不得不使用New这个关键字和Set 声明来创建一个RegExp对象，然后配置它的属性来进行搜索。下面是一个例子：  
<br/>Address = &quot;foo@bar.com&quot;
<br/>Set RE = New RegExp
<br/>With RE
<br/>.Pattern = &quot;\w+@\w+\.\w+&quot;
<br/>.IgnoreCase = True
<br/>End With
<br/>Result = RE.Test(Address) 相同的JScript代码则显得更简洁。  
<br/>var address = &quot;foo@bar.com&quot;;
<br/>var RE = /\w+@\w+\.\w+/gi;
<br/>var result = RE.test(address); 上面的第二行代码创建了一个RegExp对象。如果你在代码被执行之前知道模式的话，/表达式/语法是描述一个正则表达式模式的很方便的方法。作为一种选择，你可以使用new操作来创建一个RegExp对象，如下面所示：  
<br/>var address = &quot;foo@bar.com&quot;;
<br/>var RE = new RegExp(&quot;\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+&quot;, &quot;i&quot;);
<br/>var result = RE.test(address); 如果你想在运行时描述一个正则表达式模式的话，这个语法是非常有用的。此外，JScript的RegExp对象具有一个编译方法，当重复使用它们是可以提高性能，比如在循环中使用它的时候。  
<br/>理由六：JScript的数组要强大很多数组一直是VBScript的心头之痛。它们非常不灵活，只有在这个数组在定义的时候没有指定一个固定的元素数量的时候，它才可以被重新指定大小（例如，如果你定义了一个具有五个元素的数组，那么你不能增加第六个元素到数组中）举个例子来说，看一下下面的VBScript代码：  
<br/>Dim MyArray(4) &#39; 声明一个数组可以最多包含5个元素 
<br/>MyArray(5) = &quot;Test&quot; &#39; 引发错误：这个数组只能容纳5个元素 elements 
<br/>ReDim MyArray(6) &#39; 同样引发错误：数组已被定义成固定大小 在VBScript中，你可以创建一个动态的可以修改大小的数组，但是这是一个两步过程；你不得不首先声明一个数组，然后你不得不对它重新指定大小，以来指定正确的元素数量：  
<br/>Dim MyArray() 
<br/>ReDim MyArray(5) &#39;重新定义数组大小 
<br/>MyArray(5) = &quot;Test&quot; &#39;给数组的第六个元素赋值 如果你想使用一个VBScript数组来容纳从一个循环中读出的变化数量的元素（例如一个从FileSystemObject的文件集合得到的File对象数组），你将需要定时的使用带有Preserve关键字的ReDim声明来重新定义这个数组的大小。（考虑到性能的原因，你可能不想在每一次循环完成一次后使用ReDim。）  
<br/>在JScript中，数组是一个对象类型，本质上是动态的，并提供了很多方法来操作它们。举个例子来说，push和pop方法用来追加元素到数组中和从数组中删除元素，在过程中自动调整数组的大小。JScript数组还有一个sort方法，来支持用户定义的排序功能。对于返回一个VBScript风格数组的ActiveX对象（JScript将这些称作SafeArrays或VBArrays）来说，这个数组对象有一个toArray方法来转换SafeArray数组为一个JScript数组。  
<br/>事实上，微软似乎创建了脚本运行时的Dictionary对象来克服这个VBScript数组数据类型的限制。因为我一直在使用JScript编写代码，我发现了这一点，只有一种情况下我需要Dictonary对象：从一个JScript数组返回一个SafeArray对象（奇怪的是，这个功能并不是内置支持的）。如下例所示：  
<br/>function toSafeArray(arrayObject) {
<br/>var dict = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;);
<br/>for (var n = 0; n &lt; arrayObject.length; n++)
<br/>dict.Add(arrayObject[n], &quot;&quot;);
<br/>return dict.Keys(); // Keys返回一个SafeArray 
<br/>} 当使用ActiveX组件的时候，有时候需要SafeArrays，我使用了一个与上面的类似的函数，来转换一个JScript数组为SafeArray。  
<br/>结论JScript内置在操作系统中的最好的Windows活动语言。在本篇文章中，我列举出了八个理由来说明为什么它比VBScript要强大。我认为，ASP开发者应该好好学习这个强大的语言。</p>

<p>## Obtaining a handle on the data store</p>

<p># retrieving the global app data store reference
<br/>globaldata = consumer.appdata()</p>

<p># retrieving user app data store reference
<br/>appdata = consumer.appdata(user_id)</p>

<p>## Once you have a handle on the data store you can access
<br/>## and update values like any other dictionary</p>

<p># accessing values

<p>DescriptionIf you run the mythvideo-scanner.pl script with no parameters, it will look for them in the mythconverg database. </p>

<p>The main operation of the script is scan a path looking for files that mythvideo supports. It looks for an existing entry in the database, if the plot of that entry is short (less than 20 characters) it will continue with the search, else it will skip the file. It will then determine title, season, and episode. It will then call various grabbers until the data is of a sufficient quality. </p>

 summary : <p>The .NET Accessibility Analysis Kit (NAAK) is designed to allow compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508.  This law lays out several web development guidelines to ensure web applications are accessible by people with disabilities.  Most of the guidelines apply to blindness, but others apply to deafness, color-blindness, motor impairments, and epilepsy. </p>

<p>There are numerous free and commercial products to help ensure Section 508 compliance.  Most of the free products come in the form of a browser toolbar (such as the popular WAVE toolbar: http://wave.webaim.org/toolbar) or website to which you can submit a URL for validation.  While these are excellent tools, they all share a common limitation: the accessibility checking they provide can&#39;t be accessed by an automated user interface test (such as one written in WATiN, WATiR, or Selenium).  The toolbars are designed for human use and the validation websites require that your site be deployed publicly and not include any login-based security. </p>

<p>NAAK addresses this challenge by placing a banner across the bottom of each page in your web application to notify you of any known accessibility issues (for example, an img tag without an alt attribute).  This helps ensure compliance in two ways.  First, it clearly exposes accessibility issues to each developer, QA analyst, and application reviewer.  Second, and more importantly, because it is returned as HTML with each page, it can be checked using any web user interface testing framework. </p>

<p>The one major caveat is that the tool only works with XHTML-compliant sites.  Before checking for accessibility issues, it validates the site is XHTML compliant using Josh Twist&#39;s Validator Module: http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Validator_Module.aspx. </p>

<p>NAAK was inspired by and derived it&#39;s name from another open-source project named Ruby Accessibility Analysis Toolkit (RAAKT), http://www.peterkrantz.com/raakt/wiki/.  After all, why should those Ruby guys have all the best tools and libraries?</p>

 title : The narro Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Narro really lowers the entry barrier to the software translation world by using a simple, intuitive interface and extensive checking to ensure that translation quality is kept high and people learn by translating, not by reading guidelines. I like to call it open translation because anyone can contribute, anyone can make better suggestions anytime and from anywhere. Translation maintainers benefit as well by pushing the changes to the versioning system or the other way around simply by pushing a button or executing a command. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>What is it?It&#39;s a web application that allows online software translation and coordination. </p>

<p>About itit currently supports gettext, open office sdf files, mozilla dtd files and properties/ini files, dumb gettext files, svg and phpmyadmin  it&#39;s written in php and uses mysql as a database it&#39;s built with qcodo framework it has spellchecking, entity checking and simple punctuation checking it has plugins translation suggestions are shared among the projects users can vote their preferred suggestion lots of permissions allow you to control the application rss feeds for new texts to translate, new suggestions added and context information changes it&#39;s growing fast and much more waiting to be discovered or written about Why would you need it?Well there are other applications that do similar things. Right now, Narro is different because: </p>

<p>it&#39;s written for the translation communities, not for the project owners it&#39;s written in php and mysql so it can be installed on any shared hosting it&#39;s very simple to use, allowing everyone to contribute Are you managing any translation right now? Multiply that number with ten. You could do ten times better than that! You just need to open your translations for everyone to contribute. </p>

<p>About meI&#39;m a translation coordinator for several projects. I&#39;m working with my language, Romanian. Most of the translators we have are really technical people as I am. We don&#39;t all have high linguistic knowledge. I want to take the power to translate from these people and give it to all the users of the software to be translated. This application will grow as to become a place where people would like to return to translate. By making it this simple, I&#39;m hoping that with this application you will have more software translated in less time. Quality is kept high through spellchecking, entity checking, punctuation checking, the fact that all that you translate is visible to anyone through a simple search operation and through a nice vote system. </p>

<p>Where is it?On Mozilla servers, used for translating mozilla projects: </p>

<p>https://l10n.mozilla.org/narro </p>

<p>On tradu.softwareliber.ro, a website that gathers Romanian translators: </p>

<p>http://tradu.softwareliber.ro </p>

<p>To install Narro on your own server, download it, unpack it in your webroot directory and follow the instructions from the INSTALL file. If you succeed, please post thoughts of joy, frustrations and other issues in the narro-project google group. </p>

<p>Please report any issues using the issue tracker. </p>

<p>Be sure to subscribe to the official blog for this application so you don&#39;t miss out new releases. </p>

<p>Want to help?Say so in the google group. You can help with PHP programming, testing the application and reporting issues or with web design. Narro supports themes, you know ? Some icon designs would be nice too.</p>

 summary : <p>Dominion Update: John Strobel produced a new Dominion-compatible release! Grab NavBot rev J now and give him your thanks! </p>

<p>EVE Online is a space-based MMORPG. One aspect of EVE is trading - in particular, I&#39;m talking about ferrying items from one station to another for profit (rather than market speculation). </p>

<p>NavBot is a beautifully-simple piece of code that sits in your taskbar and provides an interface through the in-game browser (IGB) that mimics conversations with in-game agents. It automatically searches for the most profitable routes, using your exported market data. </p>

<p>In the last few months NavBot has had a real overhaul from Michael Mitchell, who&#39;s added a lot of the features everyone&#39;s been asking for - allowing for tax in profit calculations, proper security route handling, minimum quantity awareness - and also a few cool new tricks such as filling the hold with multiple types of items to really maximize your profit! Check out the RecentChanges page for more info, and be sure to let Michael know if you enjoy the new version! </p>

 title : The navigator2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Navigator2.0 is the Protein Protein Interaction Networks Visualization Tool. Navigator can visualize relationships among tens of thousands of proteins as well as analyze various kind of information related to the network. By doing so, it can improve the ability to find out more meaningful interactions and proteins relevent to the protein of users&#39; interests. However, it lacks of functionality that can visualize and vividly distinguish only those proteins of special interest. Our plugin would provide a better interface for the cluster analysis.</p>

 title : The nephtali Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NephtaliBuilding on the new functional capabilities available in PHP 5.3, Nephtali provides powerful web development capabilities  within a small web framework. </p>

<p>Defining featuresFunctional style (functions are preferred over objects, many framework values are immutable.) Novel architecture makes use of micro-controllers (as opposed to the page- or front-controllers) and embedded views, cleanly separating HTML from PHP and empowering designers in the development process. Wrapper functions for PDO simplify DB work whilst maintaining control and flexibility. The framework all fits within ONE FILE. What it buys youNephtali, while small enough to fit within one file, buys you a bunch, including: </p>

<p>Automatic input validation. Automatic ouput escaping. REST-based input validation and html fragment requests are built right in, making AJAX enhancements a snap (you can choose the JS framework of your choice, although a plugin for jquery exists.) Debugging built right in to every page (while in debug mode), which allows you to view information on incoming data and any variables you choose to watch. Error handling built in to every dynamic region, and if one dynamic region has an error the rest of the page still loads normally. Dynamic regions in markup are defined by XML comments, freeing designers to use the editor of their choice. Nedit, an online code generator for Nephtali, makes it easy learn and to get things up and rolling quickly. Parallel processing of web services requests using the powerful capabilities of CURL. Installs in a couple minutes. Can add functionality to particular pages or entire directories with ease. And, much, much more :) </p>

<p>SummaryIf you’d like to try a novel approach to web development, I hope you’ll give Nephtali a try.  Cpanel appears to be approaching a release that will include PHP 5.3.1, making Nephtali more available in the wild very soon :)</p>
 title : The nepomuk-mozilla Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NEPOMUK aims at empowering individual knowledge workers to better exploit their personal information space and to maintain fruitful communication and exchange within social networks across organizational boundaries. </p>

<p>The objective of Nepomuk-Mozilla is to annotate any and all Web data (including parts of Web pages) or local files from Firefox, emails from Thunderbird and to store the annotations in the default metadata store on Mandriva, i.e KDE4 metadata store. The advantage of using a common metadata store is to share annotations and ontologies across the applications instead of having them burried into each application information system, toward a &quot;Personal Semantic Web&quot;. A first step consists of integrating Firefox and Thunderbird with the Nepomuk dbus service. A second step consists of harnessing this integration by developping addons for dealing with metadata, and to involve the community of Mozilla developers in the use of this shared desktop metadata store.</p>
 summary : <p>Nero is a fast interactive web browser that runs under Emacs. It uses &#39;lynx -dump&#39; to generate page content. Navigation is typically done via numbered links, a la Conkeror. Better-than-just-browsing interaction with various useful web services is done via elvi, a la Surfraw. Fast access to commonly used pages is available through a programmable hotlist, a la webjump. Facilities for &#39;tabbed browsing&#39; a la (insert name of browser) are available. And Nero saves pages that have been browsed for later use. </p>

 title : The nettrust Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Net Trust is a security mechanism built to inform human trust decisions as opposed to constraining technical actions. Net Trust is designed to undermine fraud and credential subversion that uses human engineering; also called pretexting.  Net Trust has a fully functioning, tested and highly usable interface.  It is  human-centered. The design is based in both human risk behaviors in the face of uncertainty and human trust behaviors. </p>

<p>The goal of Net Trust is to share information under a pseudonym, such that after an initial out-of-band introduction a person can be sure that they are sharing  with the same entity over time.  The goal is to leverage social trust for online trust, not to use technological mechanisms to create new forms of trust. </p>

<p>As of project creation, Nov 2006, there was a functioning demo with a back-end that was for demonstration purposes only. Any information entered into the database will be deleted upon server restart. The server was not in production mode; certainly you can use your own. </p>

<p>As of Nov 2007 there was a fully functional server. The code could be downloaded and used. The description of the back end was submitted for publication. </p>

<p>As of Nov 2008 there was an ambient interface designed for ambient interaction with non-traditional and predominantly stationary users. For example, elders or children surfing online at home. That work was done in collaboration with the ETHOS project, which designs interactions with seniors who use computers. http://www.ethos.indiana.edu</p>

<p>Neutron is a plugin-based Jabber bot that provides functionalities for individuals and chatrooms.  It is written in Python and uses xmpppy. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Comparing to other python bots, neutron has smallest size, and feature-full functionality, plus it runs out of the box with bundled dependencies. Only working Python required. </p>

<p>Issues? </p>

<p>Yes, a lot. Major one is still outdated and buggy version of XMPPPY. One of the ways is to replace it with Gajim&#39;s fork, which is up-to-date, and both users of Neutron and Gajim should benefit. </p>

<p>Workflow? Any? </p>

<p>NOTE TO KDE 4 USERSAlthough KDE 4 can execute KDE 3 SuperKaramba widgets, nextShows is really borked (at least with KDE 4.1.x). For some unknown reasons many things aren&#39;t working as expected. I plan to port nextShows to Plasma (Edit: finally it won&#39;t be a plasmoid thanks to the poor documentation/tutorials on KDE websites) but I can&#39;t give any date therefore it&#39;ll be out &quot;when it&#39;s ready&quot;©. </p>

<p>DescriptionA desktop widget (aka applet) for SuperKaramba that displays the coming air dates for your favorite TV shows. </p>

<p>RequirementsCurrent stable release requires: </p>

<p>KDE v3.5.x (if you use an older KDE release, make sure SuperKaramba is up to date) Python v2.5 or later (previous versions WON&#39;T work) Qt v4.3.1 or later PyQt v4.3.1 or later </p>

<p>&quot;Haml is a markup language that‘s used to cleanly and simply describe the XHTML of any web document, without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ERB, and ASP. However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding XHTML into the template, because it is actually an abstract description of the XHTML, with some code to generate dynamic content.&quot; </p>

<p>In other words, NHaml is an external DSL for XHTML. It’s primary qualities are it’s simplicity, terseness, performance and that it outputs nicely formatted XHTML. Additionally, the NHaml view engine provides support for Rails style layouts and partials and ships w</p>

 title : The nodefinder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In a dynamic computing environment such as EC2 it is useful to have Erlang nodes automatically discover each other.  This project contains 3 (+1) strategies for doing so:  </p>

<p>combonodefinder: detects EC2 hostname and dispatches either to ec2nodefinder or nodefinder as appropriate. nodefinder: multicast UDP based.  a node group corresponds to a multicast ip/port combination.  multicast is not supported on EC2. ec2nodefinder: ec2-describe-instances based.  a node group corresponds to a  security group.  only works on EC2. s3nodefinder: S3 based. a node group corresponds to an S3 bucket.  works for WAN discovery. For LAN setups (EC2 and non-EC2), I recommend combonodefinder. </p>

<p>For WAN setups (without multicast routing), s3nodefinder is the only choice. </p>

<p>Another Dukes of Erl release.</p>
 summary : <p>The engine is a framework that simplifies application development. There is a growing set of core modules designed to be flexible to use for web-portal development or portals inside of portals. The focus with the structural parts is minimalism.</p>
 title : The nodes-ngin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The noisereduction Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A new fuzzy filter is presented for the noise reduction of images corrupted with additive noise. The filter consists of two stages. The first stage computes a fuzzy derivative for eight different directions. The second stage uses these fuzzy derivatives to perform fuzzy smoothing by weighting the contributions of neighboring pixel values. Both stages are based on fuzzy rules which make use of membership functions. The filter can be applied iteratively to effectively reduce heavy noise. In particular, the shape of the membership functions is adapted according to the remaining noise level after each iteration, making use of the distribution of the homogeneity in the image. A statistical model for the noise distribution can be incorporated to relate the homogeneity to the adaptation scheme of the membership functions. Experimental results are obtained to show the feasibility of the proposed approach. These results are also compared to other filters by numerical measures and visual inspection.</p>

<p>nose-django is a plugin for nose (http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/) that allows easy testing of django projects. It works by creating a test database (or schema) before the test run starts and installing the apps in INSTALLED_APPS into the test database. Then, in your tests, you can use your models normally. After each test run, the test database (or schema) is dropped.</p>
 title : The nose-trestle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Trestle is a nose plugin that enables you to write testable documentation for web apps (or shell commands, but more on that later). </p>

<p>To use trestle, write a reStructured Text document using a set of special directives to indicate the fixtures to be used for testing (including the http or mock http client), each request to be sent via the client, and the expected response from the application under test. </p>

<p>A simple trestle test document might look like this:: </p>

<p>  Frog: A web service for doing things with frogs
<br/>  -----------------------------------------------</p>

<p>  .. fixtures :: frog_fixtures</p>

<p>  Frog is a web service for doing things with frogs.
<br/>  
<br/>  You can list the available frogs. 
<br/>  
<br/>  .. request :: List available frogs</p>

<p>     GET /frogs
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  The response is in a plain-text format.
<br/>  
<br/>  .. response ::
<br/>    
<br/>     bullfrog
<br/>     poison dart
<br/>     treefrog
<br/>     ...
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  You can find out if something is a frog.</p>

<p>  .. request :: Get bullfrog details</p>

<p>     GET /frogs/bullfrog
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  If the requested term is a frog, details about the frog will be returned.
<br/>  
<br/>  .. response ::</p>

<p>     Bullfrogs are really big frogs.
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.</p>

<p>  .. request :: Get details for a non-frog</p>

<p>     GET /frogs/toad
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  .. response ::</p>

<p>     404 ...
<br/>     ...
<br/>     
<br/>     &quot;toad&quot; is not a frog.
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  You can create frogs.</p>

<p>  .. request :: Create a frog</p>

<p>     POST /frogs/pouched+frog
<br/>     A pouched frog camouflages itself to look like dead leaves.
<br/>  ..</p>

<p>  .. response ::</p>

<p>     201 Created
<br/>     ...</p>

<p>     ...
<br/>  ..Trestle directives ^^^^^^    Fixtures for a trestle test file are set like so: </p>

<p>  .. fixtures:: aboutA fixtures directive is required in every document to be tested. The directive must name a python module. The module must include the following attribute:    client </p>

<p>A client application to be called with methods .get(), .post(), 
<br/>.put(), etc. Each method must accept at least the arguments url and 
<br/>data, and may accept others but may not require 
<br/>them. paste.fixtures.TestApp is such a client, though it natively 
<br/>supports only .get() and .post(). </p>

<p>And may include the following functions: </p>

<p>setup_all(cls) </p>

<p>Setup fixture run before the first request. </p>

<p>teardown_all(cls) </p>

<p>Teardown fixture run after the last request. </p>

<p>setup_each(inst) </p>

<p>Setup fixture run before each request. </p>

<p>teardown_each(inst) </p>

<p>Teardown fixture run after each request. </p>

<p>Tests in a trestle document consist of a `.. request` directive, followed by one or more `.. response directives. The .. request` directive defines the request to be sent to the web app under test, using the client defined in the fixtures module.    A simple request directive looks like this: </p>

<p>  .. request:: A simple get</p>

<p>    GET /foo/bar
<br/>  ..If the request is a POST or PUT that includes data to be sent, include that data in the body of the request, after the request line:: </p>

<p>  .. request:: A post</p>

<p>    POST /foo/bar
<br/>    a=1&amp;b=2
<br/>  ..The response expected to be returned to the client is defined using a response block:: </p>

<p>  .. response::</p>

<p>    Ponies!!1!
<br/>  ..The testing process is simple: each request is executed using the client defined in the fixtures module, and each expected response following that request in the text is compared against the actual response. If all responses match, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails. </p>

<p>Passing examples are given a pleasing green  background, failures a sinister red. Details of the failed match are included following the failed example. </p>

<p>Fixture commandsAt times it may be necessary to execute a unique fixture before executing a request. While it&#39;s usually better to make the test depend only on public apis and not internal details or externalities, sometimes (e.g. when testing time-dependent operations) that isn&#39;t possible or reasonable. For those times, use the :setup: argument to the request. The body of the exec argument will be evaluated in the context of the fixture module before running the request. Naturally, there is also a :teardown: argument, which will be executed after the request is run and the response processed. Here&#39;s an example: </p>

<p>  .. request:: Get something special
<br/>     :setup: client.set_special(true)
<br/>     :teardown: client.set_special(false)</p>

<p>     GET /special
<br/>  ..   </p>

<p>Shell examplesTrestle also supports shell examples. When a shell example is executed, the shell command given is executed, and the stdout produced by the command is compared to the body of the `..shell` example using the normal doctest output checker. A simple shell example looks like this: </p>

<p> .. shell :: echo &quot;Hello&quot;</p>

<p>    Hello
<br/> ..Trestle is most useful in writing testable documentation for ReST services.</p>

<p>Backend pagination Backend column sorting Backend row selection (number of total rows) Overview file field images (cropped) Added gmap.field.php Added multi.field.php Added checkbox.field.php</p>
 title : The nova-lib Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NOVA is a code library for LISP programmers building decision support tools for software project managers. </p>

<p>NOVA supports a set of USC COCOMO-family models. These models offer predictions for: </p>

<p>How long it will take to build a software; measured in elapsed months; How many months of effort are required during those elapsed months (so your team size is effort/months); How many defects will be introduced or removed from your software; Number of projects threats; i.e how prone is your software to schedule overruns due to poor management decisions.  In standard practice, these models are tuned to local conditions using historical data. NOVA is an experiment in an alternate approach. When historical data is absent, NOVA uses AI search methods to find policies that are useful across the space of possible tunings. </p>

<p>NOVA was written by the LISP gang at West Virginia University&#39;s CSEE department, from a code base initialized by Tim Menzies (http://menzies.us).</p>

 title : The ns2-multihop-relay Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionRecently, IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay network is proposed to increase data rate and coverage of the IEEE 802.16e networks. The Relay Station (RS) is introduced to relay the data from MR-BS to SS/MS or from SS/MS to MR-RS.  We have studied the research area for a whole, and we proposed some improvements that could decrease the congestion opportunity of non-transparent RS using distributed scheduling.  We have to modify the NIST WiMAX module which is implemented under the NS-2 in order to test the correctness of our proposed scheme. Subversion and Google-code-hosting are used to manage the project versions, thus we could be easy to modify the NIST module to support the functions of RS.</p>

 title : The nsimpledb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Amazon just announced its SimpleDB online database web service offering. </p>

<p>This sounds very interesting - but there are three drawbacks to it. 1. Currently (Jan 08) it´s only in limited beta, so not everyone can actually get his/her hands on it. 2. It´s solely an  online service, so you can´t play around with it while not being connected to the internet. 3. From that also follows you´re forced to use different APIs if you want to store data online as well as offline. </p>

<p>To help overcome these drawbacks, I intend to develop an offline version of SimpleDB called NSimpleDB (short for &quot;.NET SimpleDB&quot;) which sports the same API as Amazon´s database and also can be used just on your desktop. </p>

<p>If you want to give NSimpleDB a try and download the sources, please be sure to read the SourceCodeInstallationNotes first. </p>

<p>For a documentation of NSimpleDB see Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of my blog series. </p>

<p>And if you´re interested in the static architectural quality of NSimpleDB, have a look at the NDepend analysis report. </p>

 title : The nsscache Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>nsscache is a Python library and a commandline frontend to that library that synchronises a local NSS cache against a remote directory service, such as LDAP. </p>

<p>As soon as you have more than one machine in your network, you want to share usernames between those systems.  Linux administrators have been brought up on the convention of LDAP or NIS as a directory service, and /etc/nsswitch.conf, nss_ldap.so, and nscd to manage their nameservice lookups. </p>

<p>Even small networks will have experienced intermittent name lookup failures, such as a mail  receiver sometimes returning &quot;User not found&quot; on a mailbox destination because of a slow socket over a congested network, or erratic cache behaviour by nscd.  To combat this problem, we have separated the network from the NSS lookup codepath, instead u</p>

 title : The nstextviewwithmathextensions Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is an application framework that provides extended functionality for the NSTextView class.  The specific additions include evaluation of inline equations such as &#39;10+16*(12-10)&#39; and conversions for natural language units such as &#39;12 inches&#39;.   </p>

<p>When the cursor (input) location is changed within the extended text view object the framework scans the nearby text of the previous input location to identify equations and unit strings.  When identified these strings are signified to the user by a dashed and colored underline (green for equations and blue for units).  The user of a Macintosh system can then evaluate such equations or choose a conversion from a list of possible conversions by invoking a context sensitive menu by Cmd+Clicking on the appropriate region of text. </p>

<p>When applying unit conversions certain attempts are made to maintain the &#39;natural language&#39; aspect of writing.  For example, the string &#39;1 quart&#39; is converted into &#39;1/4 gallon&#39; but not &#39;0.25 gallons&#39;.  Additionally, when presenting unit conversions very unlikely conversions will not be presented, such as conversions of &#39;3.2 miles&#39; into centimeters. </p>

<p>The framework is designed to be localizable.  XCode project files included in this project include the framework source code, a modified version of the Apple TextEdit program which utilizes the framework, and an editor for creating localized databases of conversion names and factors.</p>

 title : The nunitgridrunner Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NUnitGridRunnerNote: I&#39;ve given up on this project as I&#39;ve found that JetBrain&#39;s Team City provides a viable option. Cruise also provides some grid processing but not as good. </p>

<p>Note: NUnitGridRunner is currently being rewriten to replace the Alchemi framework with a native grid processing framework giving developers more feedback and control of grid loading. The binary release uses the Alchemi framwork. </p>

<p>NUnitGridRunner is a NUnit test runner that runs tests using grid processing (a form of distributed computing) on multiple idle network boxes. This allows developers and build boxes to run tests with the combined processing power of a computer farm as if running locally. A virtual build farm for tests. Written for slow NUnit tests (typically automated user acceptance tests). </p>

<p>The grid processing is provided by a Archemi .Net Grid Computing Framework network of PCs. NUnitGridRunner is an application that loads an application with &#39;threads&#39; onto the Alchmi Grid so developer&#39;s and build boxes may share the Grid. NUnitGridRunner does not impose any appication specific needs on the Grid Computing Framework so it may also be shared for other purposes, or other product teams. </p>

<p>This project is currently under initial development so expect volatility. Anything, including the command line, may change at any time. </p>

 title : The oauth-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OAuth PluginThis is the beginning of a plugin for implementing OAuth Providers in Rails applications. </p>

<p>See the OAuth specs at: </p>

<p>http://oauth.net/core/1.0/ </p>

<p>and the OAuth site at: </p>

<p>http://oauth.net </p>

<p>NOTE We&#39;ve moved to github  </p>

<p>http://github.com/pelle/oauth-plugin/tree/master </p>

<p>InstallationYou need to install the oauth gem (0.2.1) which is the core OAuth ruby library. It will NOT work on any previous version of the gem. </p>

<p>sudo gem install oauthTo install the plugin in your rails application. Go to you rails application directory and type: </p>

<p>./script/plugin install  git://github.com/pelle/oauth-plugin.gitThe Generator currently creates code (in particular views) that only work in Rails 2. </p>

<p>It should not be difficult to manually modify the code to work on Rails 1.2.x </p>

<p>I think the only real issue is that the views have .html.erb extensions. So these could theoretically just be renamed to .rhtml. </p>

<p>Please let me know if this works and I will see if I can make the generator conditionally create .rhtml for pre 2.0 versions of RAILS. </p>

<p>Also have a look at this quick start tutorial I wrote How to turn your rails site into an OAuth Provider </p>

<p>StatusChangelog </p>

<p>What is done: </p>

<p>Create and authenticate RequestTokens Exchange RequestToken for an AccessToken Simple http wrapper built into RequestToken. This has been refactored to fit into the ActiveResource way of doing http requests. Supports query and authorization headers Generators to create Token AR models Generators to create OAuth consumer and provider controllers Uses the new official oauth gem Still todo: </p>

<p>Improve error handling (it&#39;s virtually non existant) Generator to create OAuth consumer controllers Integrate with ActiveResource by including AccessToken support in the ActiveResource::Connection class. UsageThere is now a generator which allows you to quickly create an oauth provider. </p>

<p>./script/generate oauth_providerThis does require an acts_as_authenticated type of plugin. Such as restful_authentication or the cool new restful_open_id_authentication module. </p>

<p>RoutesYou need to add the following to your routes (config/routes.rb) </p>

<p>map.oauth &#39;/oauth&#39;,:controller=&gt;&#39;oauth&#39;,:action=&gt;&#39;index&#39;
<br/>map.authorize &#39;/oauth/authorize&#39;,:controller=&gt;&#39;oauth&#39;,:action=&gt;&#39;authorize&#39;
<br/>map.request_token &#39;/oauth/request_token&#39;,:controller=&gt;&#39;oauth&#39;,:action=&gt;&#39;request_token&#39;
<br/>map.access_token &#39;/oauth/access_token&#39;,:controller=&gt;&#39;oauth&#39;,:action=&gt;&#39;access_token&#39;
<br/>map.test_request &#39;/oauth/test_request&#39;,:controller=&gt;&#39;oauth&#39;,:action=&gt;&#39;test_request&#39;User ModelAdd the following lines to your user model: </p>

<p>has_many :client_applications
<br/>has_many :tokens, :class_name=&gt;&quot;OauthToken&quot;,:order=&gt;&quot;authorized_at desc&quot;,:include=&gt;[:client_application]Migrate databaseThe database is defined in: 	 </p>

<p>db/migrate/XXX_create_oauth_tables.rbRun them as any other normal migration in rails with: </p>

<p>rake db:migrateRSpecThe generator installs a collection of RSpec (http://rspec.info) specs instead of normal unit_tests. If you don&#39;t use RSpec (and really why aren&#39;t you?) feel free to remove the spec folder. 	 If you would like to contribute regular unit tests I will accept them with a smile. </p>

<p>Protecting your actionsI recommend that you think about what your users would want to provide access to and limit oauth for those only. For example in a CRUD controller you may think about if you want to let consumer applications do the create, update or delete actions. For your application this might make sense, but for others maybe not. </p>

<p>If you want to give oauth access to everything a registered user can do, just replace the filter you have in your controllers with: </p>

<p>before_filter :login_or_oauth_required	 If you want to restrict consumers to the index and show methods of your controller do the following: </p>

<p>before_filter :login_required,:except=&gt;[:show,:index]
<br/>before_filter :login_or_oauth_required,:only=&gt;[:show,:index]If you have an action you only want used via oauth: </p>

<p>before_filter :oauth_requiredAll of these places the tokens user in current_user as you would expect. It also exposes the following methods: </p>

<p> current_token - for accessing the token used to authorize the current request  current_client_application - for accessing information about which consumer is currently accessing your request </p>

<p>You could add application specific information to the OauthToken and ClientApplication model for such things as object level access control, billing, expiry etc. Be creative and you can create some really cool applications here.</p>

 summary : <p>A proposSauvegarder régulièrement les données est un réflexe à avoir car le monde numérique peut être impitoyable: imaginez toutes vos photos depuis 5 ans disparaissant suite à un disque dur cassé ! </p>

<p>Le mieux est d&#39;automatiser cette tâche, aussi j&#39;ai développé OBIRAN - Outil de Backup Incrémental en Ruby (&#39;Obiran Kenobi, vous êtes notre seul espoir&#39; (Princesse Leila, Starwars IV) ). </p>

<p>Ce script en langage Ruby permet d&#39;effectuer des sauvegardes incrémentales en utilisant rsync, ssh et cp. </p>

<p>Rsync permet de synchroniser deux répertoires. ssh donne les accès à distance. cp -al est utilisé pour faire des copies de répertoires Hard-Link en anglais sans perdre trop de place. </p>

<p>PrincipeIncrémental ?Ce script est très fortement inspiré des idées de synchronisation trouvées sur les pages suivantes: </p>

<p>Backups using rsync par Kevin Korb Easy Automated Snapshot-Style Backups with Linux and Rsync par Mike Rubel </p>

<p>Le principe est de faire des sauvegardes incrémentales, c&#39;est à dire ne sauvegarder que les différences d&#39;un backup à l&#39;autre. Ainsi la place consommée est bien moindre: </p>

<p>  tifauve@einstein:~/backup/obiran/turing$ du -shc *
<br/>  43G     20061016_170631
<br/>  514M    20061016_204921
<br/>  82M     20061017_205021
<br/>  397M    20061018_200001
<br/>  1,1G    20061018_202601
<br/>  45G     totalDans l&#39;exemple ci-dessous, la première sauvegarde prend 43Go mais l&#39;espace occupé par les suivantes est bien inférieure. Cela permet de faire des sauvegardes fréquentes et complètes souvent. </p>

<p>Un peu de magieToutefois, ce qui est reproché à l&#39;incrémental en général est le risque de perdre la première sauvegarde sur laquel sont basées les autres. Que neni ! </p>

<p>En effet dans notre cas on utilise la commande cp -al qui permet de faire des &#39;hard-link&#39;, similaires aux symlinks (le célèbre ln -s). A l&#39;inverse des symlinks qui crée un lien vers un fichier, le hard-link (ln -li pour les intimes) crée deux liens vers un seul et même fichier: supprimer un lien n&#39;a aucune incidence sur l&#39;autre lien et le fichier. </p>

<p>La commande cp -al permet donc de dupliquer deux répertoires sans occuper de place supplémentaire. En reprenant l&#39;exemple ci-dessus, on peut constater que les répertoires sont en fait presque de la même taille (le dernier est plus gros suite à des changements importants) </p>

 title : The objective-c-caml-bridge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of this project is to provide access to Mac OS X&#39;s APIs from OCaml. The project focuses on the set of APIs referred to as &quot;Cocoa&quot;, that is APIs based on Objective C artefacts (classes, objects, protocols, methods). With such access to Cocoa&#39;s APIs, it is expected that OCaml programmers would be able to design, develop and build native MacOSX applications with ease. </p>

<p>Some features are explicitly out of scope: - general support of C-type apis (structs) - general support for Objective C (this project is targetted at Mac OS X) - platforms different from MacOSX </p>

<p>The targetted user is an intermediate level developer, at ease with all of OCaml constructs (including modules, classes, labels) and with Cocoa programming. </p>

<p>Update: 2008-03-08. As of r61, I am abandoning the idea of using labeled arguments to encode multiple versions of a method (e.g. a: and a:b:). Too many collisions are forcing me to leave out a bunch of methods that may actually be needed... </p>

<p>Update: 2008-02-27. Major update of the stub generation; cleaner and user-code is somewhat less verbose. Still no good way to handle mutually recursive classes such as NSObject and NSString.</p>

 title : The objectiveresource Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Inspired by ActiveResource and based the Core Data stack. </p>

<p>Ideally you&#39;d create a custom Core Data persistent store, but since you can only create custom atomic stores that isn&#39;t possible. I don&#39;t want to pull the entire database down every time, and I don&#39;t want to pepper my code with NSURLConnection code. I decided to write a collection of custom classes which mimic the interface of Core Data. </p>

<p>The project also features a suite of tests to verify the behavior. Tests might rely on a database not included in the project. I&#39;ll write supporting code for the test suite that will load the Rails stack (included in Leopard) and host it using RubyCocoa and WEBrick. </p>

 summary : <p>Okay, it&#39;s pretty easy to instantiate objects in Java through standard reflection. However there are many cases where you need to go beyond what reflection provides.  </p>

<p>For example, if there&#39;s no public constructor, you want to bypass the constructor code, or set final fields.  </p>

<p>There are numerous clever (but fiddly) approaches to getting around this and this library provides a simple way to get at them. </p>

 title : The obsearch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Synopsis: </p>

<p>Similarity search is required in many areas. For example, music matching and binary program matching require a similarity search engine. Nowadays, it is common to hear news of projects like &quot;photosynth&quot; that heavily rely on similarity search. OBSearch is a similarity search engine that can help you to create an interesting and new application! </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Single-computer or distributed mode. (1) 	 </p>

<p>Designed to handle efficiently heavy objects (trees, graphs). </p>

<p>Code generation for each primitive datatype (byte, short, int, long, float, double) for maximum performance. The API is compact and easy to understand. Stability and scalability: OBSearch&#39;s secondary storage backend is Oracle&#39;s Berkeley DB. An extensive test suite makes sure that data integrity is preserved.   </p>

<p>Cutting edge:  We strive to put together the latest algorithms the scientific community has to offer. For example, we use the K-means++ algorithm in one of our indexes. </p>

<p> OBSearch can live on top of any B-Tree (or anything that allows range queries for one dimension). For example, Amazon&#39;s cloud service SimpleDB http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342335011 OBSearch&#39;s homepage is: http://obsearch.berlios.de/  </p>

 title : The ocaml-annot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the repository for Annot, a tool to lookup annotations for Objective Caml source code. The main purpose is to lookup the type annotation for a given identifier in an OCaml source file from within an editor. Annot works by taking the line and column of the identifier and looking up the information in an annotations file produced by the OCaml compiler: </p>

<p>$ annot -type 57 5 main.annot
<br/>string -&gt; (in_channel -&gt; &#39;a) -&gt; &#39;aThe code above looks up the type annotation for an identifier in main.ml, at line 57, column 5. The invocation of this command is typically bound to a key in an editor rather than invoked explicitly in a shell. </p>

 title : The octopy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Inspired by Google&#39;s MapReduce and Starfish for Ruby, octo.py is a fast-n-easy MapReduce implementation for Python. </p>

<p>Octo.py doesn&#39;t aim to meet all your distributed computing needs, but its simple approach is amendable to a large proportion of parallelizable tasks. If your code has a for-loop, there&#39;s a good chance that you can make it distributed with just a few small changes. If you&#39;re already using Python&#39;s map() and reduce() functions, the changes needed are trivial! </p>

<p>It is not an exact clone of the Big-G&#39;s MapReduce, but I&#39;m guessing that you aren&#39;t operating a Google-like cluster with a distributed Google File System and can&#39;t use a MapReduce clone. Instead, the scope of the project is more akin to Starfish, running on an ad-hoc cluster of computers. The data semantics bears closer resemblance to MapReduce though, except the part about the ordering of intermediate results. </p>

 summary : <p>ABOUT JAWAHAR NAVODAYA VIDYALAYA SCHEME </p>

<p>National integration should inform the activity of the Government and the people alike. One way of bringing this about is to orient the education of boys and girls towards integration at an early age. One important vehicle of integration is the curriculum adumbrated in the New Education Policy. The core curriculum would naturally and inevitably contain inputs from all regions all the country and contribution from the states in ample measure. In mobility of students across the country is another crucial factor. Another important measure is the opportunity afforded to students at an impressionable age, to live and learn along with their peers from states other than their own and to get acquainted with, and motivated by experiences of National Integration in action.  </p>

<p>It has been well accepted that children with special talent or aptitude should be provided opportunities to proceed at a faster pace than others. Such children are in fact found in all section of people and in all areas including the backward. However, good quality education has been available only to well-to-do sections of society, the poor have been left out. Keeping in view these considerations, the Education Commission (1964-66) had recommended selection of a certain percentage of schools as pace setter institutions. But due to the reasons it is not practicable to select schools, institutions within the existing system for a pace-setter improvement program  and therefore :- in accordance to the National Policy of Education (1986) Government of India started Navodaya Vidyalaya  (Presently known as Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya) on an average one in each district, during the seventh five year plan. The constituted board for the purpose, aims for establishing of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas are to serve the objective of excellence to develop their full potential and facilitate the process of school improvement. </p>

<p>Future Expansion Plans : 1. In His telecast to the Nation on 22 March, 1998, Honorable Prime Minister of India Proposed twenty fold expansion of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya scheme. 2. Proposed to cover 568 District during 10th Plan. 3. Award to the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas in the CBSE public examination as well as to the outstanding teachers of the JNVs for their meritorious services to the children and to the Nation. </p>

<p>EXSISTANCE OF JAWAHAR NAVODAYA VIDYALAYA RAISEN 
<br/>In the above reference, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Raisen came to existence as Co-Educational Residential School during 23rd March 1992 at Bari, a place 100km away from the capital city Bhopal on the National Highway No. 12 (Jaipur-Bhopal-Jabalpur Road). The nearest railway stations  to reach Bari are : Pipariya-65km, Itarsi (via Hoshangabad)- 75km, Bhopal-100km and Jabalpur- 265km. However, frequent buses ply between Bhopal-Jabalpur, Itarsi-Hoshangabad-Baktara-Bari-Bareli, and Pipariya-Bareli-Bari.  </p>

<p>FINANCIAL MATTER : Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Raisen is fully financed by the Government of India through an autonomous organization - Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD).  </p>

<p>VIDYALAYA MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (VMC) : The Vidyalaya Management committee works as advisory body to supervise general functioning of the Vidyalaya.  more.........    </p>

 summary : <p>AboutI ordered a Nokia N800 a day or two ago, and thought &quot;man, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to be able to use Google Maps around town even when this thing doesn&#39;t have an internet connection?&quot;  Well, a few hours and ~200 lines of code later: the answer is definitely &quot;heck yeah&quot;.  =P </p>

<p>This tool downloads and builds a version of Google Maps that will run completely off your own system, with no internet connection, HTTP servers, etc. required, and uses the same web2.0 UI you&#39;re familiar with.  If your device has a web browser, you&#39;re pretty much good to go. </p>

<p>DownloadingAssuming you have subversion installed, run the following command: </p>

<p>$ svn checkout http://ogmaps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ogmapsThis will create a directory ogmaps and download all the relevant files. </p>

<p>InstructionsChange to the directory created above. run: python ogmaps.py &quot;plano, tx&quot; (replace &quot;plano, tx&quot; with wherever) while your internet connection is working open the file &quot;ogmap.html&quot; in your web browser (later, when your internet connection is down) FAQHow does this work?The script downloads all the HTML, Javascript and images Google Maps uses, and saves them to your hard drive.  It then, through the magic of regular expressions and BeautifulSoup, transmographies the files as necessary to use the data it downloaded a moment earlier. </p>

<p>How much drive space does this use?That depends on how many locations you download, but it should be less than 10MB per site.  It&#39;s smart enough to know what it has and hasn&#39;t downloaded already, and not re-request the same information.  It downloads data for all zoom levels, but to avoid exponential growth only looks at a fixed pixel radius (~3072px / 12 tiles) around whatever point you&#39;re looking at. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this illegal / against Google&#39;s TOC / stealing?I doubt it.  Just don&#39;t use the images for anything other than personal use and you should be fine.  But if this project disappears suddenly, check out my blog at http://kered.org/blog for where I&#39;ll re-host it. </p>

<p>Will this work on my N770/N800/N810?Heck if I know.  I&#39;m still waiting for the FedEx guy! </p>

<p>How can I help?To help the project, file a bug for any errors or feature requests you have, and/or join the list.  To help me personally, check out my company&#39;s site: http://allurstuff.com (it&#39;s basically craigslist fused with google maps).</p>

<p>http://ojay.othermedia.org </p>

<p>INTRODUCTIONOjay is a JavaScript programming interface that wraps the Yahoo! User Interface library. It aims to make code easier to read and write, by allowing more sentence-like OO syntax and minimizing repetition. </p>

<p>Further information and docs are available on the Ojay site: http://ojay.othermedia.org </p>

<p>HELP? FEEDBACK?Leave a message in the discussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/ojay-talk/      </p>

<p>DEVELOPMENTIf you&#39;re checking this code out from the repository, you&#39;ll need to build the library from the source files (contained in the /source directory). To do this, you&#39;ll need Ruby installed. You can get Ruby for any platform from their web site: </p>

<p>http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ </p>

<p>You&#39;ll also need the Jake gem to generate build files, and the staticmatic gem to view the doc site and run tests. </p>

<p>gem install jake
<br/>gem install staticmaticOnce you&#39;ve got Ruby installed, open a command prompt in the root directory (one level up from /source) and type &#39;jake&#39;. That command will combine and compress the source files and place them in the /build directory. Note that you must build the library from within the Subversion working copy, as the build process uses SVN to extract version information. </p>

<p>To start a server for the docs/test site, type </p>

<p>staticmatic preview site </p>

<p>The site is then available at http://localhost:3030, and the test suite at http://localhost:3030/test/</p>
 summary : <p>OJS is a library that allows you to deal with individual &#39;components&#39; (like a login form, a div representing a comment, a grid, etc.) on a page as objects, with classes, inheritance and all that OOP goodness. </p>

<p>StateALPHA 0.000000001 </p>

<p>IntroductionFor a nice introduction, see WhyOJS and Guide. </p>

<p>For a dense and jargon-filled introduction, see below. </p>

<p>Executive SummaryOstensibly, this simply means separating the &quot;behavior&quot; layer of your page from the structural HTML itself, much like CSS separates the visual presentation layer. The idea is in line with other approaches to &quot;unobtrusive javascript&quot; (google it). </p>

<p>OJS does this in a way more familiar to object-oriented (desktop) GUI development. It allows you to define controller classes, which receive events from a particular group of elements on the page, perform high level operations with the group as a whole, and store relevant state information. This is a much more maintainable and modular approach than inline javascript, and even the &quot;event selector&quot; approach (a.k.a. Behavior.js) which, although a big step up, still doesn&#39;t make it easy to deal with &quot;components&quot; on the page as a cohesive unit. </p>

<p>OJS makes extensive use of classes and inheritance to provide common functionality out of the box. For instance, if all your form controllers inherit from the built-in FormController class, validation, loading indicators and error notification methods will become available and you can deal with them in a neatly consistent fashion. You could also inherit from AjaxFormController instead ( a subclass of FormController) which simply performs an AJAX request instead of refreshing the page (and provides additional callbacks for handling responses). </p>

<p>To make all of this practical, OJS also provides a number of tools (available in a rails plugin): </p>

<p>1) The OJS Translator allows you to write your JavaScript? code using actual class declarations (&quot;class Foo : Bar { ... }&quot;) with super() calls and class method inheritance. It also provides some much-needed syntax sugar, such as Ruby-style string interpolation ( #&quot;Hello #{user.name}&quot; ), unless statements (negated if), #foreach (simple macro for efficient native loops, when prototype&#39;s .each() is needless overhead). </p>

<p>2) JavaScript event-dispatching, which is a very efficient way of handling events for a large number of elements on a page without extensive processing on page load (&quot;event selector&quot; approaches can noticeably slow down page load when applicable and dealing with large pages). The event-dispatcher uses event-bubbling and an HTML ID naming convention to handle any number of events with just one page-wide event listener. </p>

<p>3) The OJS Loader, which dynamically creates packages from many JS files (OJS tends to encourage many small JS, specialized files, instead of a few monolithic ones), limiting JS-file requests to the server to 3 per page, while balancing needless re-downloading and caching. </p>

<p>4) A set of Rails view helpers that make it easy to write HTML using the ID conventions. (They also provide functionality similar to Rails&#39; built-in form helpers, such as pre-filling field values in an edit form) </p>

<p>5) (Coming Soon™) HTML templates that can be shared between Ruby and Javascript (i.e., you can create HTML using just Javascript, from the same template Ruby uses on the server side without an AJAX call). They work within RHTML and the above-mentioned view helpers, but only support a very minimal amount of &#39;smarts&#39;.</p>

The Ollie philosophy is the create a core editor engine that can be embedded and re-used in multiple projects using multiple toolkits and possibly multiple languages. </p>

<p>AbstractThis web application will provide project management tools that help with the development of open source projects.  It will be a web application and will utilize Seam, and Java Server Faces. </p>

<p>DescriptionAn application is needed that keeps track of resources and how they may or are assigned to use-case development.  I think the use-case to developer scoping is very efficient.  It gives each developer to do many different types of developer tasks and also introduces him to the various areas of the system architecture.  I&#39;ve used this method of project management and it&#39;s effective.  </p>

<p>Also, a project management tool that tracks iterations, time, resources, and use-case development would be a valuable tool for estimating work on large Java EE projects. </p>

<p>We have not determined the best approach to conveying requirements.  Another project http://code.google.com/p/leader uses Ruby on Rails to model a prototype for the application and it&#39;s code is part of the project source.  This may be too much, but the goal is to provide understanding for the developers to make progress. </p>

<p>If this project gets larger and more popular, we will obtain more enterprise tooling and that will help with management of work and direction.</p>

 title : The online-note Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>我一直在使用 NoteZilla 做桌面便签, 记录些事情非常方便. NoteZilla 作为一个桌面便签软件, 可以说已经做的很到位了, 很多非常不错的功能, 随便列举一些, 如: 便签分类, 窗口绑定, 定义 tag, 高级搜索, 定时提醒, 随机背景色, 全局快捷键支持等等. </p>

<p>比较可惜的是 NoteZilla 是单机软件, 不能共享数据(只提供一个利用监听端口传送数据的功能, 不是很方便), 这方面不如 Google Notebook, 可以把数据保存在网络上, 只要登录就能取回数据, 但 Google Notebook 也有缺点, 就是不管是在站点中还是使用插件, 都离不开浏览器, 这样对于便签软件来说便捷性大打折扣. </p>

<p>基于对以上两个软件的不满, OnlineNote 的雏形诞生了, 她将集成两个软件的优点, 摒弃不足, 初步设想可能只做一些最基本的功能, 客户端使用 Adobe Air 技术实现, 用户需要进行安装 Adobe Air Runtime, 后台数据保存和处理使用 PHP + MySQL. </p>

<p>本人水平有限, Air 也是初学, 写这个软件有两个目的, 一是创建一个适合自己使用(符合自己使用习惯或自己需要的一些特殊功能)的便签软件, 二是利用这个项目深入学习 Air 这个划时代的将来必定大红大紫的开发工具. </p>

 title : The ooofbtools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>English: The cross platform OpenOffice.org extension OOo FBTools used to convert to and processing eBooks in FictionBook2 format. </p>

<p>Russian: Кроссплатформенный инструментарий OOo FBTools предназначен для конвертации документов из форматов, поддерживаемых OpenOffice.org Writer в формат FictionBook2. </p>

<p>Таким образом входные форматы документов для FBTools следующие: .doc, .dot, .rtf, .txt, .html, .htm, .oth, .odt, .ott, .stw, .sdw, .xml, .vor, .psw, .wps, .wpd, .fodt, .sxw, Microsoft Word 2003XML .xml, и другие, с которыми работает OpenOffice.org Writer. </p>

<p>Инструментарий работает на тех платформах, где работает OpenOffice.org Writer, т.е. MS Windows 98/2000/XP/Vista, MacOS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD и другие. </p>

<p>OOo FBTools не использует DOM технологию – задействован свой парсинг документов и печать в текстовый файл информации, собранной после анализа. </p>

<p>Если документ отформатирован стилями правильно, то после его конвертации практически не требуется дальнейшая правка (за редким исключением) в редакторах fb2 формата! После проведения десятков тестов с документами различной структурой, полученные fb2 книги у меня всегда проходили валидацию.</p>

<p>En julio de 2008 hemos puesto por primera vez el código en un repositorio público. Tomamos como punto de partida la versión 2006.11.13, le fuimos agregando algunas modificaciones que se le habían realizado luego de esa fecha, y luego comenzamos una importante reorganización de la estructura de carpetas y archivos. Como consecuencia de estos cambios, la versión en SVN aún resulta inestable, pero está convergiendo a un estado satisfactorio. Llegado ese punto, publicaremos las instrucciones detalladas para la instalación. </p>

 summary : <p>This project provides a 3GPP-compliant Charging Gateway Function (CGF) as a sink for SGSN/GGSN/etc streamed CDRs on the 3GPP Ga/Gz interface. Refer 3GPP 32.295. These are common data elements of GSM/UMTS mobile telephone networks. This is part of the toolkit developed by 3G Telco Tools. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The CDRs are streamed over the GTP&#39; (GTP-prime) protocol, a subset of the main GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) protocol used between the SGSN and GGSN. </p>

<p>open-cgf implements all the features of 32.295 although not all SGSN/GGSNs implement, and therefore exercise, these features. It is not yet clear if any CDFs (GGSNs/SGSNs/etc) implement the special sequence number/duplicate-avoidance features described in this standard. </p>

 title : The openbotlist Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewUpdated as of 8/2/2009: Botlist is an example application, a proof of concept demo to demonstrate how to use a JVM Language (JRuby) in a J2EE environment.  It could possibly work as a complete solution, but it is mostly an example implementation of a web application.  The source is fully available and I encourage J2EE web application developers to browse the source. </p>

<p>Google recently released news that Google&#39;s index contains one trillion URLs. This is great news that the Internet has grown to such enormous size but not that great for users that want to traverse all of that information. Google and other search engines provide applications for users to &quot;search&quot; the web and get to information they are interested based on keywords and other queries. Social networking sites turns that paradigm around a bit. Applications like Del.icio.us, Digg, Reddit and Botlist provide user portal sites for users to post their favorite links. As opposed to users querying and searching for interesting links. Users submit their links to sites like Reddit and tag them with interesting titles and keywords. Hopefully the user submitted links fall inline with content that you are also interested in. Botlist attempted to go a step further and focus on the bot/agent generated links. News aggregation and user submitted links. </p>

<p>Botlist contains an open source suite of software applications for social bookmarking and collecting online news content for use on the web.  Multiple web front-ends exist based on Django (through Google AppEngine), Rails, and J2EE.  Users and remote agents are allowed to submit interesting articles.  There are additional remote agent libraries for back-end text mining operations.  The system is broken up by the back-end specification and front-end specification. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Front-EndThe botlist web front-end displays new and interesting URLs submitted from remote agents or through user submissions.  There is also an ads listing section so that users can post personal/ad profiles.  The application itself is created with the following libraries; Liftweb and SpringMVC for the visible parts of the website, JRuby and J2EE&#39;s Spring framework for business logic and the middleware piece, Hibernate for object relational mapping (ORM). It is designed to run with Tomcat but should work with other J2EE servers. Search functionality uses the Lucene API. </p>

<p>(An additional front-end is being developed on the Hunchentoot lisp web server) </p>

<p>Other FeaturesNews aggregation (some links will be included); over half a million links thus far. </p>

<p>You can reply to comments, up or down vote the news articles, post new article links similar to other social bookmarking sites. </p>

<p>Comma delimited output for easy, text based access (for developers) Numerous documentation on architecture Discussion Forums section    User profiles    Ad/Profile listing section, listed by city   Sort search by relevancy, submit date Can also operate as a simple bug tracking system   </p>

 summary : <p>OpenCaptureOpenCapture is a java open-source document capture system.  Our goal is to provide a capture system that can cross platforms.  In the current market all major document capture systems are designed to run on the windows platform.  We hope to provide a good alternative. </p>

<p>Update 10/14/2008All, we apologize for not getting this information to you sooner.  We&#39;ve decided to not release 0.0.2 as planned.  The reason being we don&#39;t have any major updates to the code other than small bug fixes.  Also, as we&#39;ve not seen any comments or questions we believe those of you using OC are not running into any serious issues.  Release 0.0.2 will be released later this month once we&#39;ve completed buidling/testing the administration module.  If you are interested in seeing what&#39;s currently available in 0.0.2, please check CVS or drop an email and we&#39;d be happy to provide a build.  Thanks for your support and please continue to check back. </p>

<p>Update 9/25/2008OpenCapture 0.0.2 is planned for release on October 13, 2008.  This next release will contain fixes for a few bugs found as well as a new delivery plugin for Alfresco.  Please continue to check back for updated documentation and releases.   </p>

<p>OpenCapture 0.0.1 Released 9/1/2008Finally, the initial release of OC is available.  There&#39;s a long road ahead of us filled with updates and fixes so please let us know what you think.  I&#39;d also like to send out a special thanks to the folks working on the ZXing project.  Without their efforts, OC would not be possible. </p>

<p>Update 08/17/2008Beta 0.0.1 is planned for release on September 1, 2008.  The wiki is updated almost daily with new or updated information.  If you&#39;d like to get a head start, checkout the GettingStarted document along with the other configuration documentation. </p>

<p>OpenCapture 0.0.1 BetaOur first beta is just about ready.  There&#39;s a lot of configuration that has to be done in order to use the system.  We hope that this will not deter anyone from attempting to use OpenCapture.  Please continue to check back for updated information.  Also regularly check the wiki as we&#39;ll be documenting on a more frequent basis from this point forward.</p>

 summary : <p>OpenCvSharp </p>

<p>DescriptionOpenCvSharpは、OpenCVをC#やVB.NETなどの.NET Frameworkの言語から利用するためのラッパーです。大部分はC#によって書かれています。OpenCvSharpを使うと、C#やVB.NETといった言語から、簡単に、かつ高速な画像処理プログラムを作成できます。 </p>

<p>OpenCvSharp is a wrapper of OpenCV for .NET Framework written in C# and C++/CLI. You can use many popular image processing and computer vision algorithms from C#, VB.NET, etc. </p>

<p>Please correct, when I use wrong English!! </p>

<p>Featuresおそらく、OpenCvSharpはSharperCVやOpenCVDotNetといった他のOpenCVのラッパーよりも多くの関数を実装しています。 多くのクラスがIDisposableインターフェイスを実装しているので、usingを使ってスタイリッシュなコードを記述できます。 オブジェクト指向な書き方を強制しません。OpenCVのネイティブの関数をそのまま呼べます。  GDI+やWPFとの相互利用が可能です。OpenCVのIplImageとGDI+のBitmapやWPFのWriteableBitmapとの相互変換機能があります。   Probably OpenCvSharp wraps more OpenCV&#39;s functions than SharperCV and OpenCVDotNet.

 summary : <p>The main idea of opendbg is debugging all applications, both user and kernel mode. Of course, this tool is cross-platform. For now, it&#39;s impossible to use it atop Linux. The debugger kernel is a windows driver. UI is wxWidgets-based.</p>
 summary : <p>The goal of the project is to offer a library that will handle the communication with an Electronic Signature Device. It will also handle all necessary housekeeping of requirements by Law. </p>

<p>The first devices to be added are all devices that use the Micrelec protocol. First the network version and later the serial. </p>

<p>More devices might added later if we could find protocol specifications.  </p>

 title : The openface Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>There are over 33,000 Facebook applications (as of 7/08). In order to develop a Facebook application, a developer must be proficient in several languages including PHP (or Java) and JavaScript. In addition, the developer has to learn new technologies including FBML, FQL, Mock AJAX. There is an opportunity to significantly reduce the amount of effort involved in the initial learning and development as well as on-going maintenance of these applications. </p>

<p>In addition, OpenSocial is a strong alternative to the Facebook API but requires a completely different applicatin architecture. Developers find it time consuming to support both APIs in one application. This is analogous to the multi-platform support challenges of UNIX. There is no solution today to help ease this pain and we feel there is a significant opportunity to solve this problem. </p>

<p>The Openface Project is a PHP framework used for building applications that run on Facebook and OpenSocial platforms. Openface is a set of libraries that you add into your PHP application that enables the same codebase to run within Facebook, Bebo and OpenSocial containers like MySpace, Hi5 &amp; Orkut. </p>

 summary : <p>are you seeking for fun mobile games? You have not found it yet?! So, let&#39;s start coding one! </p>

<p>You should know about the lack of game APIs for Python S60. </p>

<p>This project is our start point to develop games and libraries for game development in python for S60 devices.  </p>

<p>So, Why python?! Let&#39;s see how to use accelerometer in Python for S60: </p>

<p>import sensor </p>

<p># list available sensors </p>

<p>sensores = sensor.sensors()            # if acc available, connects to the service   if sensores&#39;AccSensor&#39;: </p>

<p>iAcc = sensor.Sensor(sensores[&quot;AccSensor&quot;][&quot;id&quot;], sensores[&quot;AccSensor&quot;][&quot;category&quot;]) 
<br/>iAcc.connect(sensor_handler) 
<br/># callback function </p>

 title : The opengauge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to the opengauge project.  An increasingly valuable collection of utilities for helping one monitor and fine tune their vehicles energy usage. </p>

<p>Two main branches of this project include MPGuino and the OBDuino.  Aptly based off of the name Arduino, which served as the base for their creation. </p>

<p>The MPGuino - Designed with accuracy and pre-OBD2 vehicles in mind, it reports all essential energy usage measurements for your car.  It can report instant and tank MPG, remaining miles till the tank is empty, and many other things in between (also in metric).  It is hooked up directly to the vehicle&#39;s speed sensor and an injector.  This project is reaching maturity and is now available in kit form. The OBDuino32K - designed to hook safely to your vehicles OBD2 port. A port available on cars manufactured after 1996.  Capable of reporting all things available on the MPGuino, with the advantage of reporting other relevant data from the vehicles array of sensors.  This would include Temperatures, Engine Load, Manifold Pressure and others.  Please choose your project of choice above. </p>

<p>If you are interested in the most up-to-date information, we suggest checking out the OpenGauge / MPGuino FE computer forum at EcoModder.com.  That is where most of the active development takes place, and where your questions can be asked and answered.</p>

 title : The openlapi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OpenLAPI is most commonly used to access Bluetooth GPS devices from mobile devices, whilst retaining a high level of source code compatibility with JSR-179. OpenLAPI also has a range of backends for emulating location in development environments, making it a popular tool for J2ME developers. </p>

<p>The emulator mode supports the following back-ends for determining location:- </p>

<p>Access of hardware GPS device over bluetooth (if available) Emulate a moving device from an NMEA log file (recorder application provided). Emulate a moving device from a predefined trail in a Google Earth file KML. Emulate a moving device by picking random entries from a persistent store And the software may be shipped as part of a MIDlet (Java application) to provide location awareness through the following back-ends:- </p>

<p>Access of bluetooth GPS device. Bluetooth GPS devices are very affordable. Proprietary APIs. A select number of handsets were released with GPS devices in the period before the adoption of JSR-179, and therefore have their own interface. OpenLAPI can provide a wrapper layer to hide the hardware in these cases. Log file lookup, appropriate for physically static devices It is possible to negotiate commercial arrangements with local network providers to allow location detection via CellID and other network specific techniques (e.g. angle of incidence and triangulation). A mobile phone knows which basestation it is communicating with. By knowing where the basestation is located, location awareness can be accurate to several hundred meters! </p>

<p>Similar projectsThe FLOPI (Free LOcation aPI) project is written in J2SE and is aimed at adding location awareness to desktop Java applications through many of the same back-ends as OpenLAPI. However, be warned that the author has admitted serious numerical flaws in the Coordinates.distanceTo() and Coordinates.azimuthTo() methods. OpenLAPI uses the Vincenty (1.2MB) algorithm which is guaranteed to be accurate to the μm scale. </p>

<p>LegalFor various technical and legal reasons, OpenLAPI is not referred to as an implementation of JSR-179. In order to legally refer to a piece of software as a JSR, it must pass the SUN TCK. However, as there is currently no publicly available TCK for JSR-179, it is impossible to test any implementations for 100% compliance. Included in OpenLAPI is a suite of tests for self-compliance and we invite the Open Source community to contribute to the tests. </p>

<p>HistoryOpenLAPI was developed as a side project by Samuel Halliday of ThinkTank Maths Limited in December 2006 and originally released as open source software under the GPL licence. In April 2008, the license was changed to the LGPL. The license allows both commercial entities and open source developers to make use of location services on mobile devices. However, the licence demands that any changes that are made to the OpenLAPI source code are also released under the LGPL. You do not need to open source your applications themselves to use OpenLAPI.</p>

 summary : <p>DescriptionThe OpenVPN Auth-LDAP Plugin implements username/password authentication via LDAP for OpenVPN 2.x. </p>

<p>FeaturesUser authentication against LDAP. Simple Apache-style configuration file. LDAP group-based access restrictions. Integration with the OpenBSD packet filter, supporting adding and removing VPN clients from PF tables based on group membership. Tested against OpenLDAP, the plugin will authenticate against any LDAP server that supports LDAP simple binds -- including Active Directory. BuildingRequirementsOpenLDAP Headers and Library GNU Objective-C Compiler OpenVPN Plugin Header (included with the OpenVPN sources) re2c (used for the configuration file lexer) To build, you will need to configure the sources appropriately. Example: </p>

<p>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-openldap=/usr/local --with-openvpn=/usr/ports/security/openvpn/work/openvpn-2.0.2The module will be build in src/openvpn-auth-ldap.so and installed as ${prefix}/lib/openvpn-auth-ldap.so. </p>

<p>UsageAdd the following to your OpenVPN configuration file (adjusting the plugin path as required): </p>

<p>plugin /usr/local/lib/openvpn-auth-ldap.so &quot;&quot;The config directive must point to an auth-ldap configuration file. An example configuration file is provided with the distribution, or see the Configuration page. </p>

<p>SecurityPlease report all security issues directly to landonf+security (at) bikemonkey (dot) org. </p>

<p>Through the use of extensive unit testing, valgrind, and regression testing, we are very confident in the overall code quality of the plugin. There has been one security vulnerability to date, due to misinterpretation of LDAP RFCs. </p>

<p>2006-12-02: OpenVPN Auth-LDAP would accept empty passwords when validating against Novell Directory Server. This is known to not affect default installs of OpenLDAP (our test platform). Strict implementation of the LDAP RFCs requires that a directory server treat a bind with a valid DN and an empty password as an &quot;anonymous&quot; bind. If anonymous binds are enabled, this could lead to password bypass.</p>

 summary : <p>Orangutan Blogging EngineThis is a blogging system written in Ruby on Rails and assumes a technically savvy Rails user. Sorry, this isn&#39;t a replacement for Wordpress. I figure if you want to do a blogging system in Rails it&#39;s because you&#39;re using the framework already. So much of the configuration of this assumes you&#39;re handy with rake and YML files and the like. </p>

<p>The blogging system is intended to rely on mashing up a bunch of content from various sites instead of doing a lot of things by itself. Not only is this due to my own personal laziness but also it&#39;s due to my desire to use the best of breed of the various applications. </p>

<p>Features supported in this first beta release (which I&#39;m numbering 080325): </p>

<p>Standard blogging features (comments, posts, etc) RSS (Atom) feeds for posts Flickr support Twitter support Disqus support Google Analytics support Tagging for posts and searches and indexes by date and tags Views are done using HAML for easy modification Internal comment system with email notification of new posts, Gravatar support and more Flexible architecture allowing for new custom functionality to be easily added Administration user interface I wrote this for personal use because I didn&#39;t like the way Typo and Mephisto worked internally and wanted something of my own to hack around with.

 summary : <p>This is a Two-part Application.
<br/>The first is the Seller(restaurant owner) Side:
<br/>He has a user name and password along with his very own database.
<br/>He logs in and can view his menu items.
<br/>He can obviously add items, remove items, price items, order them how he wants, so on.
<br/>The food items can contain images and descriptions.
<br/>Complete customization.
<br/>He can add a layout for his &quot;page&quot; in the application.
<br/>There is a built in inbox that automatically grabs latest orders that have been placed.</p>

<p>The User Side:
<br/>A person can login to the app. He gets his very own database, also.
<br/>He can choose from a list of restaurants from surrounding areas.
<br/>Once chosen, the store layout that the restaurant manager has selected will be pulled up.
<br/>The menu items will be brought up, along with prices, descriptions, and images.
<br/>He can select what food he wants to eat. Drinks can be checked also, along with add-ons.
<br/>Finally there will be a checkout where the user can pay with a credit card. Once finalized, a message will be sent to the manager announcing that there is a new order he needs to get. The order will describe the final price, the entire order, the date/time it was placed, the users phone number and address.</p>

<p>For the moment the models beings created for this SVN are coming from Votekick (Zac) as well as Cebt (Casper), we would like to think we are both capable modelers, and simply want to make the Stargate mod and any other maps which are being created as close to the real thing as possible. </p>

<p>So far, this SVN contains models for an Ori ship(not the ship itself) and Stargate_RP_V4, both of which are maps and have no massive ship models.</p>

<p>Why does building Java code have to be so hard? Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if you could write in Java to build it? And why can&#39;t it be simpler to debug build scripts and files? </p>

<p>Well, now you can. Enter orogeny! It&#39;s free, open source and has the collective wisdom of tens of man years of software development behind it. </p>

<p>Orogeny is just a build tool. Like all the best software, it&#39;s very singularly focused. It does things one way, with the principal of least surprise. It&#39;s designed to compile java into an useful output - executable, modern jars ready to just execute and go. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t care about your source control system, it doesn&#39;t force you to use dependency libraries like maven and it does make the simplest tool around. You can extend it - you write Java. You can have IntelliJ intellisense it!</p>

 title : The osid-flickr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project is a Repository OSID Provider implementation for the photo sharing site, Flickr.  The Flickr OSID can be used to perform Keyword searches against flickr and return the results as OSID Assets.  This can be used by any application which acts as an OSID consumer.  More information on OSIDs is listed below.  This OSID was originally developed by the VUE project team. </p>

<p>The Repository Open Service Interface Definition (OSID) is an O.K.I. specification which defines the storing and retrieving of digital content, referred to as Assets. OSIDs are programmatic interfaces which comprise a Service Oriented Architecture for designing and building reusable and interoperable software. Multiple repositories can be managed or searched through the use of OSID adapter patterns where underneath a single Repository OSID can exist multiple Repository OSIDs forming a federation of repositories, where each implementation may be using a distinct incompatible technology and the OSID integrates them.

 summary : <p>EDLT 基于开源软件的内部项目，使用Google Hosting作为开发环境。, </p>
 summary : <p>oSpy is a tool which aids in reverse-engineering software running on the Windows platform. With the amount of proprietary systems that exist today (synchronization protocols, instant messaging, etc.), the amount of work required to keep up when developing interoperable solutions will quickly become a big burden when limited to traditional techniques. However, when the sniffing is done on the API level it allows a much more fine-grained view of what&#39;s going on. Seeing return-addresses for each recv/send call (for example), can prove useful when you want to look at the processing code at that spot in a debugger or static analysis tool. And if an application uses encrypted communication it&#39;s easy to intercept these calls as well. oSpy already intercepts one such API, and is the API used by MS</p>

 title : The outsider Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Table top gaming typically features turn-based combat systems that oftentimes include strict rules regarding movement and positioning of characters.  Paper maps and white board drawings have historically worked well for this purpose, and have been used for years.    </p>

<p>In a distributed game, physical paper and whiteboard markers are notably difficult to perceive from miles away. The goal of this project is to help alleviate this challenge by providing a method to replicate the ease and speed of drawing on a piece of paper in an environment that can be perceived at such distances. In lieu of major advances in virtual reality or telepathy, and at a much cheaper cost than expensive telepresence solutions used in surgeries, a networked client/server tool can provide such  an environment. </p>

<p>The plan is to provide the following features: </p>

<p>Live mapping with an accessible and fast toolset so that a game referee can create a scene on the spot.  Enjoyable, flexible graphical representations of environments and characters, featuring at least one additional dimension of representation over the two dimensional world of paper maps. Informative data tracking for characters, viewable in varying levels of detail using tooltips and inspectors, and allowing dynamic changes to reflect events in the game world. Permissions structures and rules that provide one or more individuals with special power to approve or mandate actions, and impose or override rules that govern the characters within the game. Flexible underlying systems enabling the representation of different game systems based on configurable settings and rules. Device connectivity to enable multiple distributed devices to view the same scene, receive timely updates, and provide their own input to the world. voice communication facilities to enable remote users to join in real time conversations with the other players. tools and enhancements to make the use of the tool seamless and unobtrusive.</p>

 summary : <p>BETA-0.01 Abstract </p>

<p>Run VideoLAN in a P2P fashion. The primary goal of this idea is to encourage two or more VideoLAN users on overlay networks to contribute in &#39;Synergy&#39; network, an integration of RON, Resilient Overlay Network. By applying incentive mechanisms, co-existing overlay networks would gain benefit and fairness if they choose to cooperate.(Better video quality!) The measure of success is evaluated by an utility function, which captures the ideas of bandwidth and congestion.  </p>

<p>The vision of this project is to enable each VLC peer having a quality stream of 300Kbps or more. We would like to make P2P VideoLAN resilient by experimenting the system in a small scale around 50 nodes. Therefore the P2P VideoLAN can provide good video quality and detect network failures quickly. Other students should be genuinely interested in this idea for the future work. Like other successful P2P file sharing applications, P2P VideoLAN has great potential to reach a critical mass of users. </p>

<p>Taxation and Bit-for-Bit are incentive mechanisms for p2p network. It is possible to apply similar mechanisms to inter-overlay networks as well. In this project, we will extend incentive methods to Synergy, an inter-overlay architecture constructed by RON, Resilient Overlay Network. 
<br/>   For example, the primary agent in Synergy will try to maximize the sum of overall utilities. The primary agent can achieve this by controlling traffic in Synergy or limiting flow in each overlay. Overlays now are more willing to contribute, since contribution in this incentive game will increase its utility in general. 
<br/>  Therefore, the core problem of this project is to explore possible good incentives mechanisms that would encourage overlays to contribute. We would also like to come up a better design and implementation which would improve Synergy. The experiment will be run on PlanetLab, and utility gains among different incentive methods will be the measure of success. 
<br/>  1 Background Overlay networks provides an infrastructure which is flexible and easily deployable. Synergy, an overlay inter-networking architecture, further leverages the use of each individual overlay. Better routes and richer resources might present in Synergy network that a single overlay might not have. 
<br/>  2 Overview Architecture 
<br/>  2.1 RON 
<br/>Resilient Overlay Network (RON) is to provide a routing overlay that can quickly detect and recover from failures. To achieve this goal, each node in RON network will constantly probe every other nodes to exchange routing information, such as packet loss rate and latency(RTT). Each node then computes bandwidth on each link and stores the information in its performance database. Since each node now has global knowledge of a complete graph in RON, they can arbitrarily pick their desired route and quickly route around various Internet failures. 
<br/>  2.2 Synergy 
<br/>The goal of Synergy is to cooperate co-existing overlays. Each individual overlay under Synergy is a module of RON. A Synergy network is formed by a collection of exported nodes from each overlay under Synergy. Since Synergy is a larger set of RON network, it has potential to provide richer resources and better routes that a single overlay might not have. 
<br/>    3 Methods 
<br/>We would like to see which of the following methods yields the highest overall utilities in Synergy network. The utilities function is defined as follow: 
<br/>  ui(ri, fi, Fi) = bi(ri) – ci(fi, Fi) 
<br/>Fi: forward capacity 
<br/>Ri: receive capacity 
<br/>fi, ri: actual forward bandwidth and actual receive bandwidth 
<br/>bi: capture the idea of benefit 
<br/>ci: capture the idea of cost with fi, Fi, and congestion 
<br/>  With the utilities function, we can evaluate the following three incentive methods and analyze the results. 
<br/>  3.1 Bit-for-Bit Method 
<br/>There is no free lunch. Under Bit-for-Bit scheme, how much a peer can download is equal to how much a peer are willing to upload. The utility gain is propositional to the upload rate. This method is simple and fair. It is expected to perform well under the situation that every host in the overlay networks has high bandwidth. 
<br/>  3.2 BitTorrent Methods 
<br/>BitTorrent, like Gnutella and Napster, are popular file sharing software. Its built-in incentive mechanism is a process of peer selection. A peer would upload to other peers which contribute the most packets to it. Meanwhile the peer might drop one of the currently connected peers if there is another peer that contributes more. For example, peer P is uploading and downloading from four peers. Every 30 seconds, peer P will upload to a new peer in the network and download from that new peer as well. If the new peer contributes more packets to P than any of the original four peers that P connects, P will drop the peer which contributes the least and pick the new peer to exchange file. 
<br/>  3.3 Taxation Methods 
<br/>The goal of Taxation scheme is to yield the highest &#39;overall&#39; utility. Each peer in overlay will determine its upload rate and download rate based on a fixed tax schedule. Peers can also strategically change their upload rate to maximize its utility function. The equation for a tax schedule can be linear or exponential. A linear tax schedule looks like this 
<br/>f = max(t . (r-G),0) 
<br/>f: forward rate(upload rate) 
<br/>t: tax, which is constant 
<br/>r: receive rate(download rate) 
<br/>G: grant, or surplus bandwidth 
<br/>  As long as the tax rate t is greater than one, there is a chance that f &gt; r, and the difference between f and r will go into G. Therefore the primary agent in Synergy can redistribute the extra bandwidth by increasing G in the tax schedule. It results in re-distribution of bandwidth among peers. Notice that this tax schedule is not to maximize each peer&#39;s utility function, but to maximize the overall utilities in Synergy network. This scheme seems to be the best incentive method because it supports the notion of “try your best to contribute, and it is very likely you get higher download bandwidth.” On the other hand, under Bit-to-Bit and BitTorrent&#39;s incentive methods, peers&#39; utility gain is strictly limited to their actual upload capacity.

<p> </p>

<p>PacBuilder is a simple utility which gives the users the ability to compile/recompile archlinux packages, fetching their PKGBUILDs from both ABS and AUR. This software could be considered similar to gentoo&#39;s &quot;emerge&quot;. </p>

<p>It is written from scratch with a simple but organized code, and supports translations (using gettext) too! </p>

<p>It differs from other tools like yaourt because it has few features like recompiling the whole system and/or build the dependencies of a package (while yaourt simply installs the binary). </p>

<p>Everything is provided with a nice text-based interface.</p>

 title : The pacparser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pacparser is a library to parse proxy auto-config (PAC) files. Proxy auto-config files are a vastly used proxy configuration method these days. Web browsers can use a PAC file to determine  which proxy server to use or whether to go direct for a given URL. PAC files are written in JavaScript and can be programmed to return different proxy methods (e.g. &quot;PROXY proxy1:port; DIRECT&quot;) depending upon URL, source IP address, protocol, time of the day etc. PAC files introduce a lot of possibilities. Look at the wikipedia link above to find out more about them. </p>

<p>Needless to say, PAC files are now a widely accepted method for proxy configuration management and companies all over are using them in corporate environment. Almost all popular web browsers support PAC files. The idea behind pacparser is to make it easy to add this PAC file parsing capability to any program (C and python supported right now). It comes as a shared C library and a python module which can be used to make any C or python program PAC scripts intelligent. Some very useful targets could be popular web software like wget, curl and python-urllib. </p>

<p>Please look at the README and other links for more information. </p>

<p>Usage ExamplesUsing it with python: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pacparser
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pacparser.init()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pacparser.parse_pac(&#39;examples/wpad.dat&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pacparser.find_proxy(&#39;http://www.google.com&#39;, &#39;www.google.com&#39;)
<br/>&#39;PROXY proxy1.manugarg.com:3128; PROXY proxy2.manugarg.com:3128; DIRECT&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pacparser.find_proxy(&#39;http://www2.manugarg.com&#39;, &#39;www2.manugarg.com&#39;)
<br/>&#39;DIRECT&#39;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pacparser.cleanup()
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Using it in C: </p>

<p>manugarg@hobbiton:~$ cat pactest.c
<br/>#include </p>

<p>int pacparser_init();
<br/>int pacparser_parse_pac(char* pacfile);
<br/>char *pacparser_find_proxy(char *url, char *host);
<br/>void pacparser_cleanup();</p>

 title : The pacs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pactester is a tool to test Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC) files. PAC files are used by browsers to determine the &#39;right&#39; proxy for a URL. Since the PAC file evaluation mechanism is generated inside the browser and cannot be accessed from outside, the only way to tell which proxy your browser will use for a specific URL is manual inspection of the  PAC file. But manual inspection doesn&#39;t really scale very well. Pactester resolves this problem. It makes use of JavaScript interpreter and Netscape/Mozilla APIs to evaluate the PAC files and automates the whole process. </p>

<p>Pactester reads a PAC file, evaluates it in a JavaScript context and uses this PAC file&#39;s logic to determine the proxy for a specific URL. </p>

<p>Usage:  ./pactester   [-h host] [-c client_ip]
<br/>        ./pactester   [-c client_ip]</p>

<p>Options:
<br/>  -p pacfile: PAC file to test
<br/>  -u url: URL to test
<br/>  -h host: Host part of the URL
<br/>  -c client_ip: client IP address (defaults to IP address of the machine on which script is running)
<br/>  -f urlslist: a file containing list of URLs to be tested.</p>

<p>Example:
<br/>  ./pactester -p wpad.dat -u http://www.google.com
<br/>  ./pactester -p wpad.dat -u http://www.google.com -c 192.168.1.105

 summary : <p>Demonstrate Display Tag External Paging and Sorting via paging queries to an RDBMS.  Implemented using Hibernate Criteria generated from calls in the web interface by Display Tag.  This is an Appfuse java project.  Solution uses Display Tags Paginated List extension. </p>

<p>OverviewDisplay Tag allows paging and sorting, if you click on a column header to sort ascending or descending. Note that it only sorts the records that are on the page - all the other records are excluded from this &#39;internal&#39; Display Tag sort. Similarly when the page was generated every single record was retrieved, but only 25 were shown. With big datasets this is going to slow your web app down, (a lot), and the inconsistent sorting will confuse your users. This is what we are going to fix using Appfuse, Hibernate and Display Tag. </p>

 title : The paperworld3d Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>For the Flash on Tap attendees who are checking out the code after my session....when you check out the source make sure you check out the &#39;branches&#39; directory - in there is a branch called &#39;reorganisation&#39; - that&#39;s the source you want - it hasn&#39;t been merged with the trunk yet and it&#39;s a bit of a mess still.... if you drop me an email at trevor at infrared5 dot com i&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s ready for use.The aim of the Paperworld project is to provide developers and designers with the tools to create realtime Multiplayer Games using Flash, Unity3D or the iPhone.... or all 3! </p>

<p>Current release target is 0.7 and is due June &#39;09Paperworld can be used as a complete framework with which to build large games and applications or you can just use the individual libraries you need for your specific purpose without the overhead and learning curve of becoming familiar with yet another framework.  </p>

<p>The Paperworld server runs as a service in any existing Red5 installation. By default Paperworld uses jMonkey as the 3D engine for running its simulations, but if you prefer you can create your own adaptor for any java-based 3D engine. If you need an adaptor for a particular 3D engine please get in touch, i&#39;d be happy to help put one together for you. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>A complete message-based connection API for Flash allows for easy customisation of handshake procedures and creating custom functionality just by creating a new type of message. Connect to Red5 from Unity3D or iPhone via UDP. Support more fast-twitch models than Flash can handle using datagrams instead of all that AMF overhead. Game AI - Steering Behaviours, Decision Making etc. etc. allow you to create complex behaviours for NPCs. Multiple controller support. More than just mouse and keys - use the wiimote, a custom joystick - even your iPhone! Connect it all together. Provide specific clients for each platform for the same game. Use each platform for its strengths.</p>

 title : The pdfetch Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pdfetch is a small web app that automagically fetches the PDF reprint of a PubMed article given its PMID.  If pdfetch cannot find a local copy of the reprint, then it downloads the reprint from the publisher&#39;s website to the local repository (of course only if the reprint is free or if you have authorized access to it, e.g., via your university library). </p>

<p>pdfetch can also be used for the creation of a shared local repository of PDF reprints  designed for small trusted groups, e.g. science labs, by having every member of the group point to the same local server running pdfetch. </p>

<p>If you use the &quot;ferret&quot; branch version of pdfetch, PDF reprints in the local repository can be easily searched using any web browser. </p>

<p>pdfetch is best used from PubMed using a bookmarklet (for any modern web browser) or a greasemonkey script (for Firefox only). Both assume that the pdfetch server is listening on localhost:3301 and that Javascript is enabled in your web browser. </p>

<p>To install the bookmarklet just drag the link in the list to your right onto your Links/Bookmarks toolbar/menu. To use the bookmarklet, just click it when using PubMed (of course the pdfetch server needs to be running too!). </p>

<p>To install the greasemonkey script just make sure you are using Firefox + Greasemonkey and click on this link. It adds a &#39;Fetch&#39; link to the article display page in PubMed for easy access to pdfetch. </p>

<p>pdfetch requires Camping and Mechanize. </p>

<p>To install pdfetch follow these easy steps: </p>

<p>install Ruby +  RubyGems install camping, mechanize, and mongrel by executing the following command gem install camping mechanize mongrel --include-dependencies save pdfetch.rb in the directory where you want the PDF reprints to reside. launch the pdfetch server by executing the following command camping pdfetch.rb or (for better security) camping -h 127.0.0.1 pdfetch.rb. You can change the port that the pdfetch server listens to (default is 3301) by executing the following command camping -p  pdfetch.rb. If you have any problem, add -s mongrel to any of the above commands. you are ready to go!!! You can fetch the PDF reprint of a PubMed article with PMID &#39;123456&#39; by going to http://localhost:3301/fetch/123456 in your web browser, or by using the bookmarklet/greasemonkey script directly from PubMed.</p>

 summary : <p>The Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library (PEGTL) is a C++0x library for creating parsers according to a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG). Grammars are embedded as regular C++ code, created with template programming (not template meta programming). These hierarchies naturally correspond to the inductive definition of PEGs. The library extends on the subject of PEGs with new expression types, actions that can be attached to grammar rules, and mechanisms to ensure helpful diagnostics in case of parsing errors. PEGs are superficially similar to Context-Free Grammars (CFGs); for a description see Wikipedia page on PEGs or this paper on PEGs by Bryan Ford.</p>

 title : The pencil-code Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Pencil Code is primarily designed to deal with weakly compressible turbulent flows, which is why we use high-order first and second derivatives. To achieve good parallelization, we use explicit (as opposed to compact) finite differences. Typical scientific targets include driven MHD turbulence in a periodic box, convection in a slab with non-periodic upper and lower boundaries, a convective star embedded in a fully nonperiodic box, accretion disc turbulence in the shearing sheet approximation, self-gravity, non-local radiation transfer, dust particle evolution with feedback on the gas, etc. A range of artificial viscosity and diffusion schemes can be invoked to deal with supersonic flows. For direct simulations regular viscosity and diffusion is being used. </p>

<p>The code is written in well-commented Fortran90. </p>

<p>For a more detailed description and a full introduction see the manual.pdf file (see under links on the right). </p>

 title : The perfsonar-ps Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>perfSONAR-PS is a set of independent software services that implement the perfSONAR protocols for network performance monitoring.  As with other implementations of the perfSONAR standard, all services offer protocol compatibility.  The key feature of this software is the ability to federate between deployments, particularly those that span multiple domains, making the job of solving end-to-end performance problems on paths crossing several networks much easier to address. </p>

<p>The perfSONAR-PS services provide Web Services (WS) based interfaces into already deployed network monitoring infrastructures and act as an intermediate layer, between the performance measurement tools and the diagnostic or visualization applications. The targeted audience for these services is network Network Operation Centers (NOCs) at Universities and Regional networks, however these services are broadly useful to the general public at large. </p>

<p>The perfSONAR-PS software suite is developed entirely in the Perl programming language, taking full advantage of numerous language features and benefits including the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) distribution system. This software manager makes perfSONAR-PS the ideal choice for integration into typical NOC environments. </p>

 title : The perl-appengine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GoalsThe goal of the Perl-AppEngine project is </p>

<p>to get Perl implemented on Google App Engine </p>

<p>Get InvolvedAnyone who is interested in following the discussion should sign up on the mailing lists. Please sign up on the Perl-AppEngine mailing list Please also sign up on the more general Cloud Perl mailing list, regarding anything having to do with Cloud Computing in Perl. Start discussing your ideas of how to move this project forward. Ideas can be floated on the mailing list. However, to make meaningful progress on an idea, it should be documented on the wiki. Discussion on the mailing list will be centered around updating those documented ideas. When ideas mature, they should definitely be documented on the wiki on this project site. Getting Started with the CodeGettingStarted - describes how to check out the code and get started Project Status2009-07-01 - The project is live again. We are in a code sprint in July to get it functional.

Arguments encoded in protocol buffers can be passed through an API to invoke services provided by Google. perl-appengine - The dev kit for Perl applications which will run in the Google compute farm. BackgroundPerl is not currently supported by Google App Engine (only Python). Google wants to (eventually) support other languages on App Engine. &quot;Although Python is currently the only language supported by Google App Engine, we look forward to supporting more languages in the future.&quot; Google knows that there is a significant community that would like Perl to be supported on App Engine (including a variety of Google employees, some of which I know). If you would like to communicate your support for Perl on App Engine to Google, go to the issues list and click the star next to &quot;Issue 34: Add Perl Support&quot;. (You must logged in to Google in order to see the star and select it.) NOTE: Do not post a general message to the list. Simply click on the star. There are a variety of PerlAppEngineDiscussions around the web. Support for Perl on App Engine will require modifications to the Perl language itself, a task which the Perl community would most likely need to get involved in. (see the Language discussion under General Questions) Support for Perl on App Engine will obviously never occur before the Google App Engine team gets involved. The Google App Engine team is currently very busy with things besides Perl support. A variety of overtures have been made to the App Engine team to organize the community support to do the work. (an example) Neither Google nor the Google App Engine Team initiated this project. This is a community-sponsored project to do all of the work necessary to make it easy for the Google App Engine team to embrace and support Perl.  Edit:  some Googlers have now joined but it&#39;s still not a Google-official project. Because there is no guarantee that Google will pick up on the assistance that we are offering, another project has been created called Cloud Perl. This other project is devoted to the use of Perl in all kinds of cloud computing environments. LinksApiProxy PerlAppEngine PerlAppEngineDiscussions PerlAppEngineDesign GettingStarted</p>

 title : The permissionable-attributes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Permissionable Attributes allows you to declare which attributes of a model have permissions associated with them and what those permissions are. </p>

<p>The best example of where you would use this plugin is for a community site where you have certain attributes on a user model that are only viewable to certain people.  For example, some attributes might be viewable to the entire public, while others might only  be available to that user&#39;s friends. The plugin only supports mutually exclusive permissions.  Meaning, an attribute is either just  viewable by the public or just viewable by friends but not both.  However, if an attribute is viewable by the public your helpers should probably be smart enough to that friends should also be able to view them.     See the README for more info: </p>

 summary : <p>Persephone is a data abstraction mechanism. Its purpose is to remove all the tedious parts of working with databases and lets you focus on real code. Standard searching, loading, and saving of data to/from databases is handled automatically -- along with protection for data types and incorrect operations. Beyond persistence Persephone can also generate HTML listings and Forms for your data. </p>

<p>	 Unlike ActiveRecord style systems, Persephone assumes you have a lot of existing code and/or and existing database and have no ability, nor desire, to completely replace it. Thus Persephone operates in a miminally invasive manner, by being very clear about what it is doing, and operating happily alongside alternate solutions. There are no method assumptions, no prescriptive behaviours, and basically nothing that will make curse the solution. 	 </p>

<p>Currently Persephone supports PHP code generation.  Other targets are possible, the source schema language is not PHP specific.</p>

 title : The persevere-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Persevere is an open source set of tools for persistence and distributed computing using an intuitive standards-based JSON interfaces of HTTP REST, JSON-RPC, JSONPath, and REST Channels. The core of the Persevere project is the Persevere Server. The Persevere server includes a Persevere JavaScript client, but the standards-based interface is intended to be used with any framework or client. </p>

<p>The Persevere Server is an object storage engine and application server (running on Java/Rhino) that provides persistent data storage of dynamic JSON data in an interactive server side JavaScript environment with the following key features: </p>

<p>Create, read, update, and delete access to persistent data through a standard JSON HTTP/REST web interface Dynamic object persistence - expando objects, arrays, and JavaScript functions can be stored, for extensive JavaScript persistence support Remote execution of JavaScript methods on the server through JSON-RPC for a consistent client/server language platform Flexible and fast indexed query capability through JSONQuery Comet-based data monitoring capabilities through REST Channels with Bayeux transport plugin/negotiation support Data-centric capability-based object level security with user management, Persevere is designed to be accessed securely through Ajax with public-facing sites Comprehensive referencing capabilities using JSON referencing, including circular, multiple, lazy, non-lazy, cross-data source, and cross-site referencing for a wide variety of object structures Data integrity and validation through JSON Schema Class-based data hierarchy - typed objects can have methods, inheritance, class-based querying Pluggable data source architectures - SQL tables, XML files, remote web services can be used as data stores Service discovery through Service Mapping Description Persevere JavaScript Client is a persistent object mapping framework for JavaScript in the browser, which allows programmers to access, traverse, and manipulate persisted objects  graphs easily with standard JavaScript syntax and intuitive Persistent JavaScript (PJS) API. Persevere implements the PJS API and maps JavaScript objects  to persistent storage objects remotely through JSON based RESTful web services following the JSPON (JavaScript Persistent Object Notation) data  interchange specification. Persevere accesses persisted  object graphs provided through  RESTful JSON data sources which can represent various underlying sources such as database tables,  XML files, web services, and object repositories, and such persisted graphs can even span domains.  Persevere allows application code to be persisted and exist within these object graphs, to facilitate  improved object oriented design and organization. Persevere can provide orthogonal persistence and lazy loading support with standard JavaScript property access and modification through JavaScript pre-processing, or it can provide these capabilities natively with JavaScript 1.7. Note that the Persevere JavaScript Client is released under the MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 license.</p>

 title : The phantom Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Phantom protocol is a system for decentralized anonymization of generic network traffic. It has been designed with the following main goals in mind: </p>

<p>1. Completely decentralized. </p>

<p>- No critical or weak points to attack or put (il)legal pressure on. </p>

<p>2. Maximum resistance against all kinds of DoS attacks. </p>

<p>- Direct technical destructive attacks will practically be the only possible way to even attempt to stop it. </p>

<p>3. Theoretically secure anonymization. </p>

<p>- Probabilistic methods (contrary to deterministic methods) must be used in a completely decentralized design like this, where no other peer can be trusted, so focus is put on optimizing these methods. </p>

<p>4. Theoretically secure end-to-end transport encryption. </p>

<p>- This is simple in itself, but still important in the context of anonymization. </p>

<p>5. Completely (virtually) isolated from the &quot;normal&quot; Internet. </p>

<p>- No one should have to worry about crimes being perpetrated from their own IP address. </p>

<p>6. Maximum protection against identification of protocol usage through traffic analysis. </p>

<p>- You never know what the next draconian law might be. </p>

<p>7. Capable of handling larger data volumes, with acceptable throughput. </p>

<p>- Most existing anonymization solutions are practically unusable for (or even prohibit) larger data volumes. </p>

<p>8. Generic and well-abstracted design, compatible with all new and existing network enabled software. </p>

<p>- Software application developer participation should not be needed, it should be easy to apply the anonymization to both new and already existing products like e.g. web browsers and file transfer software.</p>

 title : The php-csv-utils Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PHP CSV Utilities has a new home!For future updates, please refer to my new blog: http://lukevisinoni.com/ </p>

<p>Several of the recent projects I’ve been working on have required an “import from csv file” feature. PHP comes with a few functions for reading and writing csv files right out of the box: fgetcsv and fputcsv. While these are good functions and they get the job done I find they just aren’t enough in many cases. It would be nice if PHP had an interface like python’s csv module. Enter PHP Csv Utilities. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It has been months since there was any kind of update on this poor little library. I released the last version (0.2) prematurely, which resulted in a poor release, confusing file structure, and a lot of bugs. I&#39;d like to let anybody interested in the library know that I am working on version 0.3 right now as well as a much improved (and more transparent) build / release process. If there are any bugs or issues you have with the library please leave a comment or shoot me an email and I&#39;ll do my best to make sure it&#39;s addressed. </p>

<p>Please, if you have any feature requests, suggestions, questions, anything... drop me an email. </p>

 title : The php-develop Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A simple framework that does PHP right, inspired by the likes of Django and to a lesser extent Ruby on Rails, as well as CakePHP and Symfony. Mostly, it tries to mimic the better frameworks in the crappy language of PHP. </p>

<p>It was developed because of a need to have a PHP framework, not because the developer liked using PHP.</p>
 summary : <p>As stated in the summary, this simple library allows you to access your MySQL (you can modify it to use other databases) tables, and at the same time, protect yourself from SQL Injections. </p>

<p>Other features include type checking, and error exceptions that makes it simple to return errors to your forms (Like Django) </p>

 title : The php-email-address-validation Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThis email address validation function was originally released on AddedBytes.com in June 2004, and was updated following many comments and suggestions from readers. </p>

<p>In July 2008, ICANN announced that the TLD system would be opened up to allow the creation of many many more TLDs, making it more important than ever that email addresses are properly validated according to the standards that define them. </p>

<p>Thus, the script was moved to Google Code (blog post), to enable easier maintenance and hopefully more people to contribute code. It was originally released under a Creative Commons License, but that has been changed to a BSD license which, among others things, allows commercial use. </p>

<p>AimsThe aim of this project is to create an email address validation class (or function) that checks for technical validity1 in email addresses, the idea being then that a site can send an email to that address to verify ownership. </p>

<p>1) Certain parts of the standards could be considered security risks and are not in widespread use, so at the time of writing folding white space, control characters and comments are not considered valid by this script. </p>

<p>Join!The main reason this code has been released under an open source license is to allow others to improve it. Best place to start is probably the Google Group.</p>

 title : The php-fsapi Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library provides a PHP proxy client for the FamilySearch API which anyone may use to interface with the FamilySearch API. This proxy class will return the raw XML result from the FamilySearch API. </p>

<p>This code also provides a library for parsing and working with the data returned from the FamilySearch API.  The FamilySearch API returns data in an XML format. This library parses that XML into an object model which client code can work with to display and manipulate the data.  This library can also be used to convert the parsed data into a GEDCOM format. </p>

<p>This library may also be used to integrate the same client with a PhpGedView site. </p>

<p>This code was created by students from Neumont University. Neumont University is a revolutionary school which provides a hands-on, project-based environment for teaching computer science students.  In addition to classes in computer science theory, the students work on real projects such as this one which truly prepare them to enter the work force. </p>

<p>Access to the web service API requires agreements to be signed. Developers may obtain access to the &quot;ref&quot; system which provides a limited data set and exists solely for development purposes. Please see http://devnet.familysearch.org for more details. </p>

 title : The php-liquid Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Liquid is a PHP port of the Liquid template engine for Ruby, which was
<br/>written by Tobias Lutke. Although there are many other templating engines
<br/>for PHP, including Smarty (from which Liquid was partially inspired), Liquid
<br/>had some advantages that made porting worthwhile:</p>

<p>* Default syntax that is usable in any type of document, not just html,
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;without need for escaping.
<br/>* 100% secure, no possibility of embedding PHP code.
<br/>* Clean OO design, rather than the mix of OO and procedural found
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in other templating engines.
<br/>* Seperate compiling and rendering stages for impreoved performance.
<br/>* 100% Markup compatibility with a Ruby templating engine, making templates
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;usable for either.

 title : The php-text-statistics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThe PHP Text Statistics class will help you to indentify issues with your website content, especially with readability.  </p>

<p>It allows you to measure the readability of text using common scoring systems, including:  </p>

<p>Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Flesch Kincaid Grade Level Gunning Fog Score Coleman Liau Index SMOG Index Automated Reability Index </p>

<p>This code was originally released on AddedBytes.com (formerly ILoveJackDaniels.com) in July 2004.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s New?In July 2008, I rewrote the code into a more up-to-date format (it was a mess before ... no structure, no validation ... awful). There are versions for both PHP5 and PHP4. The code was turned into this open source project and released under a New BSD License in August 2008. </p>

<p>The code that generates the statistics is in a simple class structure. There are also several unit test classes to ensure that changes made don&#39;t break existing functionality. There is also a live version of this tool. </p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges with measuring text readability is the counting of syllables, which can be tricky to work out. There are rules in the statistics file for working out the syllable count of words, and a large list of words to test these rules against. </p>

<p>Please feel free to add to the test word list, especially if you can find words whose syllable count is not correctly calculated (even more especially if you can also add code to the class so your word is correctly handled!). </p>

<p>Homographs are going to be impossible to calculate as they depend on context (i.e., &quot;he moped around the house&quot;, &quot;she rode her moped to school), but there are few enough of these not to be a concern. </p>

 title : The phpaspect Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This web application allows every body without any particular knowledge required in webmastering to create his own website. </p>

<p>It requires a web server with a remote access. Then you install, configure and use it with your web browser. </p>

<p>It&#39;s composed by a kernel and modules which can use the little PHPBoost development framework. The structure is like a personal computer&#39;s one, with operating system which corresponds to PHPBoost&#39;s kernel and different software using the kernel that are modules. It works with a database. Now MySQL is required but we wish that we will be able to implement it also for SQLite, PostGreSQL and other DBMS. </p>

<p>PHPBoost can also be very useful to developers who don&#39;t want to program a full structure for their website. They can install PHPBoost kernel, maybe with modules already existing and if they don&#39;t find the module they need they can easily build their own module using PHPBoost&#39;s framework which contains many functions to make easier the development of modules. </p>

<p>To sum up, to build your website with PHPBoost you need a web server with Apache and a DataBase Managing System.</p>

 summary : <p>PHP File ListA PHP application that can be used to upload and share files on a web server. The idea is to keep it as simple as possible yet with a fresh and intuitive look. </p>

<p>HistoryThis project started when me and my IRC friends needed a place where we could share images and small files easily. I wrote a PHP script that let users upload files and display them in a simple list; PHP File List was born. </p>

<p>I have been adding features to the application every now and then for the last few years. I still intend for it to be as simple as possible, however the interface is stylish and security is an important factor. I created this Google Code project to finalize and share this application with the world. </p>

<p>Latest changesVersion 0.1 is released! </p>

<p>DocumentationInstallationDownload the latest release from the Downloads tab. Unzip the file and upload the contents to your web server. Open the index.php file and look for the Configuration block (near the top). Make sure you set the correct URL to where the application is installed ($FileListURL).

 summary : <p>Multithreaded DaemonMultiThreaded Daemon (MTD) is a kind of framework written in PHP5 that provide simple procedures to run background tasks in a multithreaded environnement. </p>

<p>Juste to be clear, I talk about multithreading in PHP but concurrent process should be more appropriate terms, because of the fork function used. </p>

<p>More precisely the framework is an abstract class that contains two abstract functions :  </p>

<p>abstract public function getNext($slot); abstract public function run($next, $slot); and lots of others functions which deal with the inter-process synchronization. </p>

<p>getNext($slot)This function will return the next element to process, or null if there is currently no job and the daemon should wait. </p>

<p>run($next, $slot)This second function is run in a separated thread (after forking) and take as argument the element to process (given by getNext). </p>

<p>Both function get an additionnal parameter slot which indicates where the thread will be executed </p>

 title : The phpvideotoolkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This class is a wrapper around the FFmpeg, FLVTools2 and Mencoder programs to allow PHP developers to manipulate and convert video files in any easy to use object oriented way. It also currently provides FFmpeg-PHP emulation in pure PHP so you wouldn&#39;t need to compile and install the module. Note, it isn&#39;t intended as a FFmpeg-PHP replacement, only an alternative solution and it is recommended that if you make heavy use of the FFmpeg-PHP functionality you should install the module as it is more efficient. </p>

<p>PHPVideoToolkit is pretty much the only video/audio class that you will need from now on. It performs several types of manipulation operations that include video format conversion, extract video frames into separate image files, assemble a video stream from a set of separate video images, extract audio from video, watermark videos and extracted frames. Several parameters can also be configured like the output video file format (which can be Flash video or any other supported by ffmpeg), video and audio bit rate and sample rate, video dimensions and aspect ratio. It can also retrieve information about the media file, such as duration, bitrate, framerate, format, dimensions, display aspect ratio, pixel aspect ratio, audio stereo, audio frequency and audio format, without any other additional library such as ffmpeg-php.</p>

 title : The phyml Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It provides a wide range of options that were designed to facilitate standard phylogenetic analyses. The main strengths of PhyML lies in the large number of substitution models coupled to various options to search the space  of phylogenetic tree topologies, going from very fast and efficient methods to slower but  generally more accurate approaches. It also implements two methods to evaluate branch supports in a sound statistical framework (the non-parametric bootstrap and the approximate likelihood ratio test).   PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In theory, alignments with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long can analyzed. In practice however, the amount of memory required to process a data set is proportional of the product of  the number of sequences by their length. Hence, a large number of sequences can only be processed provided that they are short. Also, PhyML can handle long sequences provided  that they are not numerous. With most standard personal computers, the “comfort zone” for PhyML generally lies around 3 to 500 sequences less than 2,000 character long. </p>

<p>NEWS! </p>

<p>The PhyML package now provides a tool called PhyTime that estimates divergence times using a fast Bayesian approach. PhyTime implements the methods described in the following article: </p>

<p>Guindon S., ``Bayesian estimation of divergence times from large sequence alignments&#39;&#39;, Molecular Biology and  Evolution, 2010.  </p>

<p>In order to use PhyTime, please download the development version of PhyML sources. A compressed archive of these files can be found on the righthand side of this page  by clicking on the phyml_dev_XXXX.tar.gz link.</p>

 summary : <p>Physaxe is a 2D Rigid Body Library written in haXe. It&#39;s been highly optimized for the Flash 9 Player, with the best optimizations available. </p>

<p>Physaxe is based on several existing physics engines, mainly : </p>

<p>Box2D, the reference open source physics engine Glaze, an AS3 engine which is a port of Chipmunk, itself based on Box2D </p>

<p>Physaxe features are : </p>

<p>rigid body consisting in several shapes shapes supported are circles, segments (with rounded edges) and arbitrary convex polygons customizable broadphase (currently bruteforce and y-sorted list are available) island resolution and sleeping (allow ~0 CPU to be spent when groups are sleeping) constraint solver based on Box2D sequential impulses customizable body properties, such as linear/angular friction and maximized motion </p>

 title : The physics2d Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Physics2D.Net is 2 dimensional rigid body physics engine written in C#. To work with XNA, Silverlight and .Net. </p>

<p>It is a complete rewrite of my original physics 2D found on source forge.    It is CLS compliant. Currently it has only one collision solver. The narrow phase collision detector is considered to be part of the solver.  The Solver is Sequential impulses with a distance grid used for narrow phase detection. There are 4 Broad phase detectors to choose from.  
<br/>Features: </p>

<p>Uses the split impulses solver from Box2D. This 2D Physics Engine is written entirely in C# and is optimized for C#. It has a wide range of Shapes and supports concave and convex polygons.  It has a large number of Methods to manipulate Polygons such as generating a polygon from a bitmap (sprite). The math library it uses (AdvanceMath) is written entirely in C# and is optimized for C#.  It uses a class called PhysicsLogic to implement a wide Range of effects from gravity to Maximum velocities.  Joints allow bodies to be tied together to make complex systems like ropes and rag dolls.  A large amount of parameter checking is done to reduce buggy implementations. Has a simple and elegant design.  It is Renderer independent, so it can be used with either Managed Direct X (MDX), XNA, OpenGl, WPF, SilverLight or another Renderer of your choice. (The Demo uses OpenGl) A very unrestrictive license (MIT) so you can use it for any kind of project. The code is well commented using C#’s XML comments.</p>

<p>usagePiHiPi compiler is a standalone command line utility that translates PiHiPi into valid php5 code. The resulting code can be executed or deployed directly, no additional libraries or extensions are required. </p>

<p>phicc -o source.ph ... source.phtranslates given PiHiPi (.ph) files into one single php script. If -o option is omitted, phicc prints generated code to standard output, so that you can pipe it with php: </p>

<p>phicc source.ph | phpThere&#39;s also a shell script, called phi, that does essentially the same: </p>

<p>phi source.phcompiles and then executes source.ph </p>

<p>installationwindows binariesDownload and unzip windows package. Put phicc.exe somewhere in your path, and phrtl.php in your php include_path. Run tests to make sure everything is ok: </p>

<p>php test.phpAfter running tests, it&#39;s safe to remove installation directory, phicc.exe and phrtl.php are only two files you need to use PiHiPi. </p>

 summary : <p>Pkgman is used to maintain the desired software package state on all of your 
<br/>solaris hosts.  Add the package names to the configuration file and 
<br/>indicate what hosts the package applies to and whether it should be installed  
<br/>or removed.  Run pkgman on a host and point it to the configuration file 
<br/>and pkgman will determine which package records apply to the executing host. 
<br/>For further information please consult the http://pkgman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README 
<br/>file which currently contains all of the documentation. 
<br/>To download pkgman you can grab the gzipped tarball marked &quot;latest stable version&quot;  
<br/>from the download list http://code.google.com/p/pkgman/downloads/list.   Currently  
<br/>the name for the gzipped tarball ball is pkgman-.tar.gz.   When you 
<br/>gunzip/untar the archive you will end up with a directory called pkgman-.      
<br/>The README file included in the tar archive has a section titled &quot;INSTALLATION&quot; which   
<br/>covers the details of installing pkgman.   It basically says to execute the command  
<br/>&quot;ruby setup.rb&quot; while you are in the directory created after you unpacked the tarball.

 summary : <p>This tiny Objective-C library allows you to send and receive asynchronous messages between processes or threads akin to the Erlang concurrency approach. </p>

<p>Plankton is thus an actor oriented peer-to-peer platform for asynchronous share-nothing message passing. </p>

<p>Messages can be any Objective-C objects which represent property-lists. Plankton uses the Cocoa property-list encoding for the on-the-wire representation. Message reception is done via the NSPredicate facility of Coca which allows for sophisticated pattern specifications. </p>

<p>Usage of Plankton should be easy: </p>

<p>create a PLPlatform object and cling to it </p>

<p>PLPlatform *platform = [[PLPlatform alloc] init];create your own actor-id NSString *aid = [platform createAid];send a message to another actor (you need its aid for that) [platform send:message to:otherAid];prepare reception of  messages from other actors PLPattern *pattern = [[PLPattern patternWithPredicateFormat:@&quot;SELF in {&#39;quit&#39;, &#39;exit&#39;}&quot;] retain];

 title : The plantae Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Plantae is a web-based database of ecological and evolutionary data for plants. The success and utility of web projects, such as Entrez and Treebase demonstrate the power of collaboration on the submission of and access to data. Our goal for Plantae is that it relieves evolutionary ecologists from the burden of collecting and maintaining private databases of relevant plant traits. Rather, as data is discovered it is submitted to the Plantae project and made available to all researchers. We all gain access to a growing collection of data that is easily searched, annotated, and updated.</p>

<p>Plantae’s creation was guided by three principles to ensure the scientific utility of the project:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Open access: We do not restrict access to the website for people who want to search or view the plants and their associated traits. Anyone with access to a web browser can benefit from the data within Plantae.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Collaboration: Plantae’s usefulness increases with researchers’ contributions. Consequently, we encourage people to add data to Plantae. Although we do ask that they register before doing so to track collaborations and provide some control over the database. We also welcome suggestions for the addition of new traits to Plantae. We began with traits that were relevant to our particular research goals, but hope to cover all relevant plant traits with help from the community. Finally, we provide links to other web-based projects (e.g., iSpecies) whenever appropriate to link Plantae’s data with other efforts.
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3. Scholarship: To ensure that Plantae contains accurate data, we require that each submission be accompanied by a peer-reviewed citation. These citations are managed by Nature Magazine’s Connotea project which further encourages collaboration among the users of Plantae. This decision ensures that any data contained within Plantae is as accurate as the primary literature and the linked citations can be queried for additional information on the study’s design and implementation.</p>

<p>Plantae is written in the Ruby programming language and relies on the Ruby on Rails web framework and sqlite3 database. Consequently, Plantae is constructed with open-source software. Furthermore, the source code for Plantae itself is also governed by an open-source license and available from</p>

 summary : <p>Right now, this is a side project, an exercise in programming language design and implementation.  It could become more, if I keep liking it. </p>

<p>Main goals: readable without training to English speakers who know one or two other programming languages, clean enough to use for large projects, and powerful enough that those large projects are concise.  I want to make a hybrid of object-oriented and functional programming styles natural. </p>

<p>The influences I currently see most in what I&#39;m doing include Python, Scheme, and Java, with dashes of Ruby from time to time.</p>

It can operate on each element in parallel, for IO-bound operations, on sublists in parallel, for taking advantage of multi-core machines with CPU-bound operations, and across erlang nodes, for parallizing inside a cluster. It handles errors and node failures. It can be configured, tuned, and tweaked to get optimal performance while minimizing overhead. </p>

<p>Almost all the functions are identical to equivalent functions in lists, returning exactly the same result, and having both a form with an identical syntax that operates on each element in parallel and a form which takes an optional &quot;malt&quot;, a specification for how to parallize the operation. </p>

<p>fold is the one exception, parallel fold is different from linear fold. This module also include a simple mapreduce implementation, and the function runmany. All the other functions are implemented with runmany, which is as a generalization of parallel list operations. </p>

<p>Documentation is available at http://freeyourmind.googlepages.com/plists.html, and a blog post with some examples at http://plists.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/introducing-plists-an-erlang-module-for-doing-list-operations-in-parallel/.</p>

 title : The pluralize-for-gettext Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>PluralizeForGettextThis plugin inspects a single string to get pluralization with substitution. The reason I use a single string is to keep it recognizable for gettext or similar i12n plugins. </p>

<p>Although I created this plugin for gettext, it can be used whenever you like. If you&#39;re not using gettext, _(&quot;string&quot;).pluralize_for becomes &quot;string&quot;.pluralize_for... Simple enough... </p>

<p>Please visit http://infx.nl for more information and updates </p>

<p>Installation./script/plugin install http://pluralize-for-gettext.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/And then rename vendor/plugins/svn to vendor/plugins/pluralize_for_gettext </p>

<p>ExamplesA bit better looking: </p>

<p>  &lt;%=_(&#39;No posts ~~ Only one post ~~ You have {$N} posts!&#39;).pluralize_for(Post.count) %&gt;Clearer for the translator: </p>

<p>  &lt;%=_(&#39;~~$N==0: No posts ~~$N==1: Only one post ~~else: You have {$N} posts&#39;).pluralize_for(Post.count)%&gt;Note: The translator can change the logic for this, for languages with weird pluralization rules. ;) Caution: It&#39;s being eval&#39;ed, so always check language files (or ruby code) for any Ruby injections. </p>

<p>Substituting more variablesWhy not use the default sprintf-like function from rails? </p>

<p>  &lt;%_(&#39;You have %d posts, view %s&#39;) % [ Post.count, link_to(_(&#39;more&#39;), view_more_url)%&gt;You&#39;d get multiple entries in you .po file, and just &#39;more&#39; can&#39;t be translated differently according to the context. </p>

<p>More advanced, for entering links </p>

<p>  &lt;%=_(&#39;No posts, create one by clicking {1:here} ~~ Only one post ~~ You have {$N} posts ~~$N&gt;6: You have {$N} posts, view {2:more}&#39;).pluralize_for(Post.count) do |i|
<br/>    i[1] = link_to(i[1], create_post_url) if i[1]
<br/>    i[2] = link_to(i[2], view_more_url) if i[2]
<br/>  %&gt;In the .po file: </p>

<p>  #: app/controllers/some_controller.rb:102
<br/>  msgid &quot;No posts, create one by clicking {1:here} ~~ Only one post ~~ You have {$N} posts ~$N&gt;6~ You have {$N} posts, view {2:more}&quot;
<br/>  msgstr &quot;Geen artikelen, {1:plaats een artikel} ~~ Slechts een artikel ~~ Je hebt {$N} artikelen ~$N&gt;6~ Je hebt {$N} artikelen ({2:bekijk meer...})&quot;The numbers in {1:foo} are the keys for the array you&#39;re given. You can adjust it anyway you like. </p>

<p>Simple pluralizationsPerhaps you just want to specify a singular and plural for one word in the entire sentence: </p>

<p>  &lt;%=_(&#39;You have {$N} {post|posts}&#39;).pluralize_for(Post.count)%&gt;English is simpler than many other languages, so the translator could change it into the more elaborate version: </p>

<p>  #: app/controllers/some_controller.rb:102
<br/>  msgid &quot;You have {$N} {post|posts}&quot;
<br/>  msgstr &quot;~~$N==0: Helemaal geen artikelen ~~$N==1: U heeft een artikel ~~$N&gt;1: U heeft {$N} artikelen&quot;</p>

 title : The pocle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Latest version: Processor of OCL 2.0 expressions v1.3 </p>

<p>Our aim is to develop a tool that converts textual constraints written in the OCL 2.0 language into instances of the OCL 2.0 metamodel. To do this we base our design in the existent tool called Dresden OCL2 Toolkit, from the Dresden University. </p>

<p>By now, our implementation support almost all OCL 2.0 constructions, including the inverse conversion from metamodel instances to textual constraints. </p>

<p>We use as a conceptual modeling environment the EINA GMC tool, which can be found in http://guifre.lsi.upc.edu/eina_GMC/ </p>

<p>Such tool is developed by the GMC Research Group of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), from Spain. It provides the possibility of creating and storing metamodel instances into a MDR repository. </p>

<p>The steps of our processor are the followings: </p>

<p>Load an XMI file containing the description of a conceptual schema Write OCL constraints related to the previous schema Parse the OCL expressions Throw error messages if any problem is found during the parsing process If no errors, create instances for the previous constraints into the MDR repository Our project is developed in Java.</p>
 title : The pocogese Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pocogeseis short for &quot;POST Commands and GET Selections&quot;. </p>

<p>Pocogese implements the concept of Commands and Selections applied to the remote invocation of Services from Adobe Flex applications. This design choice is based on the observation that most Services either read or manipulate Resources.  </p>

<p>Reading is realized by sending GET requests with Selections ; these should not change the state of the Resource requested. Selections return with a single Resource or a list of Resources based on some selection criteria. Manipulation is realized by sending POST requests with Commands ; these change the state of one or multiple Resources. Typical commands include create,update and delete, but any other modifying action can be modeled this way. Commands return with information about the status of the manipulation and may include one result and explanation messages. Current implementation uses POX (Plain Old XML) for data transport. AMF3 could be a future alternative. Take a look at the source </p>

<p>Subproject: Pocogese-RailsPocogese-Rails provides a Ruby on Rails plugin that extends ActiveController to dispatch both commands and selections. In addition, this plugin includes a Rake task to support the generation of Flex controller clients. </p>

<p>After RailsPluginInstall and FlexLibraryInstall, you start with SetupRailsService, then GenerateFlexFromRails and finally CallServiceFromFlex to make it work. </p>

<p>Subproject: Pocogese-JavaPocogese-Java provides a Servlet-based implementation of a controller dispatcher that can handle commands and selections. A Servlet receives invocations which are dispatched to registered !Controllers. In addition, this library includes a FlexGenerator to support the generation of Flex controller clients. </p>

<p>After JavaLibraryInstall and FlexLibraryInstall, you start with SetupJavaService, then GenerateFlexFromJava and finally CallServiceFromFlex to make it work. </p>

<p>Subproject: Pocogese-TestPocogese-Test provides FlexUnit testcases and a TestRunner to test components and classes from Pocogese. Unit tests for other subprojects (Rails and Java) are included in their own project structure. This project requires the flexunit library. </p>

<p>Materialized Views SupportThis is a project sponsored by Google for the Open Source Geospatial Foundation as part of the Summer of Code 2007. </p>

<p>BackgroundPostGIS geometry processing functions consume machine&#39;s CPU resources. This behavior can be avoided creating &#39;snapshots&#39; of data based on views definitions, making queries more light for clients. This is specially useful for web clients.  </p>

<p>Jonathan Gardner have aboard this problem with the concept of Materialized Views. These functions may be improved to support PostGIS functionality when creating, refreshing or deleting views. </p>

<p>ProposalNew functions for: </p>

<p>Add/Modify/Drop simple views Add/Modify/Drop materialized views Materialize simple views Refresh data of materialized views </p>

<p>MilestonesMilestones has been posted on this calendar. </p>

<p>KML outputHistoryWe use PostGIS to store vector data in PostgreSQL databases. This data is exposed in web clients like MapServer or desktop clients like QGIS or uDIG. However, Google Earth have growth as a better desktop client to show this data specially for people who never heard about GIS or maps. </p>

<p>PostGIS lacked of this functionality before version 1.2.1. This feature had been requested for many users but had not been included. At this point is where the magic of Open Source comes. I decided write this piece of code of a function for PostGIS that exposes geometry as KML objects. This code was reviewed by the guys at Refractions and committed on December 2006. Officially, AsKML() appears on 1.2.1 release of PostGIS. </p>

<p>There are many people using this function. Last January I heard of a course implementing this techniques here in Colombia! </p>

<p>AsKML (now ST_AsKML) function do not produce full featured KML documents. It just expose the geometry elements as KML objects to be included in programming interfaces in PHP and other client interfaces supported by PostgreSQL. </p>

<p>AdvantagesExposing &quot;live&quot; data for users. Instead of export static ESRI shapefiles We can create feeds of changing data reflecting live events  Process to convert vector data to KML geometry is done by database UsagePython Php New FeaturesExtrude Tesselate and Altitudemode Support People using ST_AsKMLOnline Soil Survey - California Soil Resource Lab. Press note The Timoney Group   FutureST_AsKML would be extended to support attributes?

 summary : <p>A golf contest is a programming contest where the winner is the coder who writes the shortest program to complete a task. This tool was designed to help Postscript golfers in golfing competitions such as http://golf.shinh.org. </p>

<p>It reads a postscript program and outputs a new program where tokens are converted to binary form in an attempt to reduce the byte size of the program. Features include: </p>

<p>Unnecessary whitespace is removed. Comments are removed. Operators such as &#39;add&#39; and &#39;length&#39; are reduced to their two byte binary representation. Tokens are not converted to binary if doing so would increase their length. Strings with escape codes such as (\n) are converted to strings containing the equivalent binary characters. Optional mode: binary tokens are not allowed. Limitations: </p>

<p>Embedding data in the program and reading it using (for example) &#39;currentfile 100 string readline&#39; is not handled. For longer files (300 bytes+) it might be worth gzipping the program, but this is not supported. To attempt to reduce the size of a Postscript program, run the following command: </p>

<p>./psgolftool.py &lt; program.ps &gt; program.bin.ps </p>

<p>To disallow binary characters: </p>

<p>./psgolftool.py nobin &lt; program.ps &gt; program.nobin.ps</p>

 summary : <p>Barcode Writer in Pure Postscript implements the printing of all major barcode formats entirely within level 2 PostScript, so that the process of converting the input string into the printed output is performed by the printer itself. This avoids the need to re-implement the barcode generation process whenever your language needs change.  </p>

<p>Log4PostSharp: trace your programs using a single custom attribute. Log4PostSharp emits optimal instructions for you. Yes, just like hand-tuned code! PostSharp4Unity: Mark classes as configurable and start enjoying Unity without the factory method! Old plain constructor still work. PostSharpAspNet: Enables to use PostSharp in ASP.NET projects even with JIT compilation. DesignByContract: transparently adds preconditions, postconditions and invariant to methods and classes. Just beginning, a lot of work to do. Awareness: makes PostSharp Laos aware of serialization (BinaryFormatter and WCF). GSharp: One of the classic uses of AOP is to automate logging.  But an unfortunate side-effect of logging everywhere is massive log files that are hard to read, hard to dig around in, and sometimes hard to just open without running out of memory. GSharp aspects let you trace your programs as well as log exceptions and profile performance.  You can then analyze and graph your data with Gibraltar.</p>

<br/>===========</p>

<p>A nice and DRY sort of way of displaying your flash[:notice] or flash[:error].  Major credit to doing this type of thing in the first place to the crew at JadedPixel.  They are doing this in Shopify (http://www.shopify.com), which is an awesome product.  And also in the open source forum software they made called Opinion.  I recommend checking both out.</p>

<p>Just install the plugin:</p>

<p>ruby script/plugin install http://prettyflash.googlecode.com/svn/pretty_flash/</p>

<p>And as long as you have the default javascript include tag () in your layouts header, you will start seeing pretty DHTML flash notices and errors whenever you stick something in flash[:error] or flash[:notice] and render a javascript update or an entire page.</p>

<p>I leave it up to you though to have to delete all your  blocks. :)</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it just:</p>

<p>ruby script/plugin remove pretty_flash</p>

 title : The proaudio Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>As of 14th May 2009, we are in the phase of migrating to http://archaudio.org as we port most of the packages here. At this point of time, updates may only be available from the AUR and the packages&#39; respective maintainers there. However, you may continue to post bug reports here as we don&#39;t yet have a proper framework for that at the new site. We apologise for the inconvenience, if any at all. </p>

<p>These packages are not supported by Arch Linux. This is a third-party community project compatible with the Arch Linux repositories including unsupported (AUR), but excluding testing (at the moment at least). We also upload our packages to the AUR, but due to the dependency on one maintainer, we provide the central location where a team of community members can develop and maintain them together. </p>

<p>The emphasis is on providing the latest releases (and techonology where applicable) in a timely fashion via a rolling-release schedule, based on Subversion checkouts and comfortable user-developer interaction via the Google Code project management facilities. Currently there are two binary mirrors, of which one may not be online. These mirrors, however, will not always be up-to-date and may contain other packages. </p>

<p>We cater to software that are recognised as being useful for audio/music engineering/production, and aid other Arch Linux package maintainers/developers of such software by uploading updated versions of their packages when they are broken (users are unable to build themselves) and out-of-date. Another reason for hosting packages already being maintained by an Arch Linux developer or Trusted User is different resulting binaries due to different configurations. </p>

<p>We will also be providing the latest releases of possibly untested and unstable software that may qualify as being important for a working environment (eg. freebob, ffado). As such, not all of these packages will build or work as expected. </p>

<p>Download details are available on the &quot;Source&quot; link above and you can ask questions in the proaudio-users group, or get more involved with packaging and apply for upload privileges in proaudio-devel. There is also an IRC chat group #archlinux-proaudio on the irc.freenode.org network and an ongoing discussion thread in the Arch Linux forums. Have a look at the Source page for a partial list of packages (the command below will list all of them), we look forward to your reports, ideas and suggestions. </p>

<p>~$ svn list http://proaudio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Note: To have upload privileges you will need a Google ID (eg. Gmail) and then notify us that you want to be added as a project member, after which you can log in to this page and view your SVN password from the &quot;Settings&quot; link. Not many users have the need for these software, but even so, we would appreciate it if you could help keep the project active - and most importantly - updated.</p>

 summary : <p>What is ProfitPy?ProfitPy is a set of libraries and tools for the development, testing, and execution of automated stock trading systems Specifically, ProfitPy is a collection of Python packages, modules, and scripts that work together to help you implement an automated stock trading program (or programs). The package features:  </p>

<p>A library with classes for accounts, orders, tickers, and more A GUI program for executing and plotting trades in real-time A GUI tool to collect ticker data for off-line use A CLI tool to back-test trading strategies Dozens of technical indicators and plotting widgets to display them An X11 keystroke tool for automating the TWS application No, really, what is it?ProfitPy is my trading toolkit. I use its collector tool to gather data from IB TWS. Using this data, I run the coverage tool to test my trading strategies. Once I&#39;m happy with a strategy, it gets executed with the main GUI program.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t include any trading strategies that work -- those are for you to write.  </p>

<p>This toolkit only works with one broker, Interactive Brokers. Their TWS application and its API, along with crazy-low commissions and fees, make for many, many trading opportunities.</p>

<p>Project zombie is a game based on the simulation of zombies on the GPU. Graphics will be simple. However, we will strive to make the graphics &quot;interesting looking.&quot; With regard to the term &quot;interesting looking,&quot; an inspiration of ours is the game Darwina. We are not saying our game&#39;s graphics will be based on the Darwina look, but rather, we try to achieve the idea presented in Darwina. We believe Darwina has that particular &quot;simplistic but interesting&quot; notion, which we hope to emulate.  </p>

<p>Another goal of PZ will be the implementation of cellular automaton based effects; we use CA to fake physical based effects, effects that affect the environment, in &quot;interesting&quot; ways. </p>

<p>Finally, our ultimate goal is to create an interesting game where the player battles massive hordes of zombie. We hope by injecting massive crowds, we will see emergent based game-play. This is our hope! Hence the reason for this project, to experiment!</p>

 summary : <p>Sinalização de QoS no Modelo RM Diffserv é um tema de projeto de fim de curso, do Curso Superior de Tecnologia em Sistemas de Telecomunicações </p>

<p>Este projeto visa implantar uma arquitetura de sinalização para o modelo RM Diffserv e integrá-la com um controle de admissão e controle de recursos a ser implementado através de simulação de gerenciamento. </p>

<p>O modelo DiffServ (Serviços diferenciados) provê diferenciação de fluxos, manipulando diferentes classes de tráfego. Fluxos individuais são agregados e associados a uma classe de tráfego, permitindo escalabilidade dos serviços na rede. </p>

<p>O DiffServ cria domínios, conjunto de roteadores, que disponibilizam serviços diferenciados de comunicação IP. A marcação da Qos é feita utilizando os bits TOS do IPv4 e os roteadores utilizam esses bits para identificar como os pacotes serão tratados na rede. </p>

<p>Para o gerenciamento do DiffServ, utilizaremos o RM Diffserv, que é uma proposição para o gerenciamento dinâmico de domínios diffserv. Ela preenche a lacuna apontada anteriormente no modelo diffserv no sentido de permitir a alocação eficiente de recursos em um domínio. </p>

<p>EtapasEstudar o modelo de QoS RM Diffserv; </p>

 title : The protobuf-c Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewThis package provides a code generator and runtime libraries to use Protocol Buffers from pure C (not C++). </p>

<p>It uses a modified version of protoc called protoc-c. </p>

<p>NewsMar 17, 2010protobuf-c 0.13 is released </p>

<p>Fix for when the number of connections gets too great in RPC.  (Leszek Swirski) (&amp;nbsp;issue #32&amp;nbsp;) Add --disable-protoc to only build libprotobuf-c (daveb) Bug fixes for protobuf_c_enum_descriptor_get_value_by_name() and protobuf_c_service_descriptor_get_method_by_name() use generated initialization function from protobuf_c_message_unpack(), a small optimization (daveb) implement protobuf_c_{client,server}_set_error_handler() </p>

<p>Jan 24, 2010 protobuf-c 0.12 is released </p>

<p>fixes some compilation bugs and big-endian platform issues (thanks, everyone!) adds protobuf_c_message_init() (thanks to Andrei Nigmatulin for this work) </p>

<p>Jun 11, 2009protobuf-c 0.11 is released. </p>

<p>mostly compilation fixes for new versions of g++ and protobuf, and a few other compilation issues (e.g. const correctness)  (Many thanks to dcreager, XXX name others) handle a few integer overflow situations a little better (unlikely to occur -- requires unpacking a huge message) no binary or source incompatibilities -- don&#39;t bother upgrading unless you are experiencing build problems </p>

<p>Apr 4, 2009protobuf-c 0.10 is released (don&#39;t ask about 0.9...) </p>

<p>several bug fixes for corruption and build issues numerous fixes to the RPC system generated source-incompatibility for service/rpc users:  you must re-run protoc-c (those using 0.9 or 10beta already have the new code-generator). credits: (thanks!) Jason Lunz for his allocation failure fixes (including excellent test code) Landon Fuller for his corruption test-cases and fixes. </p>

<p>Jan 29, 2009protobuf-c 0.8 is released </p>

<p>bugs fixed in service invocation; handle NULL in certain required fields (issues 12 and 13) An RPC_System is included, with tests and examples.  It&#39;s in beta, so be a little careful. </p>

<p>Dec 17, 2008protobuf-c 0.7 is released.  This is a bug fix release, it does not break any compatibility. </p>

<p>Bugs fixed: </p>

<p>fixes minor compilation issues (see issues 10 and 11 in the tracker) fixes a long-standing memory leak where unknown fields are not freed by free_unpacked() </p>

<p>Nov 30, 2008protobuf-c 0.6 is released.  It breaks binary and generated-source compatibility:  you must re-run protoc-c to generate new .pb-c.h and .pb-c.c files. </p>

<p>The new features of 0.6 are: </p>

<p>default values now set correctly For each message type, we generate a message__init(Message *) function.  This function never allocates memory, and is equivalent to using the MESSAGE__INIT macro. </p>

<p>DocumentationSee our wiki for documentation. </p>

<p>StatusThe message serialization and deserialization code has been thoroughly tested. Still designing the Service stuff, so be careful about using it. Need to decide what to do about extensions CaveatsSome binary compatibility changes are expected until version 1.0 is released; so make sure you are linking to the protobuf-c that corresponds to the generated code you are using! </p>

<p>Extensions are not implemented.   Need to decide what to implement (any ideas?).  (As of Jun 20, 2009, there are no complaints about this) </p>

<p>Groups are not implemented, and possibly I never will bother, since they are deprecated. </p>

<p>Repeated fields do not obey the &quot;packed&quot; option.  (I INTEND TO FIX THIS, BUT PATCHES TO THIS EFFECT WOULD BE APPRECIATED VERY MUCH) </p>

 title : The protobuf-mercury Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a Mercury backend for the Google protocol buffers compiler. </p>

<p>What it doesProtocol buffers allow you to define an extensible binary protocol format in a language-independent .proto file.  The protocol buffer compiler then compiles your .proto file into one of several target languages.  The generated API gives you a type-safe way to read or write messages in your protocol using your preferred language(s). </p>

<p>This extension generates a Mercury API for a protocol defined in a .proto file. </p>

<p>ExampleSay you define the following protocol in person.proto: </p>

<p>enum Gender {
<br/>    MALE = 0;
<br/>    FEMALE = 1;
<br/>}</p>

<p>enum MaritalStatus {
<br/>    MARRIED = 0;
<br/>    SINGLE = 1;
<br/>}</p>

<p>message Person {
<br/>    required int32 id = 1;
<br/>    required string name = 2;
<br/>    required Gender gender = 3;
<br/>    required double double= 4;
<br/>    optional string email = 5;
<br/>    optional MaritalStatus marital_status = 6 [default = SINGLE];
<br/>    repeated Person children = 7;
<br/>}Then you can generate the Mercury module person.m with the command: </p>

<p>mprotoc person.proto --out .The generated module will contain the following types and functions: </p>

<p>:- type person
<br/>    ---&gt;    person(
<br/>                person_id :: int,
<br/>                person_name :: string,
<br/>                person_gender :: gender,
<br/>                person_double :: float,
<br/>                person_email :: maybe(string),
<br/>                person_marital_status :: maybe(marital_status),
<br/>                person_children :: list(person)
<br/>            ).</p>

<p>:- func person_email_or_default(person) = string.</p>

<p>:- func person_marital_status_or_default(person) = marital_status.</p>

<p>:- type gender
<br/>    ---&gt;    gender_male
<br/>    ;       gender_female.</p>

<p>:- type marital_status
<br/>    ---&gt;    marital_status_married
<br/>    ;       marital_status_single.You can write values of type person to binary streams.  For example: </p>

<p>    Person = person( 
<br/>        1, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, gender_male, 1.8, yes(&quot;pp@neverland.org&quot;), no,
<br/>            [
<br/>                person(2, &quot;Peter Pan Jnr.&quot;, gender_male, 0.5, no,
<br/>                    yes(marital_status_single), [])
<br/>            ]),
<br/>    stream.put(pb_writer(Stream), pb_message(Person), !IO),You can also read values of type person from binary streams.  For example: </p>

<p>    stream.get(pb_reader(Stream, 10000), GetRes, !IO),
<br/>    ( GetRes = ok(pb_message(Person)),
<br/>        % Do something with Person...</p>

 title : The protobuf-perlxs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Protocol Buffers for Perl/XSThis project contains a Perl/XS code generator for Google&#39;s  Protocol Buffers.  The generated code is an XS wrapper around the generated C++ classes, and includes POD documentation for each message type. </p>

<p>Getting StartedLet&#39;s assume that you already know what Protocol Buffers are, and have downloaded, built, and installed the main protobuf package.  This gives you the core code generators (in particular, the C++ code generator, which we need), as well as various header files and the libprotoc library.  These are all dependencies for protobuf-perlxs, so you need to be sure that they&#39;re installed. </p>

<p>Next, download and install the protobuf-perlxs code: </p>

<p> wget http://protobuf-perlxs.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-perlxs-1.0.tar.gz
<br/> tar zxf protobuf-perlxs-1.0.tar.gz
<br/> cd protobuf-perlxs-1.0
<br/> ./configure --with-protobuf=/usr/local
<br/> make
<br/> sudo make installIn the sample instructions above, we assume that your protobuf headers and libraries are installed under /usr/local.  If you&#39;ve installed them under /usr, you don&#39;t need the --with-protobuf argument. </p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve installed protobuf-perlxs, you can invoke the protoxs executable, which gives you the ability to generate Perl/XS wrapper interfaces to protobuf messages.  To see a simple example, try this after you&#39;ve installed protoxs: </p>

<p> cd examples/simple
<br/> perl Makefile.PL
<br/> make
<br/> make testThis example gives you a Perl interface to the following message definition: </p>

<p> message Person {
<br/>   required int32 id = 1;
<br/>   required string name = 2;
<br/>   optional string email = 3;
<br/> }You can read the generated POD documentation for the Person message in the usual way: </p>

<p> perldoc PersonThis documentation shows you what constructors and methods are available for that message type.  Typical usage for the simple example we&#39;re using here might be something like the following: </p>

<p>    #!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p>    use strict;
<br/>    use warnings;
<br/>    use Person;</p>

<p>    my $person = Person-&gt;new;</p>

<p>    # Set each of the fields.</p>

<p>    $person-&gt;set_id($id);
<br/>    $person-&gt;set_name($name);
<br/>    $person-&gt;set_email($email);</p>

<p>    # Serialize the object to a string.</p>

<p>    my $packed = $person-&gt;pack();</p>

<p>    # Clear the object contents.</p>

<p>    $person-&gt;clear();</p>

<p>    # Deserialize the object from the string.</p>

<p>    $person-&gt;unpack($packed);</p>

<p>    # Get each of the fields.</p>

<p>    $id = $person-&gt;id();
<br/>    $name = $person-&gt;name();
<br/>    $email = $person-&gt;email();This is a contrived example.  However, the performance is quite good.  It takes only 0.2 seconds for 10,000 iterations through the Perl code shown above (20 microseconds per iteration) on a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 CPU, whereas the same number of Storable freeze/thaw iterations on the same data takes 0.7 seconds.  Storable is the fastest general-purpose Perl serialization module, and it is outperformed here by a considerable margin.   </p>

<p>How you can use itReally, this is up to you.  You have to decide whether you are willing to tolerate the extra work that is required in order to get your Perl/XS interfaces up and running.  If you prefer to work in a pure-Perl environment without any XS code, you may want to have a look at the protobuf-perl project. </p>

<p>If you want the best performance possible and are willing to jump through some extra hoops to get it, read on.  Depending on the sophistication of your usage of Protocol Buffers, you have a few options: </p>

<p>Entry levelYou can generate and compile Perl/XS and C++ code together from protobuf message definitions.  This is the approach taken in the example that is supplied with the source code.  A single call to protoxs on a single message definition generates all of the source files that are needed, and a fairly simple Makefile.PL can be used to build the Perl package.  In fact, with the person.proto message definition shown above, the corresponding Makefile.PL can be reproduced here in its entirety: </p>

<p>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;</p>

<p>$CC = &#39;g++&#39;;</p>

<p># Generate the C++, XS, and Perl files that we need.</p>

<p>my $protoxs = &quot;protoxs --cpp_out=. --out=. person.proto&quot;;</p>

<p>print &quot;Generating C++ and Perl/XS sources...\n&quot;;
<br/>print &quot;$protoxs\n&quot;;</p>

<p>`$protoxs`;</p>

<p># Now write the Makefile.</p>

<p>WriteMakefile(
<br/>              &#39;NAME&#39;          =&gt; &#39;Person&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;VERSION_FROM&#39;  =&gt; &#39;Person.pm&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;OPTIMIZE&#39;      =&gt; &#39;-O2 -Wall&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;CC&#39;            =&gt; $CC,
<br/>              &#39;LD&#39;            =&gt; &#39;$(CC)&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;CCFLAGS&#39;       =&gt; &#39;-fno-strict-aliasing&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;OBJECT&#39;        =&gt; &#39;person.pb.o Person.o&#39;,
<br/>              &#39;TYPEMAPS&#39;      =&gt; [&#39;Person.typemap&#39;],
<br/>              &#39;INC&#39;           =&gt;  &quot; -I/usr/local/include&quot;,
<br/>              &#39;LIBS&#39;          =&gt; [&quot; -L/usr/local/lib -lprotobuf&quot;],
<br/>              &#39;XSOPT&#39;         =&gt; &#39;-C++&#39;,
<br/>              clean           =&gt; { FILES =&gt; &quot;Person.* person.pb.* lib&quot; }
<br/>             );
<br/>Next levelWhile the entry level approach might get you started, you may find at a certain point that your messages start having dependencies on other messages (imports).  If you have multiple &quot;top-level&quot; message types that share dependency on one or more other message types, the entry level compilation method will result in duplicate copies of the dependent code.  This is not a fatal problem, as the Perl/XS modules are built into dynamic objects that are dlopened by the Perl interpreter.  You should not run into any symbol conflicts.  However, you may wish instead to build a shared library out of the generated C++ code, and link your Perl/XS wrapper code with this shared library.  In this case, you will need to generate and compile the C++ shared object first, then generate, compile, and link the Perl/XS wrapper.  Since I myself am still at the Entry level with Protocol Buffers, I do not yet have an example of this &quot;Next level&quot; approach. </p>

<p>What works nowAs of now, all of the data types are supported, including enums and embedded messages.  Imports are also supported. </p>

<p>What doesn&#39;t work yetExtensions are not yet supported, nor is the RPC interface.  I plan to add support for Extensions next.  After that, I will look at the RPC interface. </p>

<p>Other things that need to be addedWe have been assigned a field ID of 1001 for custom options in protobuf-perlxs.  This will make it possible to specify file-level, message-level, and even field-level options that are recognized by protobuf-perlxs.  As of now, we have an immediate need to use these custom options, since more sophisticated package and message layouts in Perl/XS will require the suppression of certain .pm files from the output, the generation of others, and so on.  There will undoubtedly be other reasons to use custom options to customize the behavior of protobuf-perlxs on the .proto files that it processes.</p>

 summary : <p>This is a port of Proxy Revealer 2.0.1 MOD (phpBB2) to phpBB3. Attempts to determine someone&#39;s &quot;real&quot; IP address, using a myriad of techniques, and &quot;blocks&quot; such people. Original techniques included XSS, Java, and X_FORWARDED_FOR checks. In this port, Flash has been added as yet another unmasking technique. There maybe additional techniques added on later. </p>

<p>Features: </p>

<p>HTTP(S)/SOCKS Proxy Detection by Flash and Java applet techniques, and optional blocking. Optional blocking of transparent HTTP Proxies detected with X_FORWARDED_FOR technique. CGI-Proxy Detection by XSS and Flash techniques, and optional blocking. Optional auto-banning of unmasked IP addresses with the chosen blocking techniques above. Blocking/Banning done within the confines of phpBB3&#39;s &quot;Session IP Validation&quot; setting in the ACP. Auto-Logging masked/unmasked IP addresses with possible extended info if Flash/Java was used. Optional Exception List Management for excluding particular proxy servers you may be running.

 summary : <p>#!/usr/bin/perl -- # #   CGIProxy 2.0.1 # #   nph-proxy.cgi-- CGIProxy 2.0.1: a proxy in the form of a CGI script. #     Retrieves the resource at any HTTP or FTP URL, updating embedded URLs #     in HTML resources to point back through this script.  By default, no #     user info is sent to the server.  Options include text-only proxying #     to save bandwidth, cookie filtering, ad filtering, script removal, #     user-defined encoding of the target URL, and more.  Requires Perl 5. # #   Copyright (C) 1996, 1998-2002 by James Marshall, james@jmarshall.com #   All rights reserved. # #   For the latest, see http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ # # #   IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ANONYMOUS BROWSING: #     CGIProxy was originally made for indirect browsing more than #       anonymity, but since people are using it for anonymity, I&#39;ve tried #       to make it as anonymous as possible.  Suggestions welcome.  For best #       anonymity, browse with JavaScript turned off.  In fact, that&#39;s the #       only reliable way, in spite of what certain anonymity vendors claim. #     Anonymity is pretty good, but may not be bulletproof.  For example, #       if even a single JavaScript statement can be run, your anonymity can #       be compromised.  I&#39;ve tried to remove JS from every place it can #       exist, but please tell me if I missed any.  Also, browser plugins or #       other executable extensions may be able to reveal you to a server. #     If you find any way your anonymity can be compromised even with scripts #       turned off, please let me know. # # #   CONFIGURATION: # #     None required in most situations.  On some servers, these might be #       required (all in the &quot;user configuration&quot; section): #       . If you&#39;re using another HTTP or SSL proxy, set $HTTP_PROXY, #           $SSL_PROXY, and $NO_PROXY as needed.  If those proxies use #           authentication, set $PROXY_AUTH and $SSL_PROXY_AUTH accordingly. #       . If this is running on an SSL server that doesn&#39;t use port 443, set #           $RUNNING_ON_SSL_SERVER=1 (otherwise, the default of &#39;&#39; is fine). # #     Options include: #       . Set $TEXT_ONLY, $REMOVE_COOKIES, $REMOVE_SCRIPTS, $FILTER_ADS, #           $HIDE_REFERER, and $INSERT_ENTRY_FORM as desired.  Set #           $REMOVE_SCRIPTS if anonymity is important. #       . To let the user choose all of those settings (except $TEXT_ONLY), #           set $ALLOW_USER_CONFIG=1. #       . To change the encoding format of the URL, modify the #           proxy_encode() and proxy_decode() routines.  The default #           routines are suitable for simple PATH_INFO compliance. #       . To encode cookies, modify the cookie_encode() and cookie_decode() #           routines. #       . You can restrict which servers this proxy will access, with #           @ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS. #       . Similarly, you can specify allowed and denied server lists for #           both cookies and scripts. #       . For security, you can ban access to private IP ranges, with #           @BANNED_NETWORKS. #       . If filtering ads, you can customize this with a few settings. #       . To insert your own block of HTML into each page, set $INSERT_HTML #           or $INSERT_FILE. #       . As a last resort, if you really can&#39;t run this script as NPH, #           you can try to run it as non-NPH by setting $NOT_RUNNING_AS_NPH=1. #           BUT, read the notes and warnings above that line.  Caveat surfor. #       . For crude load-balancing among a set of proxies, set @PROXY_GROUP. #       . Other config is possible; see the user configuration section. #       . If heavy use of this proxy puts a load on your server, see the #           &quot;NOTES ON PERFORMANCE&quot; section below. # #     For more info, read the comments regarding any config options you set. # #     This script MUST be installed as a non-parsed header (NPH) script. #       In Apache and many other servers, this is done by simply starting the #       filename with &quot;nph-&quot;.  It MAY be possible to fake it as a non-NPH #       script, MOST of the time, by using the $NOT_RUNNING_AS_NPH feature. #       This is not advised.  See the comments by that option for warnings. # # #   TO USE: #     Start a browsing session by calling the script with no parameters. #       You can bookmark pages you browse to through the proxy, or link to #       the URLs that are generated. # # #   NOTES ON PERFORMANCE: #     Unfortunately, this has gotten slower through the versions, mostly #       because of optional new features.  Configured equally, version 1.3 #       takes 25% longer to run than 1.0 or 1.1 (based on cough highly #       abbreviated testing).  Compiling takes about 50% longer. #     Leaving $REMOVE_SCRIPTS=1 adds 25-50% to the running time. #     Remember that we&#39;re talking about tenths of a second here.  Most of #       the delay experienced by the user is from waiting on two network #       connections.  These performance issues only matter if your server #       CPU is getting overloaded.  Also, these only matter when retrieving #       HTML, because it&#39;s the HTML modification that takes all the time. #     If you can, use mod_perl.  Starting with version 1.3.1, this should #       work under mod_perl, which requires Perl 5.004 or later.  If you use #       mod_perl, be careful to install this as an NPH script, i.e. set the #       &quot;PerlSendHeader Off&quot; configuration directive.  For more info, see the #       mod_perl documentation. #     If you use mod_perl and modify this script, see the note near the #       &quot;reset &#39;a-z&#39;&quot; line below, regarding UPPER_CASE and lower_case #       variables. # # #   TO DO: #     What I want to hear about: #       . Any HTML tags not being converted here. #       . Any method of introducing JavaScript or other script, that&#39;s not #           being filtered out here. #       . Any script MIME types other than those already in @SCRIPT_MIME_TYPES. #       . Any MIME types other than text/html that have links that need to #           be converted. # #     plug any other script holes (e.g. MSIE-proprietary, other MIME types?) #     This could use cleaner URL-encoding all over ($base_url, etc.) #     more error checking? #     find a simple encryption technique for proxy_encode() #     support more protocols, like mailto: or gopher: #     For ad filtering, add option to disable images from servers other than #       that of the containing HTML page?  Is it worth it? # # #   BUGS: #     Anonymity may not not perfect.  In particular, there may be some remaining #       JavaScript holes. #     URLs generated by JavaScript or similar mechanisms won&#39;t be re-proxy&#39;ed #       correctly.  JavaScript in general may not work as expected. #     Since ALL of your cookies are sent to this script (which then chooses #       the relevant ones), some cookies could conceivably be dropped if #       you accumulate a whole lot.  I haven&#39;t seen this happen yet. # # #   I first wrote this in 1996 as an experiment to allow indirect browsing. #     The original seed was a program I wrote for Rich Morin&#39;s article #     in the June 1996 issue of Unix Review, online at #     http://www.cfcl.com/tin/P/199606.shtml. # #   Confession: I didn&#39;t originally write this with the spec for HTTP #     proxies in mind, and there are probably some violations of the protocol #     (at least for proxies).  This whole thing is one big violation of the #     proxy model anyway, so I hereby rationalize that the spec can be widely #     interpreted here.  If there is demand, I can make it more conformant. #     The HTTP client and server components should be fine; it&#39;s just the #     special requirements for proxies that may not be followed. # #-------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p># Create your own proxy_encode() and proxy_decode() to tranform the target #   URL to and from the format that will be stored in PATH_INFO.  The encoded #   form should only contain characters that are legal in PATH_INFO.  This #   varies by server, but using only printable chars, no &quot;?&quot; or &quot;#&quot;, and no #   two adjacent slashes (&quot;//&quot;) works on most servers.  Don&#39;t let PATH_INFO #   contain the strings &quot;./&quot;, &quot;/.&quot;, &quot;../&quot;, or &quot;/..&quot;, or else it may get #   compressed like a pathname somewhere.  Try not to make the resulting #   string too long, either. # Of course, proxy_decode() must exactly undo whatever proxy_encode() does. # Make proxy_encode() as fast as possible-- it&#39;s a major bottleneck for the #   whole program. # Because of the simplified absolute URL resolution in full_url(), there may #   be &quot;..&quot; segments in the default encoding here, notably in the first path #   segment.  Normally, that&#39;s just an HTML mistake, but please tell me if #   you see any privacy exploit with it. # Note that a few sites have embedded applications (like applets or Shockwave) #   that expect to access URLs relative to the page&#39;s URL.  This means they #   may not work if the encoded target URL can&#39;t be treated like a base URL, #   e.g. that it can&#39;t be appended with something like &quot;../data/foo.data&quot; #   to get that expected data file.  In such cases, the default encoding below #   should let these sites work fine, as should any other encoding that can #   support URLs relative to it. </p>

<p># Use @ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS to restrict which servers a user #   can visit through this proxy.  Any URL at a host matching a pattern in #   @BANNED_SERVERS will be forbidden.  In addition, if @ALLOWED_SERVERS is #   not empty, then access is allowed only to servers that match a pattern #   in it.  In other words, @BANNED_SERVERS means &quot;ban these servers&quot;, and #   @ALLOWED_SERVERS (if not empty) means &quot;allow only these servers&quot;.  If a #   server matches both lists, it is banned. # These are each a list of Perl 5 regular expressions (aka patterns or #   regexes), not literal host names.  To turn a hostname into a pattern, #   replace every &quot;.&quot; with &quot;\.&quot;, add &quot;^&quot; to the beginning, and add &quot;$&quot; to the #   end.  For example, &quot;www.example.com&quot; becomes &quot;^www\.example\.com$&quot;.  To #   match every host ending in something, leave out the &quot;^&quot;.  For example, #   &quot;\.example\.com$&quot; matches every host ending in &quot;.example.com&quot;.  For more #   details about Perl regular expressions, see the Perl documentation.

<p># If @BANNED_NETWORKS is set, then forbid access to these hosts or networks. # This is done by IP address, not name, so it provides more certain security #   than @BANNED_SERVERS above. # Specify each element as a decimal IP address-- all four integers for a host, #   or one to three integers for a network.  For example, &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; bans #   access to the local host, and &#39;192.168&#39; bans access to all IP addresses #   in the 192.168 network.  Sorry, no banning yet for subnets other than #   8, 16, or 24 bits. # IF YOU&#39;RE RUNNING THIS ON OR INSIDE A FIREWALL, THIS SETTING IS STRONGLY #   RECOMMENDED!!  In particular, you should ban access to other machines #   inside the firewall that the firewall machine itself may have access to. #   Otherwise, external users will be able to access any internal hosts that #   the firewall can access.  Even if that&#39;s what you intend, you should ban #   access to any hosts that you don&#39;t explicitly want to expose to outside #   users. # In addition to the recommended defaults below, add all IP addresses of your #   server machine if you want to protect it like this. # After you set this, YOU SHOULD TEST to verify that the proxy can&#39;t access #   the IP addresses you&#39;re banning! # This feature is simple now but will be more complete in future releases. #   How would you like this to be extended?

 summary : <p>Sony® Reader provides a new way to experience reading.  </p>

<p>More details on the reader device from sony website: &#39;The Sony® Reader’s display uses e Ink® - a significant improvement over CRT and LCD technology. Instead of rows of glowing cells, e Ink® microcapsules actually appear as either black or white depending on a positive or negative charge determined by the content. The result is a reading experience that’s similar to paper - high contrast, high resolution, viewable in direct sunlight and at a nearly 180-degree angle, and requiring no power to maintain the image. In other words, it&#39;s a screen that, like you, is well read.&#39; </p>

<p>Unfortunately no support is provided for the device on Linux and Mac OS X. This library is an effort to provide FUSE-based filesystem which can mount prs500&#39;s on Linux, MacOS and, possibly, other OSes using Kovid Goyal&#39;s libprs500 as a starting point. </p>

<p>The device supports PDF, RTF, TXT and proprietary Sony® Ebook Format (BBeB). </p>

<p>Currently the project is ON HOLD. There is some libusb code in there that might be useful, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not deleting it for now.</p>

 title : The pspstacklesspython Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the port of Python programming language to the Sony PSP console.The current version is 2.5.2 which is the latest ported release from CPython and Stackless Python. </p>

<p>From the Stackless main page: </p>

<p>Stackless Python is an enhanced version of the Python programming language. It allows programmers to reap the benefits of thread-based programming without the performance and complexity problems associated with conventional threads. The microthreads that Stackless adds to Python are a cheap and lightweight convenience which can if used properly, give the following benefits: </p>

<p>Improved program structure. More readable code. Increased programmer productivity. Check the BasicInstallandUsage wiki page for installation and usage instructions. </p>

<p>For more information on module usage, check PSPPythonModules and MusicSupport Wiki pages. </p>

<p>For Python and Stackless Python help follow the links section on the right. </p>

<p>After installing, take a look in the small GameDemo created using features from Stackless and PSP modules. This demo can be seen in this video provided by a user. </p>

<p>All releases follow the same naming scheme, for example:  StacklessPSP2.5.2_R1.zip you find the name - StacklessPSP, 2.5.2 which is the Python release and a underline followed by a number which is the StacklessPSP release version. When multiple releases from the same Python version are made, the number after the underline will change. </p>

 summary : <p>A project based on wanting a web framework built for speed and integration with standards. Currently modeling Rails in the area of application design, but improving areas with modules that are optimized for speed because I sit there and benchmark every line until I can do it no more. </p>

<p>Model uses Rose::DB::Object for ORM support, but it hase been designed for you to use anything that you want -- just my recommendation. It will handle to the association with the database that is well designed -- meaning the database handles the relationships not the ORM. </p>

<p>View uses a custom built XML::Builder and EPB that will handle templating that make incorporating Perl code into document easily. There is no language better than the langauge the application is built to use for the View. I am basing off the fact that out of my personal experience I have never met a &#39;designer&#39; that just use a simple templating language. The view module is easily extendible to support any template you want, just requires that it knows how to render it correctly. Right now each view is loaded as a moudle with a render method. </p>

<p>Controller is designed to allow pre/post operations of a method call, plus rendering of different views. Trying to determine what takes precedence as phtml, pxml, text, etc. </p>

<p>Just recently I have submitted an actual working example of a project can be setup. Its very small and crude, but it will actually work in a browser and render the templates of a controllers action (YAY!!!).</p>

 title : The pure-lang Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation, lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code. Pure also integrates nicely with a number of other computing environments, most notably Faust, PureData, Octave, Reduce and TeXmacs. A fairly extensive collection of addon modules is available, which makes Pure usable as a compiled scripting language for a variety of purposes.</p>

 title : The puz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Across Lite is crossword software used by sites like the New York Times for distributing crosswords. </p>

<p>File FormatThe file format is not documented anywhere, which meant third-party software could neither read nor produce Across Lite files.  So the primary output of this project is the file format documentation. </p>

<p>Some implementations that consume or produce these files: </p>

<p>libpuz (C, GPL): see below rubypuz (Ruby, MIT): http://neugierig.org/software/ruby/rubypuz/ puzhs (Haskell bindings for libpuz, GPL and MIT): http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpuz </p>

<p>libpuzlibpuz is a C library for reading and writing Across Lite&#39;s .puz files.  The library is relatively stable and in current use.  The latest version is available from this project page - see the downloads section for a tarball.  Older versions are available at: http://www.joshisanerd.com/puz/.  Haskell bindings for the library are available from a different page, see above. </p>

<p>DHTML CrosswordsWe&#39;ve also built a rudimentary web-based multiplayer server for solving crosswords with your friends.  Have you ever worked on a crossword in the same newspaper, sharing a pen?  It&#39;s sorta like that except everyone can type at the same time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not nearly complete but it is playable and can be pulled from the subversion repository.</p>

 summary : <p>The py-jasmine project will help journal editors to produce pdf file and publish it easily. The ultimate goal of this project is to help people setup a new form of collaboration to generate high quality content. </p>

<p>We just began the project, and are seeking your helps! </p>

<p>BackgroundThe background of this project is that an emerging form of online collaboration is becoming popular in China in 2007. </p>

<p>All readers must join an online group to receive new issues by email. Contributors have an online groups to discuss internal affairs. An email address is setuped for contributors to send articles to editors. The editors filter the articles and organize them into an issue in pdf format. The editors send a new issue to the readers&#39; group.  These kinds of collaboration is highly dependent on the email and group service. Although it is closed to the mass to some extend, we still think it will be useful for some part of the users. For these kinds of collaboration, the most burdensome work is the editor&#39;s work. So we want to make a tool to help the editors. </p>

<p>Examples are Far And Wide Journal, Chinese Independent Reading Report and others. </p>

<p>AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with optimal or near-optimal efficiency.  Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix.  This feature is especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes and irregular grids. </p>

<p>Aug 25, 2007Version 0.11 released. This is a bugfix release only, affecting only MS Windows see the CHANGELOG for more details. </p>

<p>Aug 15, 2007Version 0.10 released. Big news this time is that I&#39;ve added support for the Widcomm stack in Windows XP. This is not well tested and very experimental at this point, so bug reports are appreciated. From the CHANGELOG: </p>

<p>    added experimental Broadcom/Widcomm support.  All the basics should be
<br/>    supported:
<br/>        RFCOMM sockets
<br/>        L2CAP sockets
<br/>        Device Discovery, Name Lookup
<br/>        SDP search on remote devices
<br/>        SDP advertisement (RFCOMM, L2CAP)</p>

<p>    Widcomm stack notes:
<br/>        1. BluetoothSocket.accept () always returns 0 for the port,
<br/>           as the RFCOMM channel/L2CAP PSM of the client device is not exposed
<br/>           by the Widcomm API
<br/>        2. Not all fields of advertise_service are supported.  The following
<br/>           parameters are currently not supported:
<br/>               description, protocols
<br/>        3. The following methods of BluetoothSocket are not supported:
<br/>              gettimeout, dup, makefile, settimeout
<br/>        4. The following parameters to discover_devices are not supported:
<br/>               duration, flush_cache (cache always flushes)
<br/>        5. The timeout parameter of lookup_name is not supported
<br/>        6. Once a listening socket has accepted a connection, it is not put
<br/>           back into listening mode.  The original listening socket essentially
<br/>           becomes useless.
<br/>        7. SDP search/browse operations on the local host are not yet supportedDec 27, 2006Version 0.9.2 released. Fixed an endian-error that affects L2CAP sockets on big-endian machines only. </p>

<p>Sep 14, 2006Version 0.9.1 released. Fixed a missing #include that prevented PyBluez from compiling with new versions of BlueZ </p>

<p>Sep 1, 2006Version 0.9 released. Bug fixes and minor functionality improvements. See the CHANGELOG for details. </p>

<p>July 31, 2006Version 0.8 released. Bug fix for Linux and minor functionality improvements for Windows XP. See the CHANGELOG for details. </p>

 summary : <p>基于python的中文分词项目。 </p>

<p>第一个版本实现了基于的MMSEG中文分词算法Python实现。MMSEG实际上是一个正向最大匹配+多个规则的分词算法。链接给出的几个网站写的很清楚了。在开发过程中我增加了一个规则来处理原来的算法中有可能出现的冲突问题。当所有的规则都无法唯一的确定一个chunk时，优先选择后面比较长的词。开发过程中参照了MMSEG的Java实现和ruby实现。并且对性能进行了初步的优化。 </p>

<p>目前的性能数据：在Pentium D 2.8G的CPU下处理2.9MB的文本数据，全切分的复杂算法不开启pysco的情况下104s，开启pysco的情况下90s，能达到32KB/s。简单算法可以达到64KB/s。经测试速度能达到Java版本MMSEG的1/3，未来如果要进一步优化速度的话应该是把关键的算法的实现移植到c语言中。 </p>

<p>实现了简单的余弦相似度计算的算法。 </p>

<p>TODO: </p>

<p>实现NLTK兼容的接口。(目前已经增加了tokenizer接口) C语言级别的优化 （测试中，增加了is_basic_latin的c实现，考虑字典用c语言优化） 实现其他算法，目前考虑一个ICTCLAS的python实现，要看有没有时间。 支持停用词，支持unicode的字母数字检测等。 与分词有关的其他想法 </p>

<p>研究一下ferret/cferret，能否实现一个python binding并且结合进去。（研究发现ferret的实现非常复杂，ruby绑定的接口部分的c代码都有上万行，放弃了，还是用solr吧） 与nlp/datamining的进一步结合</p>

<p>PyeTV also integrates with ETVComskip, a Mac OS X port of comskip (http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/) designed to work with EyeTV.  ETVComskip allows users of EyeTV to enjoy commercial-free recorded television.  PyeTV provides capabilities of turning commercial skipping on and off from within Front Row, as well as starting a commercial search for recordings which do not have commercial markers already. You will have to install ETVComskip separately if you want this functionality. </p>

<p>InstallationDownload the .dmg file.  Double click to open the .dmg file and run the installer application.  The installer will prompt for an administrator&#39;s password (because it needs to be installed in /Library).  Further, if you do not have &quot;Enable access for assistive devices&quot; turned on in the Universal access preference pane, the installer will attempt to do that for you after another password prompt. </p>

<p>A few users have reported problems with the .dmg file. In this case, make sure that the extension on the file is .dmg and try again to open it.  This should resolve the problem. </p>

<p>Special Note for Snow Leopard and EyeTV 3.2.1The 10.6.2 update to Snow Leopard broke the usage of the Apple remote to control EyeTV. Until there is an update to EyeTV, the default remote driver will not work.  The work around I&#39;ve found us to install the Candleair driver from: http://www.iospirit.com/labs/candelair/, and enable Leopard combatibility mode in the corresponding preference pane. </p>

<p>NewsNov 28, 2009Version 2.0 released, with Snow Leopard support. </p>

<p>This version also includes support for the favorite channels playlist. </p>

<p>Oct 24, 2008Version 1.2 released!  Changes include </p>

<p>The channels list now has program info as metadata, if it&#39;s available from EyeTV.   Cleaner interaction with EyeTV.  We no longer return to PyeTV on &quot;pause&quot; but only on &quot;menu&quot; which makes it possible to pause live tv, etc.   Problems switching back and forth between watching live tv and recorded programs are resolved. EyeTV windows closed when Front Row exits Improved Program guide access. Can now handle non-ascii characters in recording titles. See Version_1_2_Changelog for details. </p>

<p>Apr 16, 2008Version 1.1 released.  This version features image previews of the recordings, and has a very similar look to browsing the music library in Front Row.  The recordings list is cleaned up slightly, sorted by date, and the recordings are shown in a slightly smaller font to allow for longer episode titles to be seen without scrolling.</p>

 summary : <p>PyFFmpeg is a wrapper around FFmpeg&#39;s libavcodec, libavformat and libavutil libraries whose main purpose is to provide access to individual frames of video files of various formats (including MPEG and DIVX encoded videos), and, also in latest beta,to audio data. </p>

<p>Download PyFFmpeg </p>

<p>FFmpeghttp://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/ is a software package containing libraries and utilities for encoding, decoding and converting audio and video files. It includes libavcodec, a leading audio/video codec library that can work with most video and audio formats. This library generally uses its own codec. And thus it does not depend on your operating system installed libraries. </p>

<p>Using FFmpeg and libavcodec you can develop applications that can parse and display video files and be sure they will work on most platform, including of course Linux, Macintosh and Windows boxes. </p>

<p>PyFFmpegThe libavcodec and libavformat libraries of the FFmpeg project are quite complex to use, especially from Python.  </p>

<p>PyFFmpeg provides a simple object oriented interface to those libraries. </p>

<p>PyFFmpeg-1 : Original releasePyFFmpeg has stayed in minimal status where it could be used to extract individual frames from video files and create PIL image objects from them.  </p>

<p>While there were several Python libraries that offer to play video files most  of them did not provide any API to extract individual frames, and this is the  reason PyFFmpeg was created. </p>

<p>A more complex wrapper around FFMPEG has been implemented within PyMedia.  However, PyMEDIA is now based on and old version of ffmpeg, and probably also need some minor rewrites. </p>

<p>ExampleHere&#39;s a simple example that extracts the first frame from a video file and saves it in .png format. You&#39;ll need PIL to run it. </p>

<p>import pyffmpeg</p>

<p>stream = pyffmpeg.VideoStream()
<br/>stream.open(&#39;myvideo.avi&#39;)
<br/>image = stream.GetFrameNo(0)
<br/>image.save(&#39;firstframe.png&#39;)PyFFmpeg : Upcoming betaWe have recenlty performed a complete rewrite of PyFFMPEG. </p>

<p>It is now available from the normal SVN download in the standard directory  for testing purposes, and also as a source package in the download section. </p>

<p>The new PyFFMPEG is bound to NumPy rather than to Python Imaging Library (PIL),  it supports video and audio decoding. (But still not encoding or streaming/thought we are thinking about it) </p>

<p>Usage ExamplesThe previous example shall still work ( at least on the files where it used to work ). </p>

<p>Here examples of new usage : </p>

<p>import pyffmpeg</p>

<p>## create the reader object
<br/>mp=FFMpegReader()</p>

<p>## open an audio-video file
<br/>mp.open(&quot;your file.mpg&quot;)
<br/>tracks=mp.get_tracks()</p>

<p>## define a function to be called back each time a frame is read...
<br/>def obs(f):
<br/>  display(f[2]) # you have to write your display function</p>

<p>tracks[0].set_observer(obs)</p>

<p>mp.run()Many working examples can be found in the example directory </p>

<p>For those that prefer PILSome users that  were using pyffmpeg for non scientific purpose to prefer PIL. Hence, A support for PIL will still be maintained but functionalities will be limitated (No audiosupport / Only RGB pixels) </p>

<p>Currently, numpy is still required for compiling in all the cases.</p>

<p>2. A complicated version of pyipopt that using numpy data types from users who wants to do high performance computation.  </p>

<p>3. With the help of nlpy, now you can directly manipulate AMPL nl file in python directly and send it to ipopt with one or two lines of code.  </p>

<p>4. A connector to openopt (DONE by openopt community now) </p>

<p>5. Pyipopt support multiple instances of problems. Aka, you can use one module and solve multiple problem instances.  </p>

<p>Pyipopt is reasonably robust according to my own test.  </p>

 summary : <p>PyMCBayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However, few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are non-trivial to code by hand. PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>DownloadSource code and binary packages for the 2.0 release are now available at the Python Package Index. If a binary package is not available for your platform, building PyMC should pose no particular problem, requiring only a C and Fortran compiler. Build instructions can be found in the user guide included in the source distribution. </p>

<p>Previous users of the 1.3 version should note that the syntax used to define statistical models has changed significantly. While it is always difficult to break backward-compatibility, the changes bring drastic improvements in performance and flexibility.  </p>

<p>ExamplesTo get an idea of what a PyMC2 model looks like, we have provided a few examples: </p>

<p>Simple occupancy model using latent states Waterfowl band recovery model Simple pricing model Hierarchical Poisson failure rates Fisheries surplus production model (updated Aug. 2009) Salamander occupancy estimation model Simple probit regression model </p>

<p>For users familiar with BUGS, here are a few examples that are translated directly from BUGS models; the original code is included in each file as a docstring: </p>

<p>Koala sighting model (from Link &amp; Barker 2009) Conditional multinomial mark-recapture model (from Link &amp; Barker 2009) Unconditional multinomial mark-recapture model (apparently not possible in BUGS) </p>

<p>User-contributed tutorials and recipes can be found in in the wiki. More examples can be found in the examples folder in the source tree. </p>

<p>Also, the user guide contains a tutorial section. </p>

<p>SupportThe PyMC User’s Guide contains detailed installation instructions, as well as some MCMC theoretical background and a tutorial on using PyMC. The user&#39;s guide is available in the downloads section. </p>

<p>If you wish to file a bug report or suggest enhancements to PyMC, please submit an issue at our issues page. </p>

<p>Note: A large number of bugs and issues have been fixed since PyMC 2.0 was released. We therefore recommend that serious users build a version for themselves using the current development code, rather than run the released version.</p>

 title : The pymel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Python in Maya Done RightPyMEL makes python scripting with Maya work the way it should. Maya&#39;s command module is a direct translation of mel commands into python commands. The result is a very awkward and unpythonic syntax which does not take advantage of python&#39;s strengths -- particulary, a flexible, object-oriented design. PyMEL builds on the cmds module by organizing many of its commands into a class hierarchy, and by customizing them to operate in a more succinct and intuitive way. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Project GoalsCreate an open-source python module for Maya that is intuitive to MEL users and python users alike Fix bugs and design limitations in Maya&#39;s python modues, maya.cmds and maya.mel Keep code concise and readable Add organization through class hierarchy and sub-modules Provide documentation accessible via html and the builtin help() function Make it &quot;just work&quot; Production ProvenSince its release over a year ago PyMEL, has accumulated an impressive resume in both feature films and games: </p>

<p>DreamWorks: Fung Fu Panda, Shrek 4, Monsters Vs Aliens, and How to Train Your Dragon Luma Pictures: Pirates of the Carribean: At World&#39;s End, Harry Potter 6, and Wolverine ImageMovers Digital: Robert Zemeckis&#39; upcoming A Christman Carol Here&#39;s what Seth Gibson of Bungie Studios, makers of the hit game Halo, has to say: </p>

<p>&quot;Having done production python code myself for many years, wrapping my head around Maya&#39;s native implementation took a little bit of time. With PyMel, I can think and write the python code and syntax I&#39;m already used to, which speeds up my development time considerably. It&#39;s also going to help our other Technical Artists with their Python learning curve, since PyMEL&#39;s syntax is consistent with most other python packages. Kudos to the PyMel team for such a well thought out project!&quot; </p>

<p>What&#39;s NewAPI HybridizationPyMEL 0.9 is a dramatic leap forward in the evolution of python in Maya. The node and attribute classes have been rewritten from the ground up to use the python API as their foundation, increasing the speed and fidelity of PyMEL&#39;s object-oriented design. </p>

<p>PyMEL harnesses the API to create a name-independent representation of your object. This means that the annoying inconsistencies of string comparisons are over: no more worrying about short names versus long names, DAG paths, unique paths, instance paths... it&#39;s all handled intelligently for you. And what&#39;s more, if anything causes the name of yourobject to change it will automatically be reflected in your python object. </p>

<p>PyMEL node classes now include hundreds of new methods derived from the API, but with the same intuitive and unified design as before. With PyMEL you get the benefits of API speed and versatility without the advanced learning curve. </p>

<p>BSD LicensePyMEL is released under the BSD license, which is as open as open source gets. Your studio can freely use, contribute to, and modify this module with no strings attached. </p>

<p>Improved Standalone SupportUnlike the maya module, PyMEL behaves the same in a standalone interpreter as it does in an GUI session. When pymel detects that it is being imported in a standalone interpreter it performs these operations: </p>

<p>initializes maya.standalone parses your Maya.env and adds variables to your environment sources Autodesk&#39;s initialization MEL scripts sources user preferences sources userSetup.mel This makes using Maya in a standalone environment the ideal environment for for batch processes and even rendering. </p>

<p>Tighter MEL IntegrationCalling MEL from python is still an unfortunate necessity, so PyMEL makes it as easy as possible. This release builds on PyMEL&#39;s already vastly improved method, which allows you to call a mel procedure as if it was a python function: </p>

<p>values = [&#39;one&#39;, &#39;two&#39;, &#39;three&#39;, &#39;four&#39;]</p>

<p># default
<br/>maya.mel.eval( &#39;stringArrayRemoveDuplicates( {&quot;&#39;+&#39;&quot;,&quot;&#39;.join(values)+&#39;&quot;})&#39;)</p>

<p># PyMEL
<br/>mel.stringArrayRemoveDuplicates( values )
<br/>In the new release, when a MEL script called from PyMEL raises an error, you will get the specific MEL error message in the python traceback, along with line numbers!For example, here&#39;s a procedure &quot;myScript&quot; with a line that will result in an error: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; mel.eval( &#39;&#39;&#39;global proc myScript( string $stringArg, float $floatArray[] ){
<br/>...     float $donuts = `ls -type camera`;}&#39;&#39;&#39;)When we call the procedure via PyMEL, we can quickly determine the problem, because PyMEL gives us the error and the line number: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; mel.myScript( &#39;foo&#39;, [] )
<br/>Traceback (most recent call last):
<br/>    ...
<br/>MelConversionError: Error occurred during execution of MEL script: line 2: Cannot convert data of type string[] to type float.Also, getting and setting MEL global variables is accomplished via a special dictionary-like object, which keeps it simple and intuitive: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; melGlobals[&#39;$gMainFileMenu&#39;]
<br/>mainFileMenu
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; melGlobals[&#39;$gGridDisplayGridLinesDefault&#39;] = 2Who is PyMEL for?For the NoviceObject-oriented programming, like that provided by PyMEL, is more intuitive to learn because the functionality of an object is directly associated with the object itself. For an artist starting to program in Maya, the first question you might ask is &quot;what can I do with this node?&quot; Using a procedural approach, like that offered by MEL or maya.cmds, you&#39;ll have to dig through the hundreds of MEL commands looking for the one that you want. For a camera node, the camera MEL command is easy to find, but did you find orbit, track, dolly, and tumble, which also work on cameras? In PyMEL, all you have to do is type help(Camera) in the python script editor to find out all the things a camera node can do, or just look up the Camera class in the PyMEL docs. </p>

<p>For the MEL ScripterWhen we say PyMEL is concise and easy to read, we mean it. </p>

<p>MELstring $sel[] = `ls -sl`;
<br/>string $shapes[] = `listRelatives -s $sel[0]`;

<p>For those who are already masters of python and who naturally expect more out of a python package, PyMEL is for you, too. It was written in for use in production by experiened programmers with a vision for how to add object-oriented design to Maya. </p>

 title : The pynext Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryA python web programming library based around modern trends in web-development like WSGI, XML, XML databases, automatic form generation, advanced authentication schemes and much more. </p>

<p>Status of the projectPlanning. </p>

<p>DetailsPyNext is in many ways a natural evolution of Enkel. It has many of the same goals and as such might be considered as Enkel 2.0. The sections below explains the most important ideas/goals of PyNext. </p>

<p>Tight XML intergrationWe are planning XML Scheme, XPath, RelaxNG, DOM3, SAX and XQuery implementations. This will enable us to: </p>

<p>Create an XML database (in C++ with a python api). Implement a good xml-based config file system which autovalidates. Implement XML based models which can be used to validate data from web-forms (WAP, XHTML1, XForms..) and to autogenerate forms. Implement the XML TopicMap standard. </p>

<p>We are currently considering using these libraries to achieve this: </p>

<p>Apache Xerces XQilla Boost.Python lxml </p>

<p>WSGI utilities and serverEnkel already has much of this: </p>

<p>WSGI server for HTTP, SCGI and CGI. WSGI application runner which can be used in automatic tests (unit and doc tests). Utility functions for working with WSGI environment dicts. but a review and cleanup is required. </p>

<p>InternationalizationThis should probably be improved a bit from the implementation in Enkel. </p>

<p>Filesystem abstraction layerA filesystem abstraction layer similar to gnome VFS. </p>

<p>Strong automatic testing supportWe are working on a JUnit-4, testNG and unittest inspired test framework. Planned features: </p>

<p>Automatic testing of programs using posix threads and stackless threads. Tests will be able to depend on other tests. A test runner application will be included. Something like &quot;python -m pynext.test.runner myproject.MyTest&quot;. Compatibility layer for unittest. A test will be able to belong to one or more groups. Groups can be excluded/included by the test runner. </p>

<p>MailWe wish to have strong mail support. Our first goal is an object-oriented and easy to use imap library.</p>

 summary : <p>Aboutpysage is a lightweight high-level message passing library supporting actor based concurrency.   </p>

<p>It also extends the &quot;actor model&quot; to support actor partitioning/grouping to further scalability.  pysage has a simple high-level interface.  Messages are serialized and sent lightweight using pipes or domain sockets across local &quot;groups&quot;.  In the case of network messages, UDP is used. </p>

<p>simple pythonic API efficient message propagation within group, across group, across network network messages can optionally be configured to be reliable and/or ordered using UDP grouping - actors can be partitioned into groups that are run in separate os processes process-local singleton manager - actor registration, discovery, message propagation publisher/subscriber pattern built-in </p>

<p>pysage strives to stay thin and lightweight. </p>

<p>Installationpysage can be installed via setuptools: </p>

<p>easy_install pysageUsageHere, we have a simple actor that receives a &quot;take damage&quot; message in a 30 ticks/sec game loop. </p>

<p>import time
<br/>from pysage import Actor, ActorManager, Message</p>

<p>mgr = ActorManager.get_singleton()</p>

<p>class BombMessage(Message):
<br/>    properties = [&#39;damage&#39;]
<br/>    packet_type = 101</p>

<p>class Player(Actor):
<br/>    subscriptions = [&#39;BombMessage&#39;]
<br/>    def handle_BombMessage(self, msg):
<br/>        print &#39;I took %s damage from the bomb&#39; % msg.get_property(&#39;damage&#39;)</p>

<p>mgr.register_actor(Player(), &#39;player1&#39;)
<br/>mgr.queue_message(BombMessage(damage=10))</p>

<p>while True:
<br/>    processed = mgr.tick()
<br/>    time.sleep(.03)pysage allows you to use this same simple API, for messaging across processes and networks.   </p>

<p>pysage does not confine you to the constraints of the &quot;actor model&quot;.  For example, the &quot;grouping&quot; concept allows many actors to reside in the same process.  This allows you to avoid spawning too many os processes and reduce IPC overhead.   </p>

<p>Further, actors in the same group are local to each other, so they can have access to each other.  It&#39;s kind of like a: &quot;what happens in the group, stays in the group&quot; concept.  Although, using messages are encouraged instead of straight calls for most situations, even in the same pysage group. </p>

<p>Look at Documentation for more. </p>

<p>Statusstable release 1.5.2 </p>

<p>May 11th, 2009 - this includes the latest grouping with processes and networking functionality. </p>

<p>Licensepysage itself uses MIT license.   </p>

<p>However, if you need messaging across network, pysage uses pyraknet and therefore Raknet for UDP network implementation.  pyraknet uses the GNU Lesser General Public License. </p>

 summary : <p>PyScripter is a free and open-source Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created with the ambition to become competitive in functionality with commercial Windows-based IDEs available for other languages. Being built in a compiled language is rather snappier than some of the other Python IDEs and provides an extensive blend of features that make it a productive Python development environment. </p>

<p>Support: Get support on PyScripter by emailing to pyscripter@gmail.com or by visiting the PyScripter Internet group and posting your questions and comments. </p>

<p>Notes:  </p>

<p>For compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, since version 1.9.9.5, PyScripter requires the latest C++ Redistributable Package. This is automatically installed by Python 2.6 and Python 3.x. If you do not have any of these versions installed, then you need to download and install it manually.  If you are using a 64bit version of Windows note that PyScripter will only work if a 32bit version of Python is installed. It is recommended that you use the remote interpreter and debugger. To do that you need to download and install the Python package Rpyc version 2.6 available for download in the project downloads. </p>

 title : The pyshards Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Pyshards is a python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit.  Horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.  When the partitions exist as independent databases and when they exist within a shared-nothing architecture they are known as shards. (Google apparently coined the term shard for such database partitions, and we&#39;ve adopted it here.) The goal is to provide big opportunities for database scalability while maintaining good performance. Sharded datasets can be queried individually (one shard) or collectively (aggregate of all shards). Pyshards uses a hash/modulo based algorithm to distribute data.   </p>

<p>One of the goals for this project was to provide a way to reasonably add polynomial capacity (number of original shards squared) without requiring re-balancing (re-sharding).   Another goal for the project was to provide a web-based shard monitoring tool, one that would allows admins to keep an eye on resource capacity. </p>

<p>Pyshards is no longer under development, but many of its core functions are implemented and are stable. There are a number of other projects that provide similar functionality, but their goals and/or implementations are quite different. Here are a few: </p>

 title : The pysv Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>pysv is intended to make working with subversion a little easier, especially for folks who use branches. It wraps the svn command and figures out some of the fiddlier arguments for you. </p>

<p>It expects the repository layout to look like this: </p>

<p>.../myproject/trunk/
<br/>              branches/
<br/>              tags/The commands also expect to be run inside a checked out copy of the source. </p>

<p>The idea is to encourage good branching practice by making it very easy to do. </p>

<p>An example workflow: </p>

<p>svn co http://mysvn/projects/myproject/trunk myproject cd myproject Make some changes Realise that you should be on a branch pysv.py branch mybranch pysv.py switch mybranch work and svn commit pysv.py merge trunk pysv.py switch trunk pysv.py merge mybranch Resolve conflicts. pysv.py mergelog mybranch svn commit pysv.py rmbranch mybranch</p>

Cobra is such a project that visualize the vm. In Cobra, you can see how many bytecodes will be executed by the vm for a Python statement, you can see how a bytecode affecting the namespace and vm&#39;s stack.Understanding the mechanism of the vm will improve your understanding of Python. </p>

<p>The Cobra is made up by three main componenets: VM Server, Web Server and Web Client. I use Django to build web server. And in the web client, I use Ajax to communicate with web server. The web server will connect to the vm server to get information after it received the command from web client. The vm server is modified from Python itself. So here is the simplest architecture. </p>

 title : The python-elements Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is Elements</p>

<p>NOTE: Elements v2 is now being developed in SVN trunk, and the documentation will soon change. Elements will also change license from Apache to New BSD. The older version will however still use Apache.  </p>

<p>Elements is a Python library that provides simple parsing from XML to Python objects and back. It uses the well known ElementTree API to parse XML into Python objects. ElementTrees are very nice for parsing XML, but sometimes you want something even closer to Python. You want the XML to &quot;magically&quot; fill out your Python objects, and be able to access your values using dotted notation. This is what Elements does for you. Elements is similar to lxml.objectify and Amara2 Bindery. </p>

<p>However, Elements does not work well for all kinds of XML documents. It&#39;s a compromise. It&#39;s very good for parsing XML over HTTP based protocols such as Atom, but may not work well for you when the ordering of the elements is significant such as for XHTML or Apple Property Lists (PList). At first you might get the feeling of over-engineering when looking at Elements, but once your classes are defined, you will feel and enjoy the power of the this library.  </p>

<p>HistoryMost of the idea, design and code has been taken from the CouchDB Python Library. They have made a fantastic implementation of their Schema/Mapping which is a higher-level API for mapping between CouchDB documents and Python objects. With Elements v2 we are using the same design to parse and generate XML documents. </p>

<p>Elements v1 was based on the Atom parser of the gdata-python-client library. I really liked the idea and wanted to make it easy to use with other applications and for other XML formats as well. Elements v1 works well but the class declarations are quite verbose.  </p>

<p>SourceTo browse the Elements library source code, visit the Source tab. </p>

<p>ExampleA simple example. Lets say you want to parse the following XML document: </p>

<p>    Dag Brattli
<br/>    39
<br/>    
<br/>With Elements you have to declare a Python class for storing the information you are interested in. Unspecified elements and attributes will be ignored by the parser. </p>

<p>from elements import Element</p>

<p>class Example(Element):
<br/>    _tag = &#39;Example&#39;</p>

<p>    version = TextAttribute()</p>

<p>    hacker = BoolElement(tag=&quot;Hacker&quot;)
<br/>    name = TextElement(name=&quot;Name&quot;)
<br/>    age = IntegerElement(name=&quot;Age&quot;))    Now you are ready for some action: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = Example.from_string(example) # The XML doc above
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print e.name
<br/>Dag Brattli
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print e.age
<br/>39
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print e.hacker

 title : The python-money Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>python-money provides carefully designed basic Python primitives for working with money and currencies.   </p>

<p>The primary objectives of this module is to aid in the development of financial applications by increasing testability and reusability, reducing code duplication and reducing the risk of defects occurring in the code.   </p>

<p>The module defines two basic Python classes -- a Currency class and a Money class.  It also pre-defines all the world&#39;s currencies, according to the ISO 4217 standard.  The classes define some basic operations for working with money, overriding Python&#39;s addition, substraction, multiplication, etc. in order to account for working with money in different currencies.  They also define currency-aware comparison operators.  To avoid floating point precision errors in monetary calculations, the module uses Python&#39;s Decimal type exclusively.  </p>

<p>The design of the module is based on the Money enterprise design pattern, as described in Martin Fowler&#39;s &quot;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&quot;.   </p>

<p>This project also contains Django helper classes for easy integration with python-money.   </p>

 title : The python-on-windows-docs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>While Python&#39;s own documentation set is well-maintained and meets most people&#39;s needs, people coming to Python on Windows suffer from a couple of drawbacks. One is that, historically, Python comes from a Unix background and some of its functionality reflects that. Even when low-level functions are available on Windows, they often refer to a Posix-compliant layer which Microsoft seems to have abandoned long ago. Another is that, while the pywin32 extensions are wide-ranging and actively maintained, their documentation tends towards the sparse and functional. </p>

<p>This project is a Sphinx-based documentation project which aims to provide example-based documentation for Windows developers looking to use Python for Windows-specific tasks. </p>

 title : The python-pages Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Python pages is a framework that makes it easier to develop web applications in Python. What is actually does is: </p>

<p>Provide an easy way to embed Python code into HTML, similar to PHP, JSP and other server side languages. Cross platform: runs on Mac, Windows and Linux Aims to be as declarative as possible. But the Python language is always available to do the same. Standards compliant: XHTML strict output (forced through the framework) Correct use of HTTP status codes Unicode support Make reusing HTML very easy. It uses concepts like master pages and inclusion of other pages as a web control. This is a very rich template mechanism. when pages act like web controls for other pages, they are simply available as a member variable of the other pages. It contains a built-in HTTP/1.1 web server but supports CGI. Uses clean URLs. There are no .page extensions, and suffixes are available as a variable. For instance, if there&#39;s a page /test.page, then the URL /test/abc will render /test.page, but pass the suffix /abc. This is totally not a new concept, but just very easy to use. Output filters for post processing of the generated XHTML tree. URLs will always be relative to the page where they&#39;ve been generated. This makes it very easy for included pages to use URLs relative to their own even if they are in a totally different directory. (This mechanism requires an output filter.) The framework does not yet run in IronPython, but the IPy team will hopefully fix it soon. </p>

<p>When Python 3000 will be released, this framework will also be ported to Python 3000, and we&#39;ll stop supporting earlier versions as well. </p>

<p>The core (or render engine) is stable and working very well. However, there are still a few other parts of the framework that can be improved. (like the documentation) </p>

<p>Interested in contributing to the framework? Please contact me. We certainly can use some additional developers. </p>

<p>In the futureSome things we are working on: </p>

<p>The render engine has built-in debug functionality. The current web based debugger isn&#39;t yet ready to use, but most of the back-end is already implemented. It should be possible to add or remove breakpoints while debugging and viewing the locals/globals. We will keep adding more web controls (like a forum, guestbook, ...) FastCGI support ExamplesNOTE: this examples are outdated and cannot be used anymore in this way. I have to rewrite them, but still, you get an idea of some possibilities. </p>

 title : The python-pipelines Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Python Pipelines lets you solve a complex problem by breaking it up into a series of smaller, less complex programs. These simple programs, also called stages, can then be hooked together to get the results you want. The output resulting from a stage is the input to the next stage. A series of stages is called a pipeline. Each stage consists of a stage and its operands. Pipelines has many built-in stages; you may add your own written in Python or pseudo-Rexx.  </p>

<p>Stages may have more than one input and/or output stream; these streams may be connected to other stages in no particular order. </p>

<p>Pipelines is a superset of pipes as found in unix/linux shells. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmann_pipeline for a more detailed description. </p>

<p>Python Pipelines may be invoked from a command prompt or incorporated into another Python program as an imported module. </p>

<p>This project is under construction. Contributions are welcome. Especially Python developers, formal language parsing algorithms, tester (especially those familiar with CMS Pipelines) and potential users. </p>

<p>Also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Pipelines. </p>

<p>Please contact the project manager Bob Gailer: bgailer at gmail dot com or by phone at 1-919-636-4239. </p>

<p>Python Pipelines is based on and is a subset of IBM&#39;s CMS/TSO Pipelines. See the IBM Reference Link at the upper right. </p>

<p>In CMS Pipelines users may write their own stages using the Rexx programming language. Due to the nature of the &#39;dispatcher&#39; (each stage is a co-routine) these program are more complex than they could be. </p>

<p>Python Pipeline supports coding the IBM way (in &#39;pseudo-Rexx&#39;), which makes it somewhat easy to incorporate legacy code or write new stages using a known technology. </p>

<p>Ideally, however, Python Pipeline users learn to write their own stages in Python, using a much simpler approach (each stage has a run() method that is invoked as many times as needed). 7 or more lines of Rexx replaced by 2 lines of Python!</p>

 title : The python-spidermonkey Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Python-SpidermonkeyThis Python module allows for the implementation of Javascript? classes, objects and functions in Python, as well as the evaluation and calling of Javascript scripts and functions. It borrows heavily from Claes Jacobssen&#39;s Javascript Perl module, which in turn is based on Mozilla&#39;s PerlConnect Perl binding. </p>

<p>This code was originally written by John J. Lee in 2003.  After being unmaintained for a number of years, it was subsequently picked up by Atul Varma in 2008. </p>

<p>TutorialThe first thing you&#39;ll want to do is create a Runtime instance, which encapsulates a JSRuntime object from Spidermonkey.  From the JSAPI User Guide: </p>

<p>A JSRuntime, or runtime, is the space in which the Javascript variables, objects, scripts, and contexts used by your application are allocated. Every JSContext and every object in an application lives within a JSRuntime. They cannot travel to other runtimes or be shared across runtimes. Most applications only need one runtime. </p>

<p>Creating the Runtime instance is straightforward: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; from spidermonkey import Runtime
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; rt = Runtime()You&#39;ll then want to use the Runtime to create a Contextinstance, which encapsulates a JSContext object from Spidermonkey. From the JSAPI User Guide: </p>

<p>A JSContext, or context, is like a little machine that can do many things involving Javascript code and objects. It can compile and execute scripts, get and set object properties, call Javascript functions, convert Javascript data from one type to another, create objects, and so on. </p>

<p>In Firefox, for instance, a different context is used for each webpage you view.  A separate context is even created for each physical browser window, because much of Firefox&#39;s functionality is actually written in Javascript.  Contexts can have their own security policies associated with them, and objects can be shared between multiple contexts. </p>

<p>Creating a context in Python-Spidermonkey is done like so: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx = rt.new_context()Now that you&#39;ve got a context, you can do lots of things, like evaluating arbitrary Javascript expressions and using their results in Python code: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx.eval_script(&quot;1 + 2&quot;) + 3
<br/>6We can create classes in Python and access them in Javascript, too: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
<br/>...   def hello(self):
<br/>...     print &quot;Hello, Javascript world!&quot;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx.bind_class(Foo, bind_constructor=True)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx.eval_script(&quot;var f = new Foo(); f.hello();&quot;)
<br/>Hello, Javascript world!We can also get back objects from Javascript and use them: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = cx.eval_script(&quot;f;&quot;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; f.hello()
<br/>Hello, Javascript world!LimitationsThe module currently has a number of features that still need to be implemented.  For instance, it&#39;s not yet possible to call a function defined in Javascript: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx.eval_script(&quot;function foo(x) { return x + 1; }; foo;&quot;)
<br/>{&#39;prototype&#39;: {}}Errors in Javascript code also don&#39;t produce particularly helpful tracebacks: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; cx.eval_script(&quot;3 + undefinedVariable&quot;)
<br/>Traceback (most recent call last):
<br/>...
<br/>JSError: can&#39;t evaluate Javascript scriptInstallationNote that at present, installation has only been tested on OS X and 64-bit Ubuntu Linux; support for Windows is forthcoming. </p>

<p>At present, you&#39;ll need a C compiler on your system to install this extension, as well as the Pyrex package. </p>

<p>Check out the Python-Spidermonkey module from the SVN repository. From the root of your checkout, run: python setup.py buildDon&#39;t worry about the compiler warnings.  Then, with appropriate permissions, run: 
<br/>python setup.py installTestingThe module has a test suite.  Just run: </p>

<p>python test.pyNote that one of the tests currently prints out a Javascript error message.  This isn&#39;t a test failure (though it is a bug). </p>

<p>The intention of the project is to make accounting systems more open, unlike systems as Navision, SummaSummarum, SAP etc. Furthermore the intention is to finally provide a good-looking, extendable and easy-to-use Retail system(POS). </p>

<p>ArchitectureTo get a good technical overview of the system, go to the Architecture page. </p>

<p>ModulesQash consists of several modules - each as a seperate Netbeans project. The purpose of the modules is make Qash more flexible and able to be integrated in most organisations - from small stores to large shops. </p>

<p>CoPlanThe CoPlan module is an Interface API presenting the logic of a firm or division. This includes stock control, accounting, itemlists, orders, invoices, payments and more. </p>

 title : The qcrypto Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the repository for the source code used in a series of quantum key distribution experiments at the National University of Singapore, from key generation in form time-stamped detector data to error correction and privacy amplification. </p>

<p>The code was designed to work with entanglement-based pair detection schemes, either implementing a BB84-type/BBM92 protocol, or an Ekert-91 protocol, which we (Centre for Quantum Technologies) used for our implementations (1,2) of quantum key ditribution systems. </p>

<p>The code is mostly ANSI C, typically compiled with gcc (4.2 or 4.3, but earlier versions also work). We have run the suite mostly on Linux machines running various distros, haven&#39;t tested out anything else because our USB hardware has at the moment only a linux driver. </p>

<p>Discussions on implementation details/problems/leaks are welcome, and should ultimately lead to an openly available implementation of a QKD scheme which hopefully has less open security problems than implementations using proprietary code. We believe that one of the main attack scheme for a quantum key distribution system lies in the software and communication implementation, and would encourage people to try to break it. </p>

<p>We eventually will open hardware specs and detailled designs as well, but please bear with us since this publicization is sort of a side project. Our internal documentation is at the moment somewhat chaotic. But if you have any specific questions, do not hesitate to get in touch with us directly. </p>

<p>In an initial phase, have deposited code which has been running on several linux systems in our labs, and definitions of file formats and hardware. </p>

<p>The currently recommended way of installing it is to draw the complete source tree from the source repository and compile the different elements following the readme instructions. The code as used in (1) and for a demo at the 24C3 conference is currently available as a tarball in the download area here as qcrypto_20071229.tgz. Consolidation for our internal code branches is in progress; the inclusion of all the gui and other components for an implementation of an Ekert91 protocol  is not yet complete. </p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the project, please send an email to the project owner at gmail.com. </p>

<p>NewsWe currently have a visitor, Vadim Makarov from Norway in our group who had an excllent idea how to break the QKD system. It looks like we are a bit in trouble with his attack, and we may get completely compromised. We will probably show up at DEFCON 17 with this scheme, and the hacking hardware if we manage to get together enough manpower. We&#39;ll join the quantum lounge there organized by the guys from NIST. </p>

<p>We may need some help to get the key out of the &#39;classical&#39; communication and the outcome of Vadim&#39;s physical attack hardware - if you are interested, contact us one way or another, we&#39;d appreciate some help. </p>

 title : The qi-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>1. What is Qi? </p>

<p>A language implemented in Common Lisp that generates efficient type secure Lisp programs which you can run on any machine. </p>

<p>2. What advantages does writing in Qi have over writing in Lisp? </p>

<p>Quite a few. </p>

<p> Qi uses pattern-matching instead of forcing you to write in CARs and CDRs. Typically Qi programs have 40% of the non-whitespace characters that Lisp programs have. 2. Qi has optional static type checking. You don&#39;t have to pray your program will not crash with a type error in a real application. 
<br/>3. Qi is lambda-calculus consistent. It makes Common Lisp understand things like partial applications. 
<br/>3. If I choose Qi, do I have to give up Lisp? </p>

<p>Absolutely not. In fact you can mix Qi and Lisp functions into one file and load them together. You can use Lisp functions within Qi code with no problems. You can even add to the type discipline of Qi to tell it about the types of functions that you have written in Lisp and it will accept your information. </p>

<p>4. What advantages does writing in Qi have over writing in ML or Haskell? </p>

<p> Qi runs on top of Lisp, which means that Qi inherits all the features of Lisp that ML and Haskell do not have; (think macros, EVAL, hash-tables, property-lists, metaprogramming ....) 2. Static typing is optional in Qi. You do not have to buy into it if you are dealing with code that is resistant to type checking. Or you can choose to check only that code you are interested in. 
<br/>3. The type discipline of Qi is based on sequent notation which is a much more powerful and flexible tool for defining types than that used in ML or Haskell. To find out why click here.</p>

 summary : <p>QPlib plot libraryQPlib is an open-source 2D plotting library for C++ applications, in particular those which make use of Qt. QPlib is designed to be very easy to use. It makes use of the Trolltech Qt class library, and so can be used on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and MS Windows. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The philosophy behind QPlib: </p>

<p>it should be very easy to use, plots should look &quot;nice&quot;, it should be possible to make plots from the command line (including on Linux/Unix with no X11). </p>

<p>Current plots available include: </p>

<p>line plots, scatter plots, semi-log and log-log plots, error bars, candlesticks, filled curves, bar charts, 1D histograms, 2D histograms, spectrograms, pie charts. </p>

<p>Other features: </p>

<p>5 line styles, 16 symbol types, automatic major and minor ticks or user-defined, custom tick labels, major and minor grids, can have a dependent or independent second y-axis, horizontal and vertical lines can be drawn at user-defined positions, horizontal and vertical transparent shaded regions can be drawn at user-defined positions to highlight regions of interest. </p>

<p>Plots can be saved in a variety of file formats including PNG, PDF and SVG. Plots are also available as QImages, which enables them to be used within GUI applications. (QPlib however is not designed to provide interactive plotting widgets). </p>

<p>Many example codes are included demonstrating how to use all the main features of QPlib. </p>

<p>QPlib is still in a very early stage of development. </p>

 title : The quantumfractals Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AbstractEvent Enhanced Quantum (EEQT) allows for simulation of an individual quantum system on which a simultaneous measurement of several noncommuting observables is being performed. Such a coupling of a quantum system to the measuring devices causes chaotic quantum jumps and fractal-like pattern generation (via nonlinear IFS) on the manifold of quantum states (usually complex projective plane). The simplest example is a 2-dimensional comlex Hilbert space, which leads to fractals on the two-sphere. A short introduction into the subject will be given. It will be then shown that EEQT algorithm works also with indefinite metric, and that here are no negative probabilities. Symmetric configurations of detectors will be shown to generate quantum fractals on the Poincare disk. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The AlgorithmIn applications the vectors  </p>

<p>   n[i], i= 1, 2, ..., Ncan be arbitrary except that they are of unit length, that is they all lie on the surface of the sphere of unit radius, and they add to zero vector:  </p>

<p>   n[1] + n[2] + ... + n[N] = 0- so they are balance each other in such a way that their common center of gravity is at the center of the sphere. </p>

<p>The algorithm describes a sequence of maps of the sphere. These maps are applied, sequentially, to a randomly chosen starting point. Thus what we get is a point on the sphere jumping in a somewhat chaotic way on the surface of the sphere. After 100 000 jumps or so a pattern appear. This pattern is independent of the starting point, as it is usual in chaotic dynamics with an attractor. What we see is an approximation of the attractor set. For instance, for a particular value of the fuzziness parameter alpha = 0.65, and the dodecahedron, we get the following images for 10 000,100 000, 1000 000 and 10 000 000 respectively. The more jumps we generate, the more details of the attractor set shows up. The 100 000 000 dots image shows even more details: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are two separate problems when creating these fractal images, namely that of generating data, and of rendering the generated date into an image.  Let us first discuss the data generating algorithm. This problem itself can be separated into two: a) generating the sequence of points on the sphere, and b) storing these data into an array. Storing the coordinates of all generated points is not a good idea, as it takes lot of space. For instance, if we use 2 bytes for a floating point number, then the picture on the left would require storing space of 600 MB of RAM (storing the data on the disk would essentially slow down the generation process). Therefore we create a double array dj of integers by dividing the unit square into JxJ &quot;pixels&quot;, initialize it to 0 (or to 1), and with each generated point r = (x, y, z) on the unit sphere we increase dj by 1 if the (x, y) coordinates of the point are within (i, j) pixel. So, for instance, the image on the left was created using 400x400 array, and the highest occupation &quot;pixel&quot; got 8029 &quot;hits&quot;. (In fact, we are using two arrays: one for z negative, and one for z positive. So the pictures here are obtained by &quot;looking at the sphere from above&quot; - thus using only z-positive data.). </p>

<p>Given a point r the algorithm first computes probabilities p(i, r) of sum 1:  </p>

<p>   p(1, r) + p(2, r) + ... + p(N, r) = 1 with which we select the map that is to be applied to r. The formula, explained in more details in the paper, reads: </p>

<p>   p(i,r) = (1 + alpha2 + 2 alpha n[i].r )/( N( 1 + alpha2 ))where n[i ].r stands fro the scalar product of n[i ] and r, that is, in our case, for the cosine of the angle between the vectors n[i ] and r, and alpha is the &quot;fuzzy&quot; parameter 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 . Once, for a given current point r, the probability distribution p(i) = p(i, r) is computed, a vertex n[i ] is selected accordingly. Here we follow the standard procedure of selecting a case according to the given probability distribution. In Java code: </p>

<p>// Get random number
<br/>double r=Math.random();</p>

<p>// Check which detector that clicked
<br/>double ptmp = 0;
<br/>double[] detector = null;</p>

<p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; p.length; i++)
<br/>{
<br/>   ptmp += p[i];
<br/>   if (r  (IFS). </p>

<p>Rendering of the imageOnce the data are collected in a pixel array dj, they need to be converted into a picture, either using grayscale or some coloring scheme. For instance one can find the maximum m = max (dj) divide it into 256 equal intervals, and aasign a grayscale value between 0 and 1 to an (i, j) pixel according to the value of dj/m. In fractal images it is neccessary to make some transformation of the array values before, otherwise details of the pattern are lost. For rendering of the greyscale pictures above we have used  </p>

<p>   log10(log10(d[i, j] + 1) + 1) transformation.</p>

 summary : <p>What is it?Quick Look is a package to collect system statistics and output pretty graphics and (X)HTML pages. It allows system administrators to have a quick look on the status of their systems, without going for a more advanced (and heavier) solution. </p>

<p>Quick Look currently shows... </p>

<p>CPU and memory usage Load average and process spawning rates I/O operations Network traffic rates Tracked network connections A static demo is available at http://www.carlos-rodrigues.com/projects/quicklook/demo/. </p>

<p>What does it need to run?Python 2.3 or newer Cheetah 0.9.16 or newer Linux 2.4.27 or newer, 2.6.8 or newer rrdtool 1.0.49 or newer python-rrd 0.2.1 or newer Older versions of any of these packages may work, but haven&#39;t been tested. Newer versions should also work, and you should use them if possible. If you notice any problems, please file a bug report and I&#39;ll try to fix them. </p>

<p>InstallationTo install Quick Look into /opt/quicklook, just run the following commands: </p>

<p>make DESTDIR=/opt/quicklook install cp extras/quicklook.cron /etc/cron.d/stats By default, data files are stored in /var/opt/quicklook and webpages are generated into the /var/www/quicklook directory. If you wish to make changes to the output directories, or you chose a different installation directory, edit the quicklook.cron file before copying it. </p>

<p>Quick Look will now collect data and generate webpages every five minutes. No other steps are needed, but you can always run stats.py without parameters to check out the options available. </p>

<p>Upgrade from 1.0.xWhen using Quick Look 1.0.x, a reboot could cause some of the graphs to have a huge spike. To prevent this from happening, the format for some of the data files (*.rrd) had to be changed. </p>

<p>Newer versions of Quick Look cannot read these files, and they have to be converted if you wish to keep the data contained in them. To do this, you can use the extras/convert.sh script. </p>

<p>For example, if you are storing data files in /var/opt/quicklook (default), they can be converted with the following command: </p>

<p>convert.sh /var/opt/quicklook 
<br/>Backup this directory first, just in case. </p>

<p>Releases</p>

<p>Date  Version  Changes   2008-04-12  1.1  Fixed problem with occasional huge spikes in graphs after rebooting, but existing data files must be converted (see: Upgrade from 1.0.x).   2007-12-01  1.0.2  Fixed problems with disk devices with slashes in their names (e.g. HP SmartArray RAID volumes).   2006-12-17  1.0.1  Fixed problems with dhttpd.

 summary : <p>Like listening to online radio?QuickTuner removes the hassle of browsing and bookmarking out of online radio (aka webradio) and lets you &quot;tunes&quot; and listen like you would a normal radio. </p>

<p>QuickTuner is a radio tuner application which tunes by browsing to the radio&#39;s live streaming webpage and lets the sound streams through without actually having to leave the webpage opens all the time. QuickTuner doesn&#39;t do any fancy tricks it wasn&#39;t meant to do. You tell QuickTuner where your station is, and next time you can tune and listen in as few as 3 click, which is double-clicking the quicktuner icon and clicking the play button. :-) </p>

<p>You can also change stations quickly by selecting from a drop-down list so no bookmarking or remembering anything, you save it once and it&#39;s there like a radio pre</p>
 title : The quipt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What&#39;s qUIpt?qUIpt is a small library that is capable of caching Javascript files inside the users browser - even if SSL is active. qUIpt helps the site owner by reducing  traffic costs and the user with faster page loading. Developers by the way might want to check https://groups.google.com/group/quipt </p>

<p>How does it work?Quite simple  It checks for the contents of window.name while your page is being loaded. If there&#39;s nothing inside the window.name cache the JS files defined by you are fetched via XHR  The same happens if the users enters your site for the first time of his current browser session or if document.referrer is off-domain or empty After that the contents of window.name are being evaluated If the user requests the next page on your domain the JS files are directly taken from window.name - no more requests necessary Is this secure?Yep - if the user enters your site the first time the JS files are requested - no matter what&#39;s already inside window.name An attacker can&#39;t set window.name from other tabs the user might surf on parallely Click for happinessSources Example usage Feedback is always appreciated - especially in this very early stage of the project.</p>

 title : The radia-source Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The operation of radio stations is deﬁned by three main factors: content, production environment, and resources. The content of radio station programming schedules is mostly composed of automated music playlists or programs produced by their authors. Also, content contributions may come from a controlled environment or from different sources. Finally, the availability of human and ﬁnancial resources also have a great impact on their operation.  </p>

<p>Currently, there is no adequate application support for radio stations focused on author programming, that receive content from different sources and have low human and ﬁnancial resources. Radia Source presents a solution for radio stations with the aforementioned characteristics. It is based on an analysis of a station of this type, as well as requirements elicited from several radio stations with similar characteristics.  </p>

<p>The system is based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. It supports the main processes associated with the broadcast in such stations, including the programming schedule deﬁnition, content contribution by authors and its usage for audio playback.</p>

 summary : <p>Radiant Configuration ExtensionThe configuration extensions allows you to configure Radiant through  the Radiant interface.

<p>Unfortunately, some of my extensions allow my end-users to change some configurations. Therefore I created this configuration interface. </p>

<p>How to useJust checkout from SVN in the vendor/extensions folder of your Radiant  installation. </p>

<p>When enabled, this extension will add &#39;Configuration&#39; tab to your Radiant. This tab and the underlying page will only be visible for Administrators. The underlying page displays all configuration keys and their values. The values can easily be altered by the form.</p>

 summary : <p>Rails Support ExtensionExtending Radiant via the standard Rails action pack is a bit painful  right now cause it&#39;s not easy to re-use the Radiant Layouts. </p>

<p>This Radiant Extension allows you to create Radiant Extensions that can  use the normal Rail action pack to create rich database driven application  but which are still tightly integrated via the Radiant layout system. </p>

<p>Quick UsageOnce this extension is installed, update your controllers so that  they extended SiteController.  This extension adds a radiant_render method to the SiteController which is identical to the standard Rails render method except that it uses Radiant to layout the  view. </p>

<p>For example, app/controllers/sample_controller.rb: </p>

<p>class SampleController &lt; SiteController
<br/>  def index    
<br/>    radiant_render :layout=&gt;&quot;path/to/page&quot;
<br/>  end    
<br/>endThe above will look up the Radiant page that maps to URL  &quot;path/to/page&quot; and use that as the template for rendering the  content of the rendered rhtml view.  Instead of using the page&#39;s body part, the result of rendering the rhtml view will be used as the body. </p>

<p>If layout is not specified, it uses the layout of the root page. </p>

<p>This extension also adds a helper to include snippets from Radiant </p>

<p>For example, app/views/sample_controller/index.rhtml: </p>

<p>How to include a snippet:
<br/>Detailed ExampleFor those folks having problems getting started with this extension, I recommend you download and install the following extension which show you how to use the rails_support: http://radiant-rails-support.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/extensions/rails_support_example </p>

<p>These are the steps that were taken to build that example: </p>

<p>1. First generate the extension and example controler </p>

<p>C:\radiant&gt;ruby script\generate extension rails_support_example
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/app/controllers
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/app/helpers
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/app/models
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/app/views
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/db/migrate
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/lib/tasks
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/test/fixtures
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/test/functional
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/test/unit
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/README
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/Rakefile
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/rails_support_example_extension.rb
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/lib/tasks/rails_support_example_extension_tasks.rake
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/test/test_helper.rb
<br/>      create  vendor/extensions/rails_support_example/test/functional/rails_support_example_extension_test.rb</p>

<p>C:\radiant&gt;ruby script\generate extension_controler rails_support_example example
<br/>      exists  app/controllers/
<br/>      exists  app/helpers/
<br/>      create  app/views/example
<br/>      exists  test/functional/
<br/>      create  app/controllers/example_controller.rb
<br/>      create  test/functional/example_controller_test.rb
<br/>      create  app/helpers/example_helper.rb</p>

<p>C:\radiant&gt;2. Add a route in the rails_support_example.rb to your example controller: </p>

<p>  define_routes do |map|
<br/>     map.connect &#39;example/:action/:id&#39;, :controller =&gt; &#39;example&#39;
<br/>  end3. Update your controller so that it extends SiteController </p>

<p>4. Add the index action to the example controller </p>

<p>  def index
<br/>    radiant_render 
<br/>  end5. Add a the app\views\example\index.rhtml view file: </p>

<p>  Hi this file is &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>  Please define a snippet called &quot;welcome&quot;, and it will be rendered after this:</p>

<p>Based on the plugin by Brandalism. </p>

<p>InstallationPut the javascript/extensions/tinymce folder in the public folder of your Radiant installation: svn checkout http://radiant-tinymce-extension.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascripts/extensions/tinymce public/javascript/extensions/tiny_mceCopy the tinymce_filter folder to your vendor/extensions folder svn checkout http://radiant-tinymce-extension.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tinymce_filter vendor/extensions/tinymce_filterBy default, TinyMCE will look for a /stylesheets/content.css file to use in the editor. If you want to add your own styling to the editor, you can create this file. Radiant code will automatically get a class name. Add the following CSS to your content.css file: .mceItemRadiantCode { 
<br />  background: url(&#39;../javascripts/extensions/tiny_mce/plugins/codeprotect/images/radiant-code.png&#39;) no-repeat; 
<br />  height: 18px;
<br />  border: none;
<br />}SettingsIf you want to change the settings of the editor, you can do this by editing the &#39;tiny_mce_settings.js&#39; file. The &#39;codeprotect&#39; plugin is used to protect the Radiant tags from being edited within the editor. </p>

 title : The ragona-as3utils Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ragona-as3utils (com.ragona.utils) is a growing set of tools for use in Flash projects. At this early stage it is only maintained for: </p>

<p>• Actionscript 3.0, Flash 9+. </p>

<p>The following classes are currently included: </p>

<p>Sender(com.ragona.utils.sender.Sender.as): </p>

<p>Sender is a simple set of classes that I use to replace &#39;trace&#39; functionality. The issue with trace is that it only works within the Flash IDE, and once your site is live it&#39;s difficult to debug certain issues. This is a simple set of classes used for for live project debugging. By uploading reciever.swf and changing from trace to sendMessage() you can view your trace output on any computer, within a web browser. In the future I will extend Reciever to include search functionality, file exporting, and other useful features that Trace lacks. This is an early implementation, but even now I refuse to work without it during development, it&#39;s just that useful, especially for projects that involve server-side or JavaScript interaction, and must be run within a browser - where tracing isn&#39;t an option without unreliable browser extensions.   </p>

<p>CoreXML (com.ragona.utils.coreXML.CoreXML.as): </p>

<p>A really simple XML class for easy loading in AS3. It dispatches an &#39;xmlLoaded&#39; event that can be listened for in parent classes, and is generally saves me from writing the same XML code over an over. It was specifically intended to be extended, and works well with subclasses. </p>

<p>XMLPathfinder (com.ragona.utils.coreXML.XMLPathfinder.as): </p>

<p>This is a class I created for use with Flash deeplinking solutions, SWFAddress for example. I wanted a way to take URL string, &quot;/portfolio/web/2041/&quot; for example, and parse through an XML document based on a unique attribute, named &#39;local&#39;. It returns an XML typed object, which in my own projects I use to load data based on user URL input. It can be integrated into any XML document by adding @local attributes to the XML nodes that you need to navigate through, as long the attribute is unique for each level.  </p>

<p>This project is really just for personal use, but if it is useful for anyone you&#39;re welcome to pick it apart and take what you can.</p>

 summary : <p>I play WoW, and when I raid, I have to sign up on a forum posting. This script sends emails whenever there is a new posting in the &quot;Line-Ups and Sign-Ups&quot; forum. </p>

<p>From the forumHey guys. I&#39;m not entirely sure whether or not any of you are nerds like me, but if you&#39;re technically inclined, I figured I&#39;d post a little script I just whipped up. </p>

<p>What it does is spit out all of the currently available line-ups for your raid group, and sends you a notification via email when it sees a new line-up posted. </p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I should mention that I have done no testing as to whether or not the script will work for you. In fact, unless you run Mac OS X or some flavor of Linux, you should probably abandon all hope of using this. I can&#39;t support Windows, sorry!  </p>

<p>To Install:Copy/paste the code to a text file and save it (I recommend something like &quot;equil.rb&quot;). Edit the first couple variables to suit your needs. They begin with dollar signs. If you don&#39;t want it to email you, delete the $toList lines. Open a terminal and run ruby /the/location/you/saved/it The program should return however many current line-ups are out. If you set up the email correctly, you will get an email for each. Notes:If you use a Mac, you&#39;ll have to run sudo postfix start for the mail functionality to work. It will prompt you for your password. If you use Linux, a mail application is likely running already. </p>

 title : The rails-fast-sessions Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Fast SessionsFastSessions is a sessions class for ActiveRecord sessions store created to work fast (really fast). It uses some techniques which are not so widely known in developers&#39; community and only when they cause huge problems, performance consultants are trying to help with them. </p>

<p>The ProblemOriginal ActiveRecord sessions store is slow. It is fine for some low traffic blogs, but it is too slow to use it on some big/large/huge sites. First of all, it is slow because ActiveRecord is slow. It is powerful ORM framework, but it is overkill for such simple task as a sessions management. </p>

<p>There are other possible solutions like cookie session store (session size is limited, no sensible data in sessions), memcached (too much RAM when you have many sessions + no persistence). </p>

<p>That is why people created SqlSession store. It works with mysql directly with database APIs and works much faster than original AR session store. But it is still slow because: </p>

<p>it creates/updates session on each hit - even dumb bots crawling your sites create thousands of thousands of useless records in your sessions table, 99% of hits do not require any session updates! it uses 32-char string as a key for sessions records - all databases work with string keys MUCH slower that with integers keys, so it would be much better to use integers, but we have so long session ids and all session stores use these session ids as a key. it uses auto_increment primary key, which causes table-level locks in InnoDB for all MySQL versions prior to 5.1.21. These table-level locks with unnecessary inserts cause really weird problems for large sites. The SolutionFastSessions plugin was born as a hack created for Scribd.com (large RoR-based web project), which was suffering from InnoDB auto-increment table-level locks on sessions table.  </p>

<p>So, first of all, we removed id field from the table. Next step was to make lookups faster and we&#39;ve used a following technique: instead of using (session_id) as a lookup key, we started using (CRC32(session_id), session_id) - two-columns key which really helps MySQL to find sessions faster because key cardinality is higher (so, mysql is able to find a record earlier w/o checking a lots of index rows). We&#39;ve benchmarked this approach and it shows 10-15% performance gain on large sessions tables. </p>

<p>And last, but most powerful change we&#39;ve tried to make was to not create database records for empty sessions and to not save sessions data back to database if this data has not been changed during current request processing. With this change we basically reduce inserts number by 50-90% (depends 0n application). </p>

<p>All of these changes were implemented and you can use them automatically after a simple plugin installation. </p>

<p>Controversial DecisionsMany plugin users would never think about one problem we&#39;ve introduced when removed that auto-increment primary key, so I&#39;d like to describe it here. The problem is following. </p>

<p>InnoDB groups all data in tables by primary key. This means that when we create auto-increment primary key and insert records to a table, our sessions records are grouped together and saved sequentially on the disk. But if we&#39;ll make pretty random value (like crc32 of a random session id) a primary key, then every session record will be inserted in its own place and it will generate some random I/O which is not so good for I/O bound servers. </p>

<p>So, we decided to let the user choose what primary key to use in his deployment of our plugin, so if you&#39;re going to use this module with MySQL 5.1.22+, then you&#39;dlike to set  </p>

<p>  CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore::FastSessions.use_auto_increment = truebecause it will provide you with consecutive data inserts in InnoDB. Another cases when you&#39;d like to use it is when your MySQL server is I/O bound now and you do not want to add random I/O because of randomized primary key. </p>

<p>Working With Old AR Sessions TableIf you do not like to loose old sessions created with default AR sessions plugin, you could set  </p>

<p>  CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore::FastSessions.fallback_to_old_table = trueand then all session reads will fall back to old sessions table if some session_id was not found in default fast sessions table. Old sessions table name could be set using  </p>

<p>  CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore::FastSessions.old_table_name variable. </p>

<p>This options make sessions slower so I&#39;d recommend to use it during transition to new sessions table only. In this case you&#39;ll save your new sessions to the new table and will be able to drop old sessions table when your session expiration time will be over (we use 2 month period so in 2 months we&#39;ll be able to drop this old table and turn this option off).  </p>

<p>InstallationThis plugin installation is pretty simple and described in a few steps below: </p>

<p>1) Install this plugin sources in your vendor/plugins directory (it could be ./script/plugin install, or piston import command - it is up to you) from our SVN reposipory. For example: </p>

<p>$  piston import http://rails-fast-sessions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ vendor/plugins/fast_sessions2) Enable ActiveRecord session store in your config/environment.rb file: </p>

<p>  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
<br/>    ......
<br/>    config.action_controller.session_store = :active_record_store
<br/>    ......
<br/>  end3) Create migration for your new sessions table: </p>

<p> $ ./script/generate fast_session_migration AddFastSessions4) Open your newly created migration and change table_name and use_auto_increment parameters of the plugin (if you want to). </p>

<p>5) Run your migration: </p>

<p>$  rake db:migrate6) Start your application and try to perform some actions which would definitely save some data to your session. Then check your fast_sessions table (if you did not renamed it) for a records. </p>

<p>UsageThe objective of this plugin is to: </p>

<p>implement a conventional method for migrating mssql procs, views, and triggers. for legacy mssql databases, resolve camel-cased attributes to Rails&#39; conventional underscored names, allowing developers to refer to model object attributes in the conventional manner: - model.user_name vs. model.UserName (camel-case is a common naming convention  
<br/>in the MS dev community)

<br/>camel-case and underscore)</p>
 title : The rails-multifielddate-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MultiFieldDateDescriptionThis is a Ruby on Rails plugin for use with tables/models that need to allow incomplete dates (e.g., just the year and month or just the month and day). Requires that the table have four fields: year, month, day, and full date. When the year, month, and day fields are present, the full date field is updated. </p>

<p>There are two ways to use this plugin: </p>

<p>acts_as_multi_field_date multi_field_date </p>

<p>acts_as_multi_field_date only allows one date_field per model. e.g., </p>

<p>class Birth &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  acts_as_multi_field_date :date_field =&gt; &#39;birth_date&#39;
<br/>  #assumes year, month, and day fields are &#39;year&#39;, &#39;month&#39;, and &#39;day&#39; by default.
<br/>  #can be changed: 
<br/>  # acts_as_multi_field_date :date_field =&gt; &#39;birth_date&#39;, :day_field =&gt; &#39;bday&#39;
<br/>endmulti_field_date, on the other hand, allows multiple dates in a model, e.g., </p>

<p>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  multi_field_date :birth, :date_field =&gt; &#39;birth_date&#39;, :year_field =&gt; &#39;birth_year&#39;,
<br/>    :month_field =&gt; &#39;birth_month&#39;, :day_field =&gt; &#39;birth_day&#39;
<br/>  multi_field_date :death, :date_field =&gt; &#39;death_date&#39;, :year_field =&gt; &#39;death_year&#39;,
<br/>    :month_field =&gt; &#39;death_month&#39;, :day_field =&gt; &#39;death_day&#39;
<br/>endIt also includes a helper method for displaying a partially completed date, and some helpers for generating arrays for HTML select menus.  Includes rather extensive unit test coverage (requires SQLite3). </p>

 summary : <p>Postman is a simple rails plugin that calculates shipping rates based on data from the database. It is meant for cases where the postal service does not have an API for getting the shipping rates. </p>

<p>What Postman does is to get the values from the tables and calculate it out. The values are found in your database tables. You&#39;d have to add the mailing rates into the tables for it to work. </p>

<p>The plugin is very simple. I&#39;ve included some sql files to help put in the countries and mailing rates(in Singapore). You can use them as a reference. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s the original rates: </p>

<p>Generate and apply the migration: </p>

<p>ruby script/generate postman_migration  
<br/>rake db:migrate  
<br/>Add values into the tables </p>

<p>countries  destinations  postage_mails  step_rates  step_weights  transit_time  weight_limit  Definition of the tables </p>

<p>destinations </p>

<p>the term for the group of countries. Usually postal services group countries up by distance, and set different rates for each zone.  postage_mails </p>

<p>corresponding rates for the weight  weight_limit </p>

<p>the maximum weight limit for the rates from postage_mails  step_rates </p>

<p>the unit rates for additional weight beyond the weight limit  step_weight </p>

<p>the divisor used to divide up the additional weight  transit_time </p>

<p>the time needed to ship to the destinations  How to use it </p>

<p>Just call </p>

<p>Postman.postageCalculator(&quot;Singapore&quot;, 100) </p>

<p>the first argument is the coutry in text, the second argument is the weight in your base unit(which happens to be grams for me) Testing </p>

 summary : <p>基于Ruby on Rail的SCM(软件配置管理）WEB应用。为软件企业、开发团队提供对软件代码、文档、数据等所有配置项的高效管理。 </p>

<p>SCM是比版本控制更高一级的管理工具，比如不同项目之间共享产品，产品之间共享程序模块等。SCM的关键是变更控制：比如一个现场的问题、一个改进建议（Issue,事件）会触发哪些变更， 而这个变更又涉及了哪些程序单元（配置项，一组文件）的哪个版本，影响到了哪些现场项目，其他产品会不会受到影响？这些任务的管理需要由系统来支持，仅靠CVS等版本控制系统是不够的。 </p>

<p>SCM之所以重要，可以从许多公司和团队发生的下列问题来看出： </p>

<p>● 找不到软件：&quot;我知道我写完了，但是不知道把它放在那了&quot;； </p>

<p>● 相互覆盖代码：开发人员对相同的代码做不同的修改，互相覆盖，必然至少有一个人很郁闷； </p>

<p>● 无法返回：新的修改比原来的代码还差劲，不能返回原来的版本； </p>

<p>● 版本混乱：那份程序应该给用户呢；出错了，应该打那个版本的补丁呢； </p>

<p>● 管理和归档意识混乱： </p>

<p>－客户打电话：&quot;出问题了&quot;； </p>

<p>－程序员解决了问题，但是没有进行变更登记； </p>

<p>－在没有修改包含在内的情况下进行联编软件； </p>

<p>－把未修改的软件交付用户； </p>

<p>－客户打电话：&quot;还有问题&quot;； </p>

<p>－操作员：&quot;我的确已经修改了&quot;  等等 </p>

<p>   本SCM系统已经开发完成C/S版本,已经实际应用并产生很好的效果。现在将扩展基于WEB的查询和变更管理功能，并逐步将整个产品移植到rails平台。 </p>

 summary : <p>The Rails Live CD project was born on Ezra Zygmuntowicz&#39; blog and realized with help from Brian Ketelsen. It is based on PCLinuxOS which is a great Linux distribution for creating LiveCDs. More information at PCLinusOS.com</p>

<p>To use it, just download, burn and reboot! Or if you have a virtualization or emulation engine like Qemu, Parallels or VMWare it is even easier.</p>

<p>Many people are curious about Ruby on Rails but don&#39;t want to go through the pain of installing it locally. The Rails Live CD solves this problem by allowing you to have a fully operating Ruby on Rails development environment without even touching your hard drive! Others are interested in developing Ruby on Rails applications in Linux but don&#39;t have the skills or the patience to do the installation and compiling required to get Ruby on Rails running on a typical Linux installation. Rails Live CD allows you to install directly to your hard drive and walks you through the process. No compiling or ./configure ./make ./make install dancing required.</p>

<p>RailsLiveCD.org is hosted on RailsPlayground.Net using Typo with a very nice theme created by Amy Hoy of Slash7 fame.</p>

 summary : <p>RCompCompile your applications with Rake and Ruby!This project currently targets .NET applications but it could be extended to include various other languages and platforms. Tools like MSBuild and NAnt are great but they work with sometimes cryptic configuration files. If you have a small project and you would like to automate your builds with Rake and Ruby, this project may be for you! </p>

<p>How ToHere&#39;s a simple task that compiles all of the source files in the &quot;src&quot; directory into an executable along with a debug file: </p>

<p>RComp::DotNet::CscTask.new do |t|
<br/>    Dir.glob(&quot;src/*.cs&quot;).each { |input| t.inputs &lt;&lt; input}
<br/>    t.references &lt;&lt; &quot;System.Data.dll&quot;
<br/>    t.target = &quot;winexe&quot;
<br/>    t.out = &quot;bin/MyProgram.exe&quot;
<br/>    t.debug = true
<br/>endCompiler OptionsRComp can easily be customized. You can control compiler options through instance accessors like target but you can also add options using these methods: </p>

<p>add_option(name, value)RComp :DotNet::CscTask.new do |t|
<br/>    t.add_option :platform, &quot;x64&quot;
<br/>endcompiler_optionsRComp :DotNet::CscTask.new do |t|
<br/>    t.compiler_options[:platform] = &quot;/platform:x64&quot;

 summary : <p>OverviewRattle (the R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily) provides a simple and logical interface for data mining. It is a new data mining application based on the open source and free statistical language R  using the Gnome  graphical interface. The application runs under GNU/Linux and MS/Windows. The aim is to provide an intuitive interface that takes you through the basic steps of data mining, as well as illustrating the R code that is used to achieve this. Whilst the tool itself may be sufficient for all of a user&#39;s needs, it also provides a stepping stone to more sophisticated processing and modelling in R itself, for sophisticated and unconstrained data mining. </p>

 summary : <p>RBScoutSubmit is a small set of REALbasic classes that can be used to submit crash data from your REALbasic application to your FogBugz installation. </p>

<p> How To Use  </p>

<p>1) Copy the RBScoutSubmit folder and it&#39;s contents into your REALbasic project. </p>

<p>2) Add RBScoutSubmit class as a property of the main App class. </p>

<p>3) Copy code from RBScoutSubmitExample project&#39;s App.UnhandledException into your own project. </p>

<p>4) Change URL, ScoutProject, ScoutArea and ScoutUserName to reflect your FogBugz install and project for this application. </p>

<p>If you want to use the stack trace functionality in your app, copy the StackCleaner folder into your project, otherwise comment out the code in the UnhandledException example code that uses StackArray. </p>

<p>It is STRONGLY recommended that you try the RBScoutSubmitExample project with your own URL, ScoutProject, ScoutArea and ScoutUserName settings to test that it all works before updating your own project. </p>

<p>Remember, none of this is going to work unless you have a publicly available FogBugz scoutSubmit.asp or scoutSubmit.php page.</p>

<p>What is it?A active specification framework for Ruby. Based largely on Concordion for Java, but was influenced by FIT as well. </p>

<p>What does it do?Paraphrasing the definition of Concordion: </p>

<p>Ruby Concordion is an open source framework for Ruby that lets you turn a plain English description of a requirement into an automated test -- an active specification. </p>

<p>Where can I see what it actually does?See the wiki for more information on ruby-concordion. In particular the following pages provide good starting points for understanding concordion: </p>

<p>Tutorial RCorOverview WhatRcorActuallyDoes ComplexExample   Since Rails is so widely used lately, a lot of people want to know about using RCor and Rails together.  A short demo is available: RailsAndRCor </p>

 title : The rdba Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RDBA is intended to be to Ruby what JDBC is to Java - a cross-DBMS API for data access. RDBA is an adaptation in the sense that it will not strictly conform to the JDBC API. Instead, it will use Ruby conventions (e.g., method naming conventions) whenever possible and use Ruby features (e.g., closures) to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p>The 0.1 version of RDBA will support Oracle. Future releases will support Postgres, MySQL, and other commercial RDBMS&#39;s.</p>
 title : The rdbc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RDBC is intended to be to Ruby what JDBC is to Java - a universal, cross-DBMS API for data access. RDBC is an adaptation in the sense that it does not follow the JDBC specification exactly. Instead, Ruby conventions (e.g., method naming conventions) will be followed whenever possible and Ruby features (e.g., closures) will be used to the greatest degree possible.</p>

<p>The initial 0.1 version of RDBC will support Oracle. Successive versions will provide support for Postgres, MySQL, and other DBMS&#39;s.</p>

 title : The recipejar Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WelcomeI wanted to come up with a digital replacement for my Mom&#39;s old-box-of-3x5-cards method of recipe organization, and this is it.  </p>

<p>RecipeJar doesn&#39;t get in your way.  Simple enough for Grandma, but flexible enough for the food loving computer geek in the family.  You can just leave your recipes organized alphabetically, or if you feel like getting fancy, you can add Tags/Labels/Categories (e.g.;whatever you want to call them).  You can even search by Ingredient, if that strikes your fancy.   </p>

<p>Recipes are stored as simple HTML files, you can read them using your favorite browser or even publish the entire folder as a standalone website.  Truly Geeky users can write their own editing commands (useful for inserting HTML formatting), write templates for the index and recipe files, create alternate style sheets, and even teach RecipeJar to recognize new units. </p>

<p>Installation is simple: On OSX just open the dmg and drag to the applications folder, on all other systems just run the jar file. </p>

<p>If you try it out, and want to let me know what you thought of it or want to report a bug, send me an email at: yehoodig {at} gmail {dot} com.</p>
 title : The recipesonrails Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I love cooking, I&#39;m not the greatest bcook in the world but I&#39;m also not the worst.  For years now Ive kept a little folder of recipes and sometimes found my writing really difficult to understand which made for some interesting alternatives to the originals.  Now I am sure there are a million and one things that do exactly the same as this application but none of those are done by me. </p>

<p>So I used this an an excuse to form my little pet project done in Ruby On Rails.  Now if you have read the About page you&#39;ll know that I originally started the project in PHP, then switched to Perl (Catalyst MVC) and eventually moved the whole thing into Ruby because I enjoyed the instant results that I was getting. </p>

<p>Of course I had problems and was using it rreally to learn more about Ruby but I got to a point at the end of 2007 that I got so annoyed I decided to just release it which would spur me on to make it better.  Which it has.  From the start of the year I have already fixed a few things and changed some of the code so that it fits in more with the DRY methodology. </p>

<p>I intend to do some more on the project and you should consult the wiki here for my current plans on whats being thought about, implemented and wwhat I want to change.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>INSTALLATION </p>

<p>To install, simply run: </p>

<p>#script/plugin install https://woc.springloops.com/source/recommendation </p>

<p>You&#39;ll then need to make the ratings table.  You should probably make a migration to do so, which you can do with the following command: </p>

<p>script/generate migration add_recommend_user script/generate migration add_recommend_rating script/generate migration add_recommend_item </p>

<p>Then edit the resulting migration source that it puts in db/migrate (it will be named something like 015_add_recommend_user.rb, the number at the beginning of the filename will probably be different in your instance). </p>

<p>The table needed by the plugin needs to be named &quot;users&quot; and have two columns in addition to the primary key. Also, The table named &quot;ratings&quot; have five columns and the table named &quot;item&quot; have five columns </p>

<p>They are: </p>

<p>+ users id          integer name        string </p>

<p>+ ratings id          integer user_id     integer item_id     integer rating      string ts          string </p>

<p>+ items id          integer title       string </p>

<p>You can do this in your migration with the following code: </p>

<p>+user </p>

<p>def self.up </p>

<p>create_table :users do |t| 
<br/>t.column :name, :string 
<br/>end 
<br/>end </p>

<p>def self.down </p>

<p>drop_table :users 
<br/>end </p>

<p>+rating </p>

<p>def self.up 
<br/>create_table :ratings do |t| 
<br/>t.column :user_id, :integer 
<br/>t.column :item_id, :integer 
<br/>t.column :rating, :string 
<br/>t.column :ts, :string 
<br/>end 
<br/>end 
<br/>def self.down 
<br/>drop_table :ratings 
<br/>end 
<br/>  </p>

<p>+item </p>

<p>def self.up 
<br/>create_table :items do |t| 
<br/>t.column :title, :string 
<br/>end 
<br/>end 
<br/>def self.down 
<br/>drop_table :items 
<br/>end 
<br/>  </p>

<p>After saving the migration run the following from the top-level directory of your rails application: $ rake migrate (rake db:migrate) </p>

<p>After that, you should have everything you need setup and ready to go. </p>

<p>It probably wouldn&#39;t hurt to run through the included unit tests quickly, but you don&#39;t have to: </p>

<p>$ rake test:plugins </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>USING THE PLUGIN </p>

<p>Pretty simple, really.  You just need to add &quot;acts_as_userbased_recommnedable&quot; or &quot;acts_as_itembased_recommendable&quot; at the top of your ActiveRecord model, and everything should magically become available to you :) </p>

<p>Carefully, &quot;acts_as_userbased_recommnedable&quot; be included in ActiveRecord model like &quot;User&quot;, and &quot;acts_as_itembased_recommendable&quot; be included in ActiveRecord model like &quot;Item&quot;. </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>The Basics: </p>

<p>Any model that &quot;acts_as_userbased_recommnedable&quot; or &quot;acts_as_itembased_recommnedable&quot; 
<br/>has the following methods available to it: 
<br/>          </p>

<p>&quot;acts_as_userbased_recommnedable&quot; 
<br/>similar_users : Find simiar users. Score that evaluatie item is simiar to each others 
<br/>recommend_items : Recommend item. The recommended item is based on similarity among users. </p>

<p>        </p>

<p>&quot;acts_as_itembased_recommnedable&quot;

 title : The recommendengin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The recordselect Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RecordSelect is a Rails widget to help you pick one record out of many. I designed it as a more usable and performant alternative to generating a massive dropdown list. It relies on AJAX for the cooler uses (all the provided view helpers rely on JavaScript) but can also function in a pure-http fashion (although multi-select support is provided in a pure-JavaScript implementation). </p>

<p>Go ahead and check out the demo app to really see how it works! Or go straight to installing the plugin into your own app. </p>

 summary : <p>About RedFlagWelcome. RedFlag is a next generation Del.icio.us client for Mac OS X that intends to make a simple and yet very capable bookmark manager capable of organizing your bookmarks efficiently and help you able to retrieve them in a fast manner while deeply tapping into all the great technologies Mac OS X has to offer.  </p>

<p>In other words we all have a lot of bookmarks that are both local on the browser and on del.icio.us. While del.icio.us is a great web access for bookmarks I believe we can do much much better as a native client and vastly surpass all other native clients in terms of how we can organize your bookmarks. Most Del.icio.us native clients just show a list of your tags, but what if you want more? RedFlag was created to push the limits what these clients are capable of and let you group tags together, or filter your bookmarks on your terms and help you get to the bookmark your looking for fast in a method that is convenient for you. </p>

<p>What does RedFlag run on?RedFlag will only run on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard as it takes advantage of recent features in leopard such as Objective-C 2.0, Garbage Collection, NSOperation multithreading and more.  </p>

<p>Why the name RedFlag?Originally this was going to be called Socialist till someone actually came out with a Mac Del.icio.us client with the same name. My first project AssignmentTracker X, had a very serious name to it and so I wanted to use a vastly more casual name to this project. Taking an idea from the FLOSS Weekly podcast where Jeremy Allison was a guest, he made the joke &quot;oh I&#39;m a communist and I want to destroy the software industry...&quot; When I heard that I decided to use the name RedFlag that makes a joke at this stereotype reference.</p>

 summary : <p>BACKGROUND TO THE MUSEUM: &quot;Rising above the ragtag roofs of nearby shacks and concrete-block houses, the imposing Red Location Museum provides a vivid contrast to the bleak landscape of the former black township of New Brighton, South Africa. Located 400 miles east of Cape Town, just outside Port Elizabeth, New Brighton sits in the shadow of factories and a giant power plant and pushes hard against the multiple tracks of a busy railway line. Since the dismantling of apartheid in 1994, the community has struggled to make the transition from a 100-year-old segregated township for underpaid laborers into a real town with previously unthinkable assets, such as decent housing, modern infrastructure, a wide array of businesses, diversified transportation options, and civic institutions. The museum is a vital part of this transformation. </p>

<p>The Red Location Museum emerged from a national competition in 1998 for the design of a civic precinct. Each entrant prepared a master plan that included a museum dedicated to the struggle against apartheid, an arts center and gallery, a market, a library, a community hall, and some housing—in the township’s oldest neighborhood, called Red Location for the color of the corrugated-iron siding used on its oldest houses. </p>

<p>Noero Wolff Architects, a small, Cape Town–based firm with a record of inventive projects in the townships, won the competition with a scheme that was both dignified and lively. The 31,500-square-foot museum, with its adjacent outdoor amphitheater, is the first major building from the master plan to be completed, with the others to be done by 2010. The museum serves as the soul of the new precinct. In the drawn-out struggle against racism and apartheid, the citizens of New Brighton were early and dedicated participants in civil disobedience, boycotts, and even antiapartheid violence, and much of this activity took place in Red Location. The museum honors the people involved in this struggle by telling their stories to visitors from the community and around the world.  </p>

<p>Under apartheid, black and “colored” people were forbidden to visit museums, libraries, and other cultural buildings, except as employees, entering through the back door. As a result, such buildings have little positive resonance with the people of New Brighton. So Jo Noero and Heinrich Wolff had to invent a different kind of architecture, one that would be approachable and meaningful to people with no direct experience of museums. They developed a robust, though refined, industrial aesthetic for the museum, creating a huge, singular volume enclosed by a concrete frame in-filled with concrete block. A sawtooth roof echoes the forms found in the manufacturing zone across the train tracks while also honoring the antiapartheid movement’s history of organizing in factory settings. The resulting architecture is simultaneously familiar and free&quot;. Quote Lisa Finley</p>

To use this, or any of my reflection randoms to be, just simply call FindReflectionRandoms followed by SRL&#39;s FindNormalRandoms 
<br/>I also have my BETA path walker! It is unique because it waits until the next tile is on the mini-map, then it clicks that tile as soon as it can. This makes it look and act more human. It helps to make the tiles only 3/4 of the maps length away. Don&#39;t try to stretch out the tiles!

 summary : <p>version 0.9.5 - added  Maven repository, UseCases, javadoc, JavaCodeSerializer, getResources, Vfs </p>

<p>A Java runtime metadata analysis, in the spirit of ScannotationsReflections scans your classpath, indexes the metadata, allows you to query it on runtime and may save and collect that information for many modules within your project. </p>

<p>Using Reflections you can query your metadata such as: </p>

<p>get all subtypes of some type get all types/methods/fields annotated with some annotation, w/o annotation parameters matching get all resources matching matching a regular expression </p>

<p>How to use?a typical use of Reflections would be: </p>

<p>     Reflections reflections = new Reflections(&quot;my.project.prefix&quot;);</p>

<p>     Set&gt; subTypes = reflections.getSubTypesOf(SomeClassOrInterface.class);</p>

<p>     Set&gt; annotated = reflections.getTypesAnnotatedWith(SomeAnnotation.class);</p>

<p>     Set&gt; annotated1 = reflections.getTypesAnnotatedWith(
<br/>          new SomeAnnotation() {public String value() {return &quot;1&quot;;}
<br/>                                public Class annotationType() {return SomeAnnotation.class;}});</p>

<p>     Set propertiesFiles = reflections.getResources(Pattern.compile(&quot;.*\\.properties&quot;)); //depends on ResourcesScanner configured, as on next examplebasically, to use Reflections for scanning and querying, instantiate it with a Configuration, for example </p>

<p>     new Reflections(new ConfigurationBuilder()
<br/>          .filterInputsBy(new FilterBuilder.Include(FilterBuilder.prefix(&quot;my.project.prefix&quot;)))
<br/>          .setUrls(ClasspathHelper.getUrlsForPackagePrefix(&quot;my.project.prefix&quot;))
<br/>          .setScanners(new SubTypesScanner(),
<br/>                       new TypeAnnotationsScanner().filterResultsBy(filter),
<br/>                       new ResourcesScanner()));than use the convenient methods to query the metadata, such as getSubTypesOf, getTypesAnnotatedWith, getMethodsAnnotatedWith and more.  </p>

<p>You can use other scanners defined in Reflections as well, such as: SubTypesScanner, TypeAnnotationsScanner, FieldAnnotationsScanner, MethodAnnotationsScanner, ResourcrsScanner and more. Than use the equivalent query method in the Reflections object. </p>

<p>browse the javadoc for more info </p>

<p>also, browse the tests directory to see some more examples </p>

<p>MavenRepoto use Reflections via a maven repository, configure your pom.xml with </p>

<p>    reflections-repo
<br/>    Reflections Maven2 Repository
<br/>    http://reflections.googlecode.com/svn/repo
<br/>than add a dependency to Reflections in your pom.xml </p>

<p>    org.reflections
<br/>    reflections
<br/>    the latest version...
<br/>UseCasesReflections can also: </p>

<p>save scanned metadata and collect it later on runtime, for quick bootstrap of your application save your model entities metadata - fully qualified name of packages and types, fields and methods - so you can later reference these in a static manner find all resources matching a regular expression (for example find all .properties files or .xml files) </p>

<p>see the UseCases wiki page </p>

<p>Reflections Maven pluginThere is the ReflectionsMojo Maven plugin available for your project. With simple configuration you can save all scanned metadata into xml files upon compiling. Later on, when your project is bootstrapping you can let Reflections collect all those resources and re-create that metadata for you, making it available at runtime without re-scanning the classpath - thus reducing the bootstrapping time. </p>

<p>Use this maven configuration in your pom file: </p>

<p>    
<br/>        
<br/>            
<br/>                org.reflections
<br/>                reflections-maven
<br/>                the latest version...

<br/>                    
<br/>                
<br/>            
<br/>        
<br/>    than, on runtime: </p>

<p>        Reflections reflections =
<br/>                isProduction() ? Reflections.collect() : new Reflections(&quot;your.package.here&quot;);Check out in the ReflectionsMojo wiki page </p>

<p>Extending ReflectionsYou can easily extend Reflections by : </p>

<p>create your specialized scan class, should implement Scanner provide a query method within that scan class next, use that scanner instance to first configure Reflections and than to query </p>

<p>patches and extension are welcomed! </p>

 title : The restdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RestDB is a framework, means you can expose any database with a RESTful service. </p>

<p>The main concept of RestDB is CoC (Convention over Configuration), With the framework, you can access your database with a RESTful URI,  </p>

<p>For example, you have a MySQL database, and the database name is Blog, it contains a table named Users, and you suppose to access the data in the users with the following URI: </p>

<p>http://localhost/blog/usersAnd if in a browser, it should return a page to you, and it&#39;s just like the Scaffolding you ever seen in other frameworks like RoR(Ruby on Rails) </p>

<p>You can also work with RestDB in a programmatic way. Read more in our wiki Page. </p>

<p>All in all, with RestDB, you can expose your database as a simple web service.</p>

 title : The restfulphp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The restian Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RESTianThe goal of the RESTian project is multi-faceted and influenced by the immortal words of Alan Kay &quot;We aim to make simple things simple and complex things possible.&quot; Its first goal will be to create a Framework for building RESTful Web Services and its latter goal will be to define a Service Interface Schema for RESTful Web Services. </p>

<p>Initial ImplementationThe initial implementation languages are JavaScript for the client and PHP v4 on MySQL for the server.  The initial target platform for testing and example services is Drupal v5.x.  The initial content types for request and response are &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; and JSON, respectively. </p>

<p>REST FrameworkThe initial goal is to create a framework for both clients and servers optimized for rapid and easy development of fully RESTful Web Services that can be reasonably easily evolved to be fully robust without requiring a change to the externally-facing service interface. RESTian will initially aim to streamline creating CRUD-based operations for SQL databases as well as services using purpose-built functions and will hopefully later look to simplify interface with other back-ends(1). </p>

<p>REST Service Interface SchemaThe longer term goal will be to identify the schema required to drive RESTful web services that can be represented in practically any language and that can easily be transformed between languages formats. The schema will provide necessary information to (almost) any language capable (2) of serving dynamic content via HTTP and a subset of the schema will provide the necessary information to allow clients to make requests of the same RESTful web services thus satisfying the &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot; requirement.  </p>

<p>The initial implementation format for this schema will be JSON and it will be specified by the developer on a path segment heirarchical basis allowing for inheritance of specification and will hopefully later be available in a variety of formats(3). </p>

<p>FootnotesOther back-ends could include interfaces to CouchDb, Amazon&#39;s SimpleDB and S3, Flickr, YouTube, and more. Server languages to hopefully also include Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, VBScript, [http://www.java.com/en/ Java, C#, VB.NET, Cold Fusion, and more. Formats to hopefully include (X)HTML+Microformats, XML, RSS, AtomPub, YAML, and more.</p>
 summary : <p>RESTful + Admin = Restin </p>

<p>Restin is an admin application for assignmapper and Elixir models. The project is brand new (four days old as of 4/23/2007) and is a bit rough around the edges. Though it is built on Pylons, it should work on any model defined using assignmapper or Elixir Entity classes. </p>

<p>(Very) Quick StartInstallsvn checkout http://restin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Restin
<br/>cd Restin
<br/>python setup.py developSet UpBy default, Restin uses SQLite. Change that first in development.ini if necessary, then run: </p>

<p>paster setup-app development.iniLaunchpaster serve --reload development.ini
<br/># This might work, too:
<br/>./development.inPoke AroundFirst, go to http://localhost:5001/applications. Create an application entry containing metadata about an existing Pylons project. (If you don&#39;t have one, you can get super-meta and fill in the details for Restin itself.) </p>

<p>The two important fields are &#39;package name&#39; and &#39;dburi.&#39; Right now, package name refers to a Pylons package name. For example, if you use from myproject.lib.base import * in your project, you&#39;d put &#39;myproject&#39; in the package name field.  </p>

<p>Now, the navigation is somewhat lacking, so once you&#39;ve created an entry for your app, you&#39;ll have to type in the address bar before you can start administering your app&#39;s data: </p>

<p>First, click &#39;Show&#39; for the app you want to admin, then add &#39;/model&#39; to the end of the URL. This will bring up a list of the entities in the model for that app. Select an entity and start administering. </p>

<p>FutureFix the obviously broken stuff, like the things noted above.  Add authorization Deal with any potential Unicode issues Support model classes mapped in the &#39;normal&#39; way (and maybe even Table objects) by generating assignmapper classes (is this possible/feasible?) Generate Pylons (or other) apps from application metadata (!?)</p>

 title : The restler Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RESTful + Controller = Restler </p>

<p>Restler is a base controller for Pylons projects that provides a set of default RESTful actions that can be overridden as needed. </p>

<p>Quick StartThis document contains info on the bleeding edge version of Restler, 0.5.x. </p>

<p>Install PylonsRestler is developed against Pylons 1.0. </p>

<p>easy_install Pylons==1.0rc1Install Restlereasy_install RestlerOr, if you want to hack on Restler: </p>

<p>hg clone https://restler.googlecode.com/hg/ Restler
<br/>cd Restler
<br/>python setup.py developCreate a new Pylons projectpaster create --template=pylons MyProject
<br/>cd MyProjectSet up database engine, Session, and metadataNot documented here. See Pylons docs. </p>

<p>TODO: Link to appropriate docs and/or show simple example here. </p>

<p>Create a base controller classOpen myproject/lib/base.py and add the following lines below the existing imports: </p>

<p>from restler.controller import Controller as _RestControllerNext, create a new class that implements the get_db_session method: </p>

<p>class RestController(_RestController):</p>

<p>    def get_db_session(self):
<br/>        return myproject.model.meta.SessionWhere you define your database session object/factory is up to you. The example here is based on a model setup suggested by members of the Pylons community. </p>

<p>Note: The default BaseController generated by paster when creating a new Pylons project is used by the default error and template controllers, so it&#39;s probably best to leave it alone and not use it as your RESTful base controller. </p>

<p>Create some mapped entity classesEvery entity class needs member_name, member_title, collection_name, and collection_title class attributes. </p>

<p>To return JSON using the Restler controller&#39;s built-in facilities, entity classes need to define the methods to_simple_object and to_simple_collection. Restler provides an Entity base class with default implementations of these methods. </p>

<p>import restler.entity</p>

<p>class Garage(restler.entity.Entity):</p>

<p>    member_name = &#39;garage&#39;
<br/>    collection_name = &#39;garages&#39;
<br/>    member_title = &#39;Garage&#39;
<br/>    collection_title = &#39;Garages&#39;</p>

<p># TODO: Create a SQLAlchemy `Table` object for the `Garage` class and map the
<br/># class and table.Restler has a helper function that will automagically add member_name, member_title, etc. attributes to the class (only works for words with simple plurals): </p>

<p>import restler.entity</p>

<p>class Garage(restler.entity.Entity):
<br/>    pass</p>

 title : The rfcmail Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RFCMail is a collection of Perl modules which can be used to implement a number of mail-related things, such as SMTP honeypots for spam analysis. Its core business is that of an MTA, so most of the modules relate to SMTP in some way. It does not major in message text handling or message store (mailbox) management. The author has chosen to re-implement the core SMTP functionality, rather than re-use existing implementations, so as to allow much greater flexibility in how SMTP is handled. </p>

<p>At this particular point in time, it has a fully functional SMTP server which is capable of acting as an SMTP honeypot. This may prove of some interest to those conducting anti-spam research. Although much of the existing functionality is clean and well documented, the overall project is still a shambles, undergoing significant restructuring as new and better ways of structuring the code are discovered. It has not settled down into a pattern that can be released and maintained, so it is currently only suitable for ad hoc tasks, not as the basis for long-term software products. </p>

<p>The ultimate project goal is to produce a library of parts capable of implementing a fully functional mail server (MTA) with a very large degree of flexibility. This flexibility should make it possible to experiment with bleeding-edge anti-spam techniques and mail delivery protocols. Perl is well-suited as a base language for this purpose, since it allows rapid development and easy combination of modules to form a useful whole. On the other hand, the project is not expected to suit the needs of those who just need an ordinary, solid MTA that scales well (although the project owner will be quite happy if this end can be met). </p>

<p>This project also aims to set extremely high (to the point of fastidious) standards in code and documentation quality, and standards compliance. </p>

<p>This project has only just been migrated to Google Code (from origins as a private project), and a significant amount of work remains to be done before the project will be accommodating to prospective users and contributors. It also remains to be seen how much time the project owner can dedicate to this task! At the moment, the suggested way to introduce yourself to it is to check out the trunk, then read the documentation in pm/RFCMail/ESMTP/Server.pod. Also, look at bin/honeypot-smtpd.pl for a simple but useful application (which can be launched from inetd or similar if desired). Note that this application requires the well-known Net::DNS module.</p>
