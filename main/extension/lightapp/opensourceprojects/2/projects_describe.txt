<p>~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/ </p>

<p>playing with the codeI use space indentation in python (4 spaces per indent) - sorry. </p>

<p>The plugin fetches covers downloaded by cover art display plugin (most of them since I don&#39;t escape artist / album names) </p>

<p>Urgent todo: </p>

<p>mouse interaction (2xclick to play, and click to change focus) better rhythmbox signal integration smarter texture management better interpolation, slowing down during the last few covers instead of uniformly over all of them a more abstract way to fetch the textures, that can probably wait for the rhythmbox core to fully support cover art embedded in song tags</p>

 title : The rich-join-association Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of rich-join-association is to make it simpler to make use of has_many :through associations in which the join table has a single additional attribute.</p>

<p>(Example adapted from http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/articles/2006/04/20/many-to-many-dance-off)
<br/>So if you had Dancers, Movies, and Appearances and each Appearance had an attribute character_name, rather than saying:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dan = Dancer.new
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cameo = Appearance.new
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cameo.dancer = dan
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cameo.movie = Movie.find_by_name &#39;Served&#39;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cameo.character_name = &#39;Joe the Dancemaster&#39;
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dan.appearances &lt;&lt; cameo</p>

<p>One would simply enter</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dan = Dancer.new
<br/>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;s.cameos[&#39;Served&#39;] = &#39;Joe the Dancemaster&#39;</p>

<p>Currently, you can only use one join attribute per pair of classes joined, but if an Appearance also joined a Dancer to a Song with an attribute quality_of_performance, that would work as well.</p>

 summary : <p>AboutRipescript is a small interpreted language, easy to embed inside applications, or use in scripts. It is a dynamically typed language, with a simple data type model. Objects are constructed out of a primitive data type called the table, much like in Lua. Ripescript&#39;s lexer, parser and the virtual machine are designed to be simple. Features of the language include exception handling, closures and a simple object model allowing inheritance and mixins. Ripescript features an advanced building system, created around SCons, that allows one to build modules into the interpreter, or into dynamically linked libraries. </p>

<p>Planned FeaturesDynamic typing and powerful basic types, Closures, Simple and clean object model implemented with tables, but with a syntax for defining classes, Exception handling and exception hierarchy. ImplementationNothing that is usable at this time.</p>

 summary : <p>RNAs Não CodificantesA maioria das moléculas de RNAs estudadas estão relacionadas ao envio da informação genética para tradução de proteínas. Porém, descobriu-se que outros tipos de moléculas de RNA que não são traduzidas estão presentes em muitos organismos diferentes e afetam uma variedade grande de processos, são os chamados RNAs não-codificantes (ncRNAs).  </p>

<p>Apesar de sua importância funcional, os métodos biológicos e computacionais para a detecção e caracterização de RNAs não-codificantes ainda são imprecisos e incompletos. A identificação de novas espécies de ncRNAs torna-se difícil através de procedimentos experimentais ou de técnicas computationais tradicionais, pois a natureza biológica dessas moléculas ainda é pouco conhecida.  </p>

<p>O objetivo deste trabalho é obter uma ferramenta melhor para a comparação de uma seqüência de RNA não codificante contra um banco de seqüências. Tendo como base as ferramentas VIENA e Infernal, serão aplicadas técnicas inteligentes na identificação de genes de ncRNAs em seqüências gênicas com uma precisão aceitável e uma velocidade superior às ferramentas hoje disponíveis.</p>

 title : The rocket-seat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Rocket Seat is a Content Management System with one main goal, to be fully extensible so that all plugins are first class citizens. In reality, Rocket Seat is just a simple event framework, with a few other tools. Rocket Seat does intend provide events, security, caching, theming, url aliasing, and a slew of other utilities, but all user functionality from admin interfaces, to content posting, is all done through plugins. </p>

<p>With that said, Rocket Seat itself focuses on the developers first, and speed second. </p>

<p>Currently Rocket Seat is focused on getting a few of the core basics down. The more expensive design aspects, that is the event system, and the theming system. Both will be in a relative flux until a robust enough system is worked out to make progress into actual plugins, and real functionality, can be obtained.</p>

 title : The rockonfuzzytool Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RockOn Fuzzy ToolRockOn Fuzzy is an open source fuzzy control and simulation tool in Java. This project is a result of a fuzzy logic course at the University of Kassel, Germany. During our investigation on fuzzy logic we recognized that there is a very rare offer of free fuzzy logic tools. So we decided to  share our project with the internet community to help other people dealing with this topic and with the hope that some people might be interested in supporting us to develop this tool in the future. With this framework it&#39;s very easy for everybody to create own fuzzy controllers as well as test their functionality in a graphical simulation environment.  </p>

<p>Click here for the RockOn FuzzyTool Website. </p>

<p>RockOn Fuzzy consists of two basic components: </p>

<p>1. A graphical Fuzzy Control Editor.It supports: </p>

<p>Define linguistic variables by defining their name, lower an upper range, the unit and whether it is an input or output variable Define linguistic terms as part of the variables Define defuzzyfy methods Define a ruleset how to handle incoming data from the controlled system A Test Suite to control how the system reacts on concrete input values </p>

<p> </p>

<p>2. A graphical Simulation EnvironmentUsing this simulation tool its very easy to test the userdefined Fuzzy Controller under real conditions. For that purpose we used a 2d physics engine in Java, called  Phys2D. The extensible structure of the simulation code allows users to create their own simulations an integrate them in the existing framework. Just try it yourself! </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This example shows a simple simulation of a pendulum.  It uses a self defined fuzzy control which tries to balance the sphere. </p>

 title : The rox-musicbox Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FeaturesMP3, OGG, Flac, WAV support. ESD, Alsa, OSS support. Album Art display Drag and Drop adding of Songs, Directories of songs, and Playlists (m3u, pls and xml) Shuffle play (with cache so you don&#39;t replay songs too frequently). Seek control bar to zip to specific parts of any song. Volume Control Playlist filtering Translations: fr, it, es, pt_BR  </p>

<p>InstructionsExtract the MusicBox appdir and copy it to wherever you normally put ROX apps. Then launch it! Initially it assumes that you put all your mp3 and/or ogg files in ~/Music. If this is not correct you must edit the Options to suit your setup. For library changes just hit the refresh menu item, unless you used Drag and Drop in which case the display will update automatically. If you have a lot of files it will take considerable time to read them all - see below on how to speed things up. However, don&#39;t let that stop you from hitting the play button! We got threads! </p>

<p>In place of the ~/Music default library location you may enter </p>

<p>one or more directories separated by &#39;:&#39; like a path one or more .pls or .m3u files one or more .xml files (saved from MusicBox) any combination of the above. You can also leave it blank and just load files dynamically. This can be done in the following ways </p>

<p>Drag and Drop files or folders on the MusicBox main or Playlist windows Pass files or folders or playlists on the MusicBox command line. Use rpc (see below) MusicBox currently exports the following commands via rpc </p>

<p>load_songs #replace existing and start playing add_songs #append to existing play pause next prev stop Here is how to call these functions in python. Also, see the Extras directory for useful examples of this. We also support a similar set of command line options. (try: rox MusicBox -h) </p>

<p>Tag Info and FilenamesMusicBox will try to read tag info from your files, but this can take a long time and many files do not contain this information. Therefore, it will first attempt to &#39;guess&#39; the artist, album and title from the filename and path of each song. However this loading process is a background task. You can start playing songs or even quit MusicBox while this is happening. </p>

<p>The default assumption is artist/album/title.ext, but you can change this if you need to. In the Options dialog there is a Pattern field that provides a place to edit the default pattern to be used. (Note: this is easy to get wrong and if you create a pattern that fails to match properly the default will be used) Currently MusicBox only supports artist, album, title and track. </p>

<p>The default pattern looks like this </p>

<p>    ^.*/(?P.*)/(?P.*)/(?P.*)This pattern throws away any leading path, and separates the rest as artist/album/title. The </p>

<p> option is also available if you have track numbers as part of your file naming scheme. </p>

<p>MusicBox will also use Extended Attributes for tag info if available. These tags are my own creation and only are supported by my CD ripping application Ripper. Xattrs are not widely supported yet, but I believe these will be the future of metadata. Stay tuned. </p>

<p>LibrariesAfter loading a large list of songs, you can save these in a Library to speed up reloading the next time. To do this, right click on either the Main or Playlist windows and select Save. A ROX savebox will appear with Library.xml showing in the Choices (Options) folder for MusicBox. You may drag this file anywhere you want to save it and rename it if you wish. Be sure not to change the .xml extension or MusicBox will not know how to reload it. This file may now be dragged into either MusicBox window to reload those songs. MusicBox will not need to examine each file again to get the tag info - that was saved in the xml file. Loading times are much quicker this way. You can also use these files in the Options dialog as your default library instead of the path to the actual song files. You may create as many of library xml files as you wish. </p>

<p>Dependencies and OptionsMusicBox depends on the following external modules/libraries for various features. Current versions that I am developing with as of this writing are: Basics </p>

<p>ROX-Lib2 2.0.0 GTK+ 2.6.7 (req &gt;= 2.4) GLib 2.6.3 PyGtk 2.6.1 (req &gt;= 2.4) Audio output (optional if your python supports ossaudiodev or linuxaudiodev, but highly recommended) </p>

<p>libao 0.8.5 pyao 0.82 (http://www.vorbis.com) pyalsaaudio 0.2 (http://www.wilstrup.net/pyalsaaudio) MP3 (optional, but you need at least one format supported) </p>

<p>pymad 0.4.1 (http://spacepants.org/src/pymad/) libmad 0.15.1 (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/) ID3 tag support (Optional) </p>

<p>pyid3lib 0.5.1, id3lib 3.8.3 (http://pyid3lib.sourceforge.net) OGG (Optional) </p>

<p>pyogg 1.3, pyvorbis 1.3, libvorbis 1.1.0, libogg 1.1.2 (http://www.vorbis.com) FLAC (Optional) </p>

<p>libflac 1.1.2 (http://flac.sourceforge.net) pyflac 0.0.1 (included, but must be built, or you can get it from most debian sites) WAV (Standard) </p>

<p>python&#39;s built in wave module Hopefully your distro will provide packages for these, otherwise you will have to download and build them from sources.</p>

 summary : <p>rrdpy - Python RRDTool UtilitiesPython module and scripts to simplify working with RRD&#39;sby Corey GoldbergRRDtool is the Open Source industry standard, high performance data logging and graphing system for time series data.  RRD stands for &quot;Round Robin Database&quot;.  It stores data in a very compact way that will not expand over time. </p>

<p>RRDTool is a really good back-end for storing time-series data.  If you are developing tools that need a data repository and graphing capabilities, this provides you both. You create an RRD and then you begin inserting data values at regular intervals. You then call the graphing API to have a graph displayed. The neat thing about this data storage is its “round robin” nature. You define various time spans, and the granularity at which you want them stored.  A fixed binary file is created, which never grows in size over time. As you insert more data, it is inserted into each span. As results are collected, they are averaged and rolled into successive time spans. It makes a much more efficient system than using your own complex data structures, relational database, or file system storage. </p>

 title : The rs-wxpython-nooberdev Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I&#39;m currently learning GUI programming using Python and wxPython and dabbling in other things.  This is a collection of code I&#39;ve written ... </p>

<p>Files in the download section:</p>

<p>FilenameSummary rectangle.pymathematically manipulate a rectangle GravitySim.pyGravity Simulator - left click on the right grey area, values are printed out ... click again to show the &#39;animation&#39; .... has A LOT of room for improvements. noober_editor.pyBasic text editor written in python and wxPython ... like several samples ... not all features implemented at this point colorWheelBitShiftTetra.pyShifting bits in an interesting way and seeing the result in an HTML file ... toc_006.pyInitial release - starting with toc_006.py (Will be changing naming scheme).  This is the &quot;featured&quot; file </p>

<p>File Descriptions:rectangle.pyrectangle.py is a class that has various modules for finding properties of rectangles and manipulating them. </p>

<p>Things that I need to add: Add fun things like rotation, skew, translate, etc Finish making rotation more general by rotating about an arbitrary point  Minimize round-off errors Continue checking code, cleaning it up Add more fun things ... or make a new file name geometry and start on other shapes toc_006.pytoc_006.py is a program that has a directory tree, text box, and a button panel.  You select a folder, it prints out an alphanumerically sorted list with folders first then files.  You can save the file, add timestamps, and exit. </p>

<p>Things that I need to add: Improve error checking, it currently hangs on empty drives Improve options for customizing generated document Maybe add interface for changing each description GravitySim.pyGravitySim.py was my first attempt at using the DC for painting ... I was going to make it draw in real-time, but moved back to my noober_editor.py </p>

<p>Things that I need to add: Restructure code and make it so the balls drop in real time </p>

<p>noober_editor.pyBasic text editor with a palindrome test module </p>

<p>Things that I need to add:  Check to see which sections haven&#39;t been implemented and finish it Update the Save As ... function to work on the close event or at least a dialog asking to save </p>

<p>colorWheelBitShiftTetra.pyThis program shifts bits in an interesting (to me) way and displays the result in an HTML file </p>

<p>Things that I need to add: Maybe have this output to a different medium instead of HTML </p>

 title : The rtunnel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>See http://github.com/coderrr/rtunnel for latest version </p>

<p> INSTALL  </p>

<p>on server and local machine: </p>

<p>gem install rtunnel </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have root access on server, you can use either the rtunnel_server_linux binary (only works with linux), or extract the .tar.gz and use rtunnel_server.rb (all function the same) </p>

<p> USAGE  </p>

<p>on server (myserver.com): </p>

<p>rtunnel_server </p>

<p>on your local machine: </p>

<p>rtunnel_client -c myserver.com -f 4000 -t 3000 </p>

<p>This would reverse tunnel myserver.com:4000 to localhost:3000 so that if you had a web server running at port 3000 on your local machine, anyone on the internet could access it by going to http://myserver.com:4000 </p>

<p> News  </p>

<p>0.3.6 released, new protocol created gem for easier installation 0.2.1 released, minor bugfix, cmdline options change 0.2.0 released, much simpler 0.1.2 released Created rtunnel_server binary for linux so you don&#39;t need Ruby installed on the host you want to reverse tunnel from 0.1.1 released Added default control port of 19050, no longer have to specify this on client or server unless you care to change it  RTunnel?  </p>

<p>This client/server allow you to reverse tunnel traffic.  Reverse tunneling is useful if you want to run a server behind a NAT and you do not have the ability use port forwarding.  The specific reason I created this program was to reduce the pain of Facebook App development on a crappy internet connection that drops often.  ssh -R was not cutting it. </p>

<p>How does reverse tunneling work? </p>

<p>tunnel_client makes connection to tunnel_server (through NAT) tunnel_server listens on port X internet_user connects to port X on tunnel server tunnel_server uses existing connection to tunnel internet user&#39;s request back to tunnel_client tunnel_client connects to local server on port Y tunnel_client tunnels internet users connection through to local server or: </p>

<p>establish connection: tunnel_client --NAT--&gt; tunnel_server reverse tunnel: internet_user -&gt; tunnel_server --(NAT)--&gt; tunnel_client -&gt; server_running_behind_nat How is this different than normal tunneling? </p>

<p>With tunneling, usually your connections are made in the same direction you create the tunnel connection.  With reverse tunneling, you tunnel your connections the opposite direction of which you made the tunnel connection.  So you initiate the tunnel with A -&gt; B, but connections are tunneled from B -&gt; A. </p>

<p>Why not just use ssh -R? </p>

<p>The same thing can be achieved with ssh -R, why not just use it?  A lot of ssh servers don&#39;t have the GatewayPorts sshd option set up to allow you to reverse tunnel.  If you are not in control of the server and it is not setup correctly then you are SOL.  RTunnel does not require you are in control of the server.  ssh -R has other annoyances.  When your connection drops and you try to re-initiate the reverse tunnel sometimes you get an address already in use error because the old tunnel process is still laying around.  This requires you to kill the existing sshd process.  RTunnel does not have this problem.</p>

 title : The rubiq Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Rubiq will try to be as close as possible to a real Lisp, while still retaining interoperability with both Ruby and Java. The Lisp syntax will be more influenced by Common Lisp than Scheme. A few features that will be very important is correct handling of lambdas as blocks, macros, read macros and an extension mechanism that will make Ruby-Lisp interop work correctly from both sides. The core of the system will have one layer or special forms and pure Lisp methods, which then translates directly into a JRuby AST. This translation makes it possible to use features of the AST that regular Ruby code can&#39;t.</p>

The Ruboss Framework brings the design principles and productivity of Rails to Flex development, and makes integration with RESTful Rails controllers as simple as possible. </p>

<p>Getting StartedCheck out Hello Ruboss for a short introduction to the Ruboss Framework. </p>

<p>StatusThe latest milestone update (2008.05.20) has: added Rails validation support custom format (fxml) to not conflict with ActiveResource clients </p>

<p>We are in the process of closing in on the features that would constitute the first numbered beta release (as opposed to dated milestones). As soon as we have the first beta of the framework there should be a lot more documentation coming. </p>

 title : The ruby-cssparser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>An implementation of a CSS parser for Ruby. </p>

<p>This project is in its initial state and sandbox development is the only activity going on right now. This means that no fancy build system etc exists, yet. </p>

<p>The primary goal for the moment is making a functional scanner for valid CSS.</p>
 title : The ruby-datamapper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The DataMapper is an Object-Relational Mapper for Ruby. It integrates with Rails or can be used stand-alone. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Speed. Speed. Speed. The DataMapper is fast. On average, between 2 to 5 times faster than ActiveRecord under most conditions. </p>

<p>Easy on hardware. DataMapper uses less RAM than ActiveRecord, both to load the library itself, and during operation. </p>

<p>Easy on the mind. DataMapper&#39;s philosophy is that you shouldn&#39;t have to work for performance. You don&#39;t have to &quot;include&quot; associations to eager-load. Finders are ActiveRecord compatible, but they also allow for an even simpler, more terse Enumerable-like syntax.</p>

 title : The ruby-emerald Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A set of parsers including XML, CSS, JSON, RDF, RSS, Atom, GEDCOM, and hopefully more. The  parsers are designed to be optionally forgiving of errors and have methods for validation and fixing of code errors. The entire set is within the Emerald module and then each parser within its own submodule. ==Examples:== Emerald::XML::validate(str), Emerald::CSS::Selector.new(&#39;body  #fun&gt;img&#39;) This is the first Ruby project by the author and therefore may violate conventions or contain security flaws. Furthermore, Emerald only provides an abstract means of performing the tasks and would be glad to have a user-interface of some sort. Help is most welcome.</p>

 title : The ruby-fs-api Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Deprecated!This project has been deprecated. No more work will go into this project and it will no longer work after FamilyTree v1 is removed from the FamilySearch API. </p>

<p>New Projectruby-fs-stack is the project that is replacing this project. It will soon offer all of the functionality of ruby-fs-api, but is much improved. </p>

<p>http://github.com/jimmyz/ruby-fs-stack </p>

<p>ImprovementsSeveral improvements make the new ruby-fs-stack project better than this one. </p>

<p>Packaged and distributed as a gem (on gemcutter.org). Simply gem install or add as a gem dependency to your Rails project.  Based on FamilySearch generated code. FamilySearch generates code that handles all parsing and serialization to/from JSON. When FamilySearch deploys a new release, this code can be easily updated, allowing the project to stay up to date with any changes in the API.  Multiple Ruby Runtimes - ruby-fs-stack should be compatible with Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, JRuby, and Rubinius.   Modular. The ruby-fs-stack will eventually encompass all API modules offered by FamilySearch. It is being built in a modular fashion so that you can include only what you need.

 title : The ruby-hive Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project has nothing to do with Hive from MIT </p>

<p>The Hive is a distributed cluster with multiple participating machines. It is OS agnostic, and the cluster membership is dynamic. it supports a publish/subscribe paradigm with the channels serving as blackboards. </p>

<p>This cluster can be used to administer the group of participating machines or to monitor and summarize the performance characteristics of the cluster as a whole. </p>

<p>Agents are created and added to a single repository from where they migrate to machines that needs to use them. </p>

<p>The whole cluster is implemented on top of IRC protocol as it provides a convenient text based protocol that allows easy monitoring and debugging. </p>

<p>A quick tutorial and relevant information is provided here </p>

<p>The ruby-ircd daemon was developed for use in this project (and is used internally to provide the hive server). </p>

<p>This small behavioral wrapper around libxml-ruby provides graceful transformation of the content inside XML responses. </p>

<p>Three Methods to Access XML Content#content_forAn XPath-based content selector, returning the content of the first selected node. When content is found, the closure (block) is called with the content, enabling usage similar to a visitor pattern. This pattern allows your XML consumer to gracefully skip code for missing content. </p>

<p>Design goal is to provide a wrapper over REXML::Elements, where all higher level logic is applied immediately to the xml tree. Thus the xml is available at any time, and any holes in the api can be dealt with temporarily by working on the underlying xml (or where more power is needed). </p>

 summary : <p>The library&#39;s primary aim is to make the wealth of libraries on CPAN available to Ruby. It should also serve as an easier approach to glue different-language software projects, or as a language migration path. </p>

<p>It is based on Yoshidam&#39;s Perl library, with some minor updates and fixes. It builds on that work by offloading a lot of meta-magic to a Ruby script which attempts to perform introspection on Perl classes (using Devel::Symdump), and creating classes in Ruby with appropriate methods. </p>

<p>It still needs a fair bit of work, but currently you can do this kind of thing (require hacking a la ruby-python): </p>

<p>require &#39;perl&#39;
<br/>require &#39;perl/spreadsheet/parse_excel&#39;</p>

<p># put class in top-level namespace. Perl is currently a class so you can&#39;t include
<br/>Spreadsheet = Perl::Spreadsheet</p>

<p># extend perl class in ruby
<br/>class Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
<br/>  class Worksheet

 summary : <p>FeaturesPure Ruby (Using default core libraries) Simple as possible, No Feature Overkill. Safely ignores invalid RDFa statements (e.g.- Bad CURIEs, invalid URIs). Instead, the parser emits warning and debug messages to the &#39;Collector&#39; Extensible by allowing developers create their own custom &#39;Collectors&#39; to add bridge data coming from the RDFa parser to the developers&#39; own RDF stores. Has a mixin method:   require &#39;rdfa&#39;

<br/>  c = MyClass.new
<br/>  source = &#39;&#39;

<br/>  Anonymous Resources (BNodes) are placed in a custom namespace:     tag:code.google.com,2007-03-13:p/ruby-rdfa/bnode#One can override this in the parameters. 
<br/>Because RDFa uses CURIEs, we do not use QNames in the RDF statements-- everything is a URI object or literal text. About URI resolution work correctly for link and meta elements that are found in the head of an html document. Any xml document that has html as its root element, not just the ones that have the xhtml decl. Subversion commit r7 adds Nested RDFa support. Limitationsxml:base is completely ignored. Ignores Reification, but will output anonymous nodes in a special way. The RDFa Specification is still in flux, so please bear with. Nest CURIEs are not supported. Literal text are the only supported object datatype (as the content) for RDFa property statements; xml fragments are converted to a string.</p>

Theming can be implemented very easily using built in Ruby features. Vu&#39;s goal is to create a (fairly) pure Ruby toolkit that works well on all platforms and is extensible to all GUI needs, providing an easy to understand and extend API and performance comparable to lower level toolkits. Eventually, it should expose a rich set of user interface components, inter-application and inter-toolkit drag and drop/copy and paste support, eye pleasing themes with support for accessibility features and translations, all from the comfort of Ruby.</p>

<p>The library is setup to be used as a plugin to a Rails application because that is my initial use for it. However, it should be usable from other Ruby programs. </p>

<p>It&#39;s in pre-beta stages and I may significantly change the design, but is usable for the tlds currently supported (com net org biz us info and some others). As it is, feel free to create any tickets. </p>

 title : The rubybackup Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A couple of simple classes for cleansing, copying and getting directories in sync.  I&#39;m forever trying to scrub directories of bad files, test files, backups from editors that leave the ~ in the file name.  So, I just wrote a real simple directory tools class, you can use it to SCRUB, XCOPY, SYNC, or ZIP a directory and all subdirectories while avoiding a list of bad file name regular expressions that you supply.  The second class parses a YAML file full of commands into the DIR TOOLS.  This way you can automate tasks like SCRUB by directory of these file patters, XCOPY this directory to another directory, then ZIP this directory.  In this way you can string as many of these commands together into one or many YAML files. In the end, I can automate a lot of my basic file clean ups with these two simple classes.  If you find this useful, please let me know maybe I can invest more time into it, or develop a GUI, or something.</p>

You don&#39;t need to compile anything and you don&#39;t need Apple&#39;s Developer Tools (xcode) installed. </p>

<p>The Ruby One-Click Installer for OSX is adding the installed files to /usr/src, not replacing Apple&#39;s original Ruby. That means you can easily uninstall this package or switch to Apple&#39;s Ruby again. </p>

<p>Package Ingredients </p>

<p>Ruby 1.8.6 » SQLite 3.4.0 » Mongrel 1.0.1 (+dependencies) » Ruby/LDAP 0.9.7 » Ragel State Machine Compiler 5.22 » Rubygems 0.9.4 » Gem: sqlite3-ruby (1.2.1) » Gem: daemons (1.0.6) » Gem: rake (0.7.3) » If you want to install Ruby on Rails with the Ruby One-Click Installer for OSX, just type &#39;sudo gem install rails&#39; in your Terminal.app after installation. </p>

<p>The main Package comes without any documentation files, to keep the download and install-size at a minimum (the size after installation is always below 50MB). Most of the people that just want to run Ruby applications don&#39;t need that documentation files. If you need those files, please download and run the &#39;Documentation Package&#39;, which includes the complete ri and rdoc files for Ruby and the pre-installed gems.  </p>

<p>Why is RubyOSX better than any Huge 1000TB Rails-Everything-Out-Of-The-Box bloated installer? Maybe you want to deploy Ruby Applications without Rails (yes, that&#39;s also possible), say with the Camping Microframework. This Installer is small in size (both download and when installed) and can be easily uninstalled if you don&#39;t need it anymore - which won&#39;t be the case, we promise.</p>

 title : The rudoku Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NewsIt&#39;s 2009, and one of the goals I&#39;m setting for myself this year, is investigating if it&#39;s possible to apply the RETE pattern matching algorithm to rule-based sudoku solving. And if it is, implementing it. </p>

<p>...when I find the time, that is. I have a few ideas and a basic architecture worked out, but RETE is quite complex and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s suited for sudoku solving. Right now I&#39;m thinking it is, because the fact set (basically this is a list of all possible candidates for each field) changes incrementally during the solving process, which is the premise on which RETE was built. We&#39;ll see what gives! </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I&#39;m going to call it rudoku² (pronounced &quot;rudoku squared&quot;), because that looks pretty cool. </p>

<p>UPDATE: the Rudoku² project is now on GitHub. </p>

<p>OverviewRudoku is a hybrid sudoku solver with a modular architecture, written in Ruby. It supports both human-style (rule based) solving and bruteforcing techniques (using Ariadne&#39;s Thread). It exposes a rich API for the description of solving rules and bruteforcing strategies, and allows them to be implemented and plugged in easily. </p>

<p>The primary goal of Rudoku is experimentation and research; it was not designed to be fast or efficient (in fact, it isn&#39;t). </p>

<p>The terminology used to describe the algorithms largely corresponds with the one used on Sudopedia. </p>

<p>Currently implemented strategiesSolving rulesHidden single (several implementations) Direct elimination Naked subset (pair, triple, quad and generalised) Hidden subset (pair and generalised) Locked candidates: pointing &amp; claiming Almost locked pair: line &amp; square Scanning (two variations) X-Wing: several implementations, including a generalised version that encompasses locked candidates Swordfish Jellyfish Generalised fish: encompasses generalised X-Wing, Locked candidates, swordfish and jellyfish; it&#39;s also very slow ;) XY-Wing: square-line  Field selector strategiesSimple: first field with the least candidates (several implementations) Random First Last Naked subset: field that&#39;s part of a naked subset Uber: first field with the least candidates and with the smallest total number of candidates in the containing houses Minimal house: first field with the smallest total number of candidates in the containing houses Hidden: looks for &quot;almost hidden singles&quot; Candidate selector strategiesFirst Last Uber: candidate which occurs the least in the containing houses Least common: candidate which occurs the least in the entire grid Most common: candidate which occurs the most in the entire grid Hidden: looks for &quot;almost hidden singles&quot; Try itYou can try out the code by checking it out from SVN or downloading a snapshot, and running the test.rb file with </p>

<p>$ cd rudoku
<br/>$ ruby test.rbYou can tinker with its contents (or write your own testing code) to try out some other options. A few example grids and solvers are provided. The basics of the API are explained under Usage. A few other testing scripts are also available (gordon_test.rb, step_solver.rb). </p>

<p>Rudoku was developed on a Linux system, but it should run on other OSses without problems as long as a recent version of Ruby is installed. </p>

<p>UsageTo solve a grid, you will need at least the Sudoku itself and a Solver. </p>

<p>The Sudoku object can be created in several ways, but the easiest method is to use Sudoku.from_str. This takes in a string in the following format: &quot;000400100000705032032000700001080605070000020503010800008000560650803000007001000&quot; and returns the constructed object. The string is interpreted as a sequence of 9 rows, where zeros represent the empty fields. This format is often used to exchange grids in the sudoku community. </p>

<p>A Solver is an object that attempts to fill out all empty fields in a Sudoku. It consists of a ruleset (an Array of Rules), a FieldSelector and a CandidateSelector. The ruleset consists of the rules that will be applied to the sudoku, in order to eliminate candidates and, eventually, to solve it. </p>

<p>The FieldSelector and the CandidateSelector constitute the bruteforcing strategy that will be used when applying the rules doesn&#39;t eliminate any more candidates. The FieldSelector selects a field whose value will be guessed. The CandidateSelector selects a candidate from the list of remaining candidates of this field. This is the &quot;guess&quot;. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t need your Solver to support bruteforcing, you may omit the selectors when creating it. This probably means that your Solver will not be able to solve many sudokus, however. It is also possible to create a Solver with an empty ruleset; this will attempt to solve the Sudoku purely by backtracking. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>sudoku = Sudoku.from_str(&quot;708000300000201000500000000040000026300080000000100090090600004000070500000000000&quot;)
<br/>solver = Solver.new([HiddenSingle, DirectElimination, LockedCandidatesPointing], UberFieldSelector, UberCandidateSelector)
<br/>solver.solve(sudoku, true) # the second parameter enables bruteforcingIt&#39;s easy to define your own Rules and Selectors. A Rule contains a code block (logic) which eliminates candidates from the sudoku&#39;s fields with the eliminate and set methods. A FieldSelector contains a code block which selects a field. A CandidateSelector contains a code block which selects a candidate from the field. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>rule {
<br/>  id :my_rule
<br/>  name &quot;my rule&quot;
<br/>  desc &quot;this is my rule&quot;
<br/>  reason &quot;eliminated :candidate because foo is :foo&quot;
<br/>  
<br/>  logic {
<br/>    # write rule logic, using the &#39;eliminate&#39; and &#39;set&#39; methods
<br/>    # ...
<br/>    eliminate(field, candidate, :foo =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;)
<br/>  }
<br/>}</p>

<p>field_selector {
<br/>  id :my_field_selector
<br/>  name &quot;my field selector&quot;
<br/>  desc &quot;this is my field selector&quot;</p>

<p>  logic {
<br/>    # write selection logic, using &#39;select&#39;
<br/>    # ...
<br/>    select(field)
<br/>  }
<br/>}</p>

<p>candidate_selector {
<br/>  id :my_candidate_selector
<br/>  name &quot;my candidate selector&quot;
<br/>  desc &quot;this is my candidate selector&quot;</p>

<p>  logic {
<br/>    # write selection logic, using &#39;select&#39;
<br/>    # ...
<br/>    select(candidate)
<br/>  }
<br/>}You can find all currently implemented strategies in rules.rb, selectors.rb and candidate_selectors.rb. Feel free to implement more or refine the current implementations :)</p>

 title : The run-jetty-run Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Run Jetty RunRun web applications in Eclipse using this plugin&#39;s embedded Jetty distribution </p>

<p>GettingStarted explains it all.  Please see FutureDirectionsDiscussion to participate in the evolution of Run Jetty Run. </p>

<p>Why this plugin?I (Eelco) worked on JettyLauncher before, and though I liked the functionality, it was a pain to maintain. Maintaing the plugin never had much priority with me, especially not since I joined Wicket almost three years ago. I&#39;ve always felt guilty about not supporting it. I tried to get people on board to take it over, but that didn&#39;t work out unfortunately. </p>

<p>Something that I never liked about JettyLauncher was the fact that you had to have a separate install of the server on your machine. Why not have a plugin you can just install and let&#39;s you run web apps right away? </p>

<p>So, the goal of this project is to pick up where JettyLauncher dropped and provide a real easy to install and use Eclipse plugin for running web applications. I plan to keep this plugin super simple, so that the chance that I&#39;ll actually maintain it is highest :-) </p>

<p>Alternatives are plenty, and include the Eclipse WTP plugin - which nowadays is bundled with the JEE Eclipse distribution, or - like for instance wicket-examples does: just package the starter with your project or as a separate project. Oh, and if you use maven, there is mvn jetty:run. </p>

<p>Have fun! </p>

 summary : <p>We provide a DSL for the analysis of test platform execution logs of Wireless Sensor Networks. It is based on novel operators, which are provided for the analysis.  Traces are represented by sets of event. An event is an entry in the trace, represented by a tuple (hash) of key-value pairs, minimally including a node identifier and a type. The DSL is used to describe events. A log is loaded and parsed, checking basic constraints of events. Subsequently, the DSL allows for analyzing the event set created from the log and processing it.</p>
 title : The ruport Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ruby Reports (Ruport) is a free software library and toolset that is designed to make the task of building reporting applications less painful. Ruport supports data acquisition from both files and databases, and provides tools for munging and manipulating data as needed. Additionally, Ruport supports a highly extensible formatting system which can currently handle HTML, PDF, CSV and plaintext output. Other helpful utilities are continuously being extracted from real world applications.</p>
 title : The rupy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Weighing around 50KB, rupy is probably the smallest Java NIO application server in the world. </p>

<p>Rupy is inherently non-blocking asynchronous, which makes it the ideal candidate for high concurrency real-time applications pushing dynamic data. </p>

<p>Tested with acme, rupy performs on average ~1500 requests per second. To put that figure in perspective; acme doesn&#39;t use keep-alive, so that means 1500 unique TCP connections serving dynamic content per second!  </p>

<p>Thanks to NIO and an event queue to avoid selector trashing, this figure degrades gracefully under high concurrency. </p>

<p>If you want a real-world example of rupy in action head over to sprout; a simple blogger. </p>

 title : The rvideo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RVideoRVideo is a Ruby library inspects and processes video and audio files by providing an interface to free Unix tools like ffmpeg. </p>

<p>InstallingInstallation is a little involved. First, install the gem: </p>

<p>sudo gem install rvideoNext, install ffmpeg and (possibly) other related libraries. This is documented elsewhere on the web, and can be a headache. If you are on a Mac, the Macports build is reasonably good (though not perfect). Install with: </p>

<p>sudo port install ffmpegOr, for a better build (recommended), add additional video- and audio-related libraries, like this: </p>

<p>sudo port install ffmpeg +lame +libogg +vorbis +faac +faad +xvid +x264 +a52Most package management systems include a build of ffmpeg, but many include a poor build. So you may need to compile from scratch. </p>

<p>If you want to create Flash Video files, also install flvtool2: </p>

<p>sudo gem install flvtool2Once ffmpeg and RVideo are installed, you’re set. </p>

<p>The basicsfile = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file =&gt; &quot;#{FILE_PATH}/filename.mp4&quot;)
<br/>file.video_codec  # =&gt; mpeg4
<br/>file.audio_codec  # =&gt; aac
<br/>file.resolution   # =&gt; 320x240</p>

<p>command = &quot;ffmpeg -i $input_file -vcodec xvid -s $resolution$ $output_file$&quot; 
<br/>options = {
<br/>  :input_file =&gt; &quot;#{FILE_PATH}/filename.mp4&quot;, 
<br/>  :output_file =&gt; &quot;#{FILE_PATH}/processed_file.mp4&quot;,
<br/>  :resolution =&gt; &quot;640x480&quot; 
<br/>  }</p>

<p>transcoder = RVideo::Transcoder.new</p>

<p>transcoder.execute(command, options)</p>

<p>transcoder.processed.video_codec # =&gt; xvidDemonstration of usageTo inspect a file, initialize an RVideo file inspector object. See the documentation for details. </p>

<p>A few examples: </p>

<p>file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file =&gt; &quot;#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4&quot;)</p>

<p>file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:raw_response =&gt; @existing_response)</p>

<p>file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file =&gt; &quot;#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4&quot;,

<p>file.fps        # =&gt; &quot;29.97&quot; 
<br/>file.duration   # =&gt; &quot;00:05:23.4&quot; To transcode a video, initialize a Transcoder object. </p>

<p>transcoder = RVideo::Transcoder.newThen pass a command and valid options to the execute method. </p>

<p>recipe = &quot;ffmpeg -i $input_file$ -ar 22050 -ab 64 -f flv -r 29.97 -s&quot; 
<br/>recipe += &quot; $resolution$ -y $output_file$&quot;

<br/>rescue TranscoderError =&gt; e
<br/>  puts &quot;Unable to transcode file: #{e.class} - #{e.message}&quot; 
<br/>endIf the job succeeds, you can access the metadata of the input and output files with: </p>

<p>transcoder.original     # RVideo::Inspector object
<br/>transcoder.processed    # RVideo::Inspector objectEven if the file is processed, it may still have problems. RVideo will populate an errors array if the duration of the processed video differs from the duration of the original video, or if the processed file is unreadable. </p>

<p>ContributeContribute to RVideo! If you want to help out, there are a few things you can do. </p>

<p>Use, test, and submit bugs/patches We need a RVideo::Tools::Mencoder class to add mencoder support. Other tool classes would be great – On2, mp4box, Quicktime (?), etc. Submit other fixes, features, optimizations, and refactorings Read the 8 steps for fixing other people’s code and for section 8b: Submit patch to Google Groups, use the Google Group above. </p>

 title : The s-expression-interpreter-framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The S Running Log (SRL) is a cross-platform graphical running log. It runs on Windows 95 and up, Mac OS X 10.3 and up (PPC or x86), and any UNIX or UNIX clone with the X Window System. Written in Scheme (MrEd), it is portable to any platform PLT Scheme has been ported to as a native executable or interpreted code. It saves all information in ASCII s-expression-based flat files for easy portability and maintenance.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of SRL is its portability. It is easy to create a USB drive you can carry around in your pocket, plug into any computer, and use as a running log.</p>

<p>After a long hiatus, development is starting up again, with the goal being to create implementations of the most basic S2 Ajax tags: </p>

<p>  that updates a target div   that submits a form and updates a target div   that (periodically) updates a div via Ajax request </p>

<p>The replacements, conventionally prefixed with &quot;sq&quot;, allow for the trivial implementation of the most basic Ajax functionality. Whether or not this is a good idea is debatable: keeping the JavaScript separate from the markup, preferably in an external file, is a better (best) practice. It&#39;d also be straight-forward to create this functionality via JSP-based tag files, and arguably easier to maintain. </p>

 summary : <p>DescriptionS3Lib is a client library for  Amazon&#39;s Simple Storage Service. </p>

<p>StatusJava LibraryS3Lib-Java is complete and in active production use. Three Rings Design uses S3Lib-Java for the backend storage needs of their games. </p>

<p>C LibraryThe C implementation, S3Lib-C, is a work-in-progress. Finishing the library is waiting on free time, an external contribution, or sponsorship of the work. </p>

<p>Remaining tasks: </p>

<p>Implementation of S3Connection using libcurl. </p>

<p>S3PipeIncluded with S3Lib-Java is S3Pipe -- S3Pipe implements piping of streams to and from S3. This allows us to pipe the encrypted output of &#39;dump&#39; (and &#39;restore&#39;) directly to and from S3 -- We&#39;ve used this to implement offsite backups of our servers: </p>

<p>landonf:s3lib&gt; echo &quot;hello, world&quot; | s3pipe ... upload --stream helloworld
<br/>landonf:s3lib&gt; s3pipe ... download --stream helloworld
<br/>hello, world</p>
 title : The s3shell Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is a shell program which presents files on S3 as through they were on a traditional file system.  The commands used are the same or similar to Unix file commands. The idea is to keep the learning curve low by using commands people are already used to.   </p>

<p>The following commands will be available in this shell -  </p>

<p>Account setup - lsacct, rmacct, chacct, mkacct </p>

<p>Buckets - lsbucket, rmbucket, chbucket, mkbucket </p>

<p>Files (Objects) - ls, rm, cp, mkdir, rmdir, tree, chmod</p>
 summary : <p>s3sync: This is a ruby program that easily transfers directories between a local directory and an S3 bucket:prefix. It behaves somewhat, but not precisely, like the rsync program. In particular, it shares rsync&#39;s peculiar behavior that trailing slashes on the source side are meaningful. </p>

<p>s3cmd: This is a ruby program that wraps S3 operations into a simple command-line tool.  It is inspired by things like rsh3ll, #sh3ll, etc., but shares no code from them. It&#39;s meant as a companion utility to s3sync.rb but could be used on its own (provided you have read the other readme file and know how to use s3sync in theory). </p>

 summary : <p>Project GoalProvide plugins, libraries, and tools to enhance the user experience of SageTV. </p>

<p>Currently AvailableSage Recording Extender (SRE)A SageTV add on that provides real time monitoring of your live event recordings and automatically extends the recordings as needed to ensure that the entire event is recorded to its completion.  The motivation behind this package is to allow the complete recording of live sporting events - there&#39;s nothing worse than recording a game only to have the recording end in the 8th inning or overtime!  This plugin addresses the issue by monitoring the status of the event that&#39;s being recording on the Internet and extending the recording as necessary until the event is detected as being over. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Official v2.4.2 Build Released15 Feb 2010: The official v2.4.2 release of SRE is now posted for download. This is a bug fix release that fixes various time zone issues with the Vancouver 2010 Olympic ice hockey monitors. </p>

<p>Use of v2.4.x and above requires an upgrade to SageTV&#39;s commons-logging jar files.  Details on how to perform this required upgrade are available in this wiki doc. </p>

<p>Visit the project downloads section for access to the package. </p>

<p>Sage Job Queue (SJQ)A SageTV add on that provides the ability to process your SageTV media files based on any number of criteria.  For example, you can setup rules to have SJQ process your TV recordings only if the watched flag has been set in SageTV, or only if the recording is in HD and so on.  SJQ allows you to decide what to do to which recordings based on the contents of the recording as stored in SageTV. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The v3.0 stream of SJQ provides many new features.  Of significance: </p>

<p>Expose more of the underlying SageTV API to SJQ; provide direct access to many more tests Add support for processing of SageTV system messages in addition to media files Many improvements and bug fixes to the SJQ data store/database code Add ability to cancel active tasks Increase performance of task client log buffering Plus many more v2.x bugs fixed; see the .changes file for a detailed log of all changes in v3.0.0. Please take the time to read over the SJQv3 User&#39;s Guide, which will help you become familiar with all of SJQv3&#39;s new features. </p>

<p>Official v3.0.1 Builds Released17 Dec 2009: The official server and task client builds for SJQ v3.0.1 are now available for download in the project downloads section.  This is a bug fix release that fixes a major bug with the DataStore pool manager.  Under certain circumstances, worker threads can go to sleep forever and never perform their assigned tasks.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to v3.0.1 immediately! </p>

<p>Server Fixes </p>

<p>Fix &amp;nbsp;issue 104&amp;nbsp;: Properly track and replenish DataStore connections that time out; fix starvation bug with threads seeking exclusive DataStore connections </p>

<p>Task Client Fixes </p>

<p>There were no changes to the task client in this release; upgrading from v3.0.0.694 is not required, but the task client has been rebuilt with an updated version number to match the server for those who wish to keep their SJQ components in sync. </p>

<p>SageAlert: SageTV Event Notification SystemSageAlert allows you to receive notification of significant SageTV events via email, Twitter, and/or Growl. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Download the latest version from the downloads area. </p>

<p>NOTE: SageAlert replaces the previous SageTweet beta. </p>

<p>Official v1.0.2 builds released06 Mar 2010: The official v1.0.2 release of SageAlert is now available for download.  This is a minor bug fix release that addresses two issues: </p>

<p>Add ability for RPC client to set the HTTP UserAgent header when making RPC calls to the SageAlert server. Rely on commons-logging being upgraded in the base SageTV installation.  Please see the CommonsLoggingUpgrade wiki doc for instructions on how to perform this required upgrade.  SageAlert v1.0.2+ WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT PERFORMING THE commons-logging UPGRADE!  All users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.0.2.  Grab your v1.0.2 downloads from the project downloads tab.</p>

 summary : <p>Available VersionsThe latest release is Sandbox 1.6.1 for WordPress. </p>

<p>The legacy release for WP 2.0.x users is Sandbox 0.9.x. </p>

<p>If you are checking out the Sandbox, please note that \trunk releases may be unstable. The latest tagged release in the \tags folder is otherwise your best bet. </p>

<p>About the SandboxThe Sandbox is a theme for themers. It has the ability to be easily skinned, so beginners will feel comfortable styling it since they only need to know CSS. </p>

<p>More experienced designers will drool at the rich semantic markup and profusion of classes, dynamically generated by a few functions. </p>

<p>Sandbox is a lot of things: </p>

<p>Beautiful on the inside Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional Widgets friendly The basis for your GPL-licensed theme More importantly, the Sandbox can be a lot of things. </p>

<p>What began as Scott&#39;s leftovers has become an advanced, semantics-based theme. Andy added his innovative semantic class-generating functions and Scott edited it to oblivion. </p>

<p>So what can you do with the Sandbox? </p>

<p>You can just use it as-is and have a super-cool, truly minimalist theme. You can thoroughly customize it with CSS alone. You can use its functions, files, et al, as pleases you. You can use it to learn a few things about CSS, XHTML, and PHP.   The real feature of the Sandbox is its markup. The use of class-generating functions in the body, post div, and comment/trackback li elements create an exceptionally extensible foundation. </p>

<p>As Andy said, &quot;Given straightforward markup with plenty of selectors, there isn&#39;t much that can&#39;t be accomplished with CSS and a decent browser.&quot; </p>

<p>And the implementation of the hAtom and hCard microformats means we&#39;re looking forward. You might be able to improve on our markup, but, well, who wants to work that hard?</p>

 title : The sarasvati Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SarasvatiOverviewSarasvati is a workflow/bpm engine based on graph execution. It has a simple core which allows for different implementations. For example one may change the persistence mechanism (or avoid it altogether), change token representation or build additional functionality on top. </p>

<p>It currently has implementations in Haskell and Java. These are being fleshed out and will hopefully be porting it to C# and a dynamic language such as ruby, python or javascript. </p>

<p>FeaturesSimple graph execution based core Process level attributes Token attributes Efficient copy-on-write database storage of token attributes Execution history available through &#39;immutable&#39; tokens Node guards allow bypassing nodes or discarding tokens for flow control Domain specific language (GuardLang) for user understandable guards XML file format for process definitions Java implementation Hibernate backed engine for DB persistence Memory backed engine for cases where persistence is not required. Haskell implementation HDBC backed engine Memory backed engine Introduction to workflowWhat is workflow? Why graph based workflow? Getting started with Sarasvati   Getting the source code Sarasvati core concepts Why is the project named Sarasvati? </p>

<p>NewsSeptember 6, 2008 - V1.0.0-beta1 of Sarasvati release for Java. Cleaned up process definition file format somewhat, including fixing validation Added support for embedding script (such as javascript) in process definition files, to be executed when the node is executed Bug fixes September 4, 2008 - v1.0.0-alpha2 of Sarasvati released for Java. Added Adaptable interface for Nodes Removed visual components into separate project Fixed several bugs August 22, 2008 - v1.0.0-alpha1 of Sarasvati released for Java. Support for event listeners (global and per-process) Support for nested processes Standardized GraphFactory and GraphRepository Allow direct bean style setting of node attributes from XML Updated model to allow better recovery from failed node execution. Paves way for transaction boundaries. August 10, 2008 - v0.3 of Sarasvati released for Haskell.  Updates support for process states Changes library name from Sarasvati to sarasvati-haskell, for consistency. July 29, 2008 - v0.3 of Sarasvati released for Java Introduces explicit process states allowing for asynchronous process completions. Bug fixes July 24, 2008 - v0.2 of Sarasvati released for Java and Haskell This introduces process level variables. Previously variables were only allowed on tokens. There are also some minor fixes. June 29, 2008 - v0.1 of Sarasvati released for Java. June 23, 2008 - Examples for Sarasvati Haskell released. I refreshed the v0.1.0 release with some updates to the build, including a dependency on Cabal 1.4.  June 22, 2008 - v0.1 of Sarasvati released for Haskell. This is an alpha release. Documentation is incomplete. This will be the focus of release v0.2. Some Haskell example code as well the Java version should be released in the next week or so. June 12, 2008 - Java loader complete. Work on memory backed engine is also complete. June 12, 2008 - XML Process definition file format reworked. Now has XML Schema Definition rather than DTD. This is allows embedding of elements defined in other schemas.  June 2, 2008 - More documentation and packaging work on Haskell version. Once XML -&gt; Memory and XML -&gt; DB loaders are documented and packaged, should be ready for an alpha release.  May 26, 2008 - Start memory backed engine for java version. Basic engine is implemented. However,will need memory backed graph loader before this is useful or testable. May 26, 2008 - Implemented GuardLang for java version May 21, 2008 - Documenting and building out wiki pages. May 20, 2008 - Source code imported. I used svn2svn to extract two projects out of the many in my home repository.  May 18, 2008 - Project created on Google Code. Thank you to Stefan Webb, for allowing me to use the name.</p>

 summary : <p>This is the project page for skunk.web, a new and largely rewritten version of the SkunkWeb web application framework. It is written as a series of libraries, which can be used independently or from within other frameworks. </p>

<p>Highlights include: </p>

<p>skunk.cache, a useful cache for memoization. skunk.config, a configuration system which keeps configuration in Python, rather than using INI files or XML. skunk.stml, an implementation of STML (Skunk Template Markup Language).  Includes a Buffet plugin. skunk.web, WSGI applications implementing STML active pages and an MVC framework. Right now this is alpha code with incomplete test coverage and not much documentation. </p>

<p>skunk.web is available either under a New BSD License or under GPL 3.</p>

 title : The savage-beast-2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Based on the very popular Rails message forum, Beast, this is a Rails forum that implements multiple topics, posts, moderators, RSS feeds, localization, and most all the niceties you&#39;ve gotten to know on the Beast forums (beast.caboo.se). </p>

<p>The goal of the Savage Beast plugin is to get the featureful forums of Beast, without the hassle of maintaining separate Mongrels, subdomains, and User sharing that make Beast tricky to setup.   </p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to make this plugin as simple to install as any other Rails plugin, but in the more immediate goal we&#39;re aiming for is to create a version of Beast that integrates transparently with your existing site, and that can be setup in a few minutes. </p>

<p>NOTE that this version of Savage Beast was written from scratch, based off of the Beast trunk code as of January 2008.  It is designed to be Rails 2.0.x compliant.  It only circumstantially shares code with the original Savage Beast plugin (written by Jodi Showers and Nick Coyne), though their demo app was used extensively as a theoretical tool to grasp how this idea could work. </p>

 title : The scalab Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Scalab is an incoming build tool (Make, Ant, SCons, ...) written in Scala. It makes builds description very easy thanks to Scala&#39;s  rich expressiveness and the model used by Scalab. Moreover, Scalab offers different types of dependencies (soft dependencies, notably) which makes it possible to describe cycles in the build graph. Furthemore, the Scalab caching model allows to make conservative approximations (i.e. no need to clean the project since the results are always right). </p>

<p>The project is currently in stand-by. I will start working again on it at 40% and a first release is planned for the end of 2010.</p>

 title : The scalaserver Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>1. IntroductionRecently, I am learning scala, I am very interested in its actor libarary.  Actor is a very powerful method to handle concurrent connections. </p>

<p>And I want to write a simple httpd server using actors. Currently, It only serves static pages. </p>

<p>I wrote this in 435 lines of scala code, including comments. It supass lighttpd by a much faster responsive speed, really amazing. </p>

<p>2.Usage:$ scala -cp httpd.jar -Dscala.host=0.0.0.0 -Dscala.port=8000 -Dscala.htdocs=/path/doc com.ropzsu.scalaWeb.httpd 
<br/>3.Depends:You must have log4j.jar in you scala classpath. </p>

<p>4. Benchmark (scala vs lighttpd) (for small page)Note: This test is running in VMWare.
<br/>Host OS: windows XP, 2G memory, AMD 4400+ CPU
<br/>Guest OS: Redhat AS4U5, with 800M memoryA. Scalaserver 0.1 </p>

<p>Requests per second:    904.58 [#/sec] (mean)
<br/>Time per request:       1105.483 [ms] (mean)
<br/>Time per request:       1.105 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
<br/>B. lighttpd 1.4.19 </p>

<p>Requests per second:    406.52 [#/sec] (mean)
<br/>Time per request:       2459.922 [ms] (mean)
<br/>Time per request:       2.460 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)</p>

<p>Note: Although the above result seems to show that scalaserver is faster, 
<br/>but in really host, lighttpd is much faster.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s because lighttpd perform too slow IO operations in VMWare,
<br/>in real host, lighttpd can perform io in speed of light.

 summary : <p>== Schema Definition </p>

<p>A Ruby on Rails plugin for easy migration generation. Based on Auto-Migrations by PJ Hyett pjhyett@gmail.com . </p>

<p>== Usage </p>

<p>Create a copy of your schema.rb file and name it definition.rb. Now, when you need to change database schema, edit definition.rb file. Then, invoke </p>

<p>$ ruby/script generate migration  
<br/>It will generate a new migration with all differencies of definition.rb  against your current database schema! You can migrate immediately, or add some more tweaks to your migration, or something else. </p>

<p>Why is it great? Because you don&#39;t need to remember all that syntax like change_column, add_column, etc - you just modify your schema (in file definition.rb). </p>

<p>Nice bonus: migrations are automatically named (of course you may override name suggested). </p>

<p>== How to install </p>

<p>ruby script/plugin install http://schema-definition.googlecode.com/svn/tags/stable/schema-definition </p>

<p>== Todo </p>

<p>Indices are partially supported at the moment. </p>

 title : The schemafinder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Schemafinder starts up the local Mnesia and joins a schema defined at other nodes as discovered by the indicated nodefinder strategy and the indicated schemafinder group.   It also provides a mechanism for identifying and pruning mnesia nodes that are permanantly out of service. Finally it allows optional reuse of the Mnesia directory during shutdown and guards against joining with a stale schema after having been removed (which, if not guarded against, leads to undefined behavior).  </p>

<p>Combined these capabilities greatly ease administration and maintenance of Mnesia in a dynamic environment such as EC2.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, schemafinder currently does not assist in recovering from networking partitioning. </p>

 summary : <p>This is a simple implementation of the Cat programming language in Scheme.  The goal is to support the entire set of primitives and all of the semantics of Cat in a simple and easy to understand code base.  The hope is that this will encourage others to play around with the semantics of Cat, and write their own extensions -- as well as simply improve the implementation. </p>

<p>Right now it supports all of the level 0 and 1 primitives, supports the definition of recursive functions, and plays (sort-of) nicely with the PLT Scheme module system.  The short term goals are to add type inferencing and the level 2 primitives, which I consider essentially the first milestone.</p>

 title : The scipy-cluster Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>News: all of the few remaining calls to scipy have been replaced with calls to numpy. Versions 0.1.8 and above do not require scipy as a dependency. </p>

<p>IntroductionThis library provides Python functions for agglomerative clustering. Its features include </p>

<p>generating hierarchical clusters from distance matrices computing distance matrices from observation vectors computing statistics on clusters cutting linkages to generate flat clusters and visualizing clusters with dendrograms. </p>

<p>The interface is very similar to MATLAB&#39;s Statistics Toolbox API to make code easier to port from MATLAB to Python/Numpy. The core implementation of this library is in C for efficiency. </p>

<p>Setup and InstallationWindowsInstall dependenciesInstall Numpy by downloading the installer and running it. Make sure to run the installer for your version of Python (only Python versions 2.4 or 2.5 are supported). </p>

<p>If you use hcluster for plotting dendrograms, you will need matplotlib. Again, download the matplotlib installer for your version of Python. Scipy is optional. </p>

<p>Note: The few remaining calls to scipy have been replaced with numpy calls. Scipy is no longer required for hcluster. </p>

<p>Install hclusterNote: If you previously installed hcluster, remove it by going to Control Panel::Add/Remove Programs. </p>

<p>Download the installer that corresponds to your Python version. Run it. </p>

<p>OptionalInstall the IPython and pyreadline libraries for a more user-friendly console interface to  Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. Ctypes is required for Python 2.4. </p>

<p>Pypihcluster is available in the pypi index. </p>

<p>python setup.py install --prefix=/afs/qpThe --prefix option is optional and defaults to /usr/local on UNIX. </p>

<p>hcluster FunctionsThe hcluster Python library has an interface that is very similar to MATLAB&#39;s suite of hierarchical clustering functions found in the Statistics Toolbox. Some of the functions should be familiar to users of MATLAB (e.g. linkage, pdist, squareform, cophenet, inconsistent, and dendrogram). The fcluster and fclusterdata are equivalent to MATLAB&#39;s cluster and cluseterdata functions. All of the functions in this library reside in the hcluster package, which must be imported prior to using its functions. </p>

<p>Python HelpIf you are unfamiliar with python, the Python Tutorial is a good start. If you are looking for a good reference book, I highly recommend David Beazley&#39;s Python Essential Reference. It is by far the most comprehensive book I&#39;ve come across, covering most of python&#39;s functionality with a very complete index. </p>

<p>A Quick ExampleThis script imports the pdist, linkage, and dendrogram functions. It then generates 10 random 100-dimensional observation vectors (with pdist), hierarchically clusters them (with linkage), and visualizes the result (with dendrogram). </p>

<p>from hcluster import pdist, linkage, dendrogram
<br/>import numpy
<br/>from numpy.random import rand</p>

<p>X = rand(10,100)
<br/>X[0:5,:] *= 2
<br/>Y = pdist(X)
<br/>Z = linkage(Y)
<br/>dendrogram(Z)

<p>Check Wiki for:BenchMark for speed comparison between SCons and MMP building. Parameters for information about possible command line arguments. Installing for installation instructions ExampleProject for... example project. What is SCons?From SCons FAQ: </p>

<p>SCons is a software construction tool--that is, a superior 
<br/>alternative to the classic &quot;Make&quot; build tool that we all  
<br/>know and love. </p>

<p>With SCons, MMP files are replaced with Python scripts. No more limiting &#39;#ifdef THIS&#39; preprocessor stuff. Now you have the power of Python to create your project. But you don&#39;t have to recreate your project from scratch: MMP import is supported. </p>

<p>Have you noticed that resources are not always updated when they should. Well, I have. No worries here anymore. No need for &#39;abld reallyclean&#39; all the time. SCons produces more reliable builds by using a checksum to check if files have changed instead of only looking at the time of change.  </p>

<p>SCons also supports parallel compiling out-of-the-box speeding up compiling process over 2x and it&#39;s faster even without parallel compiling. See the BenchMark. And do you hate listing all those .cpp files you need to build? Use Python&#39;s glob module instead. See SCons homepage for more info. </p>

 summary : <p>Scoundrel?Scoundrel sneaks in behind Fink&#39;s back, rolls him, and puts presents in his coat pockets.  </p>

<p>Scoundrel builds on Fink&#39;s broad base of software packages for the Mac, and provides a way to access supplemental repositories of packages.  The hope is to provide a mechanism to reach newer, less tested software easily so that it can be proven and contributed back to the FinkProject.  There certainly are other uses for extra package repositories, but that&#39;s left to the reader... </p>

<p>Why?Mainly, it grew out of my desire to have a very up-to-date set of libraries and applications around ruby and and RubyOnRails development for the Mac, without necessarily going through the approval process to update the packages in Fink proper.  Fink package maintainers have a tough balance to reach between providing new, relevant software but also maintaining a stable environment for the users.  I don&#39;t have that problem, my packages are free to break other packages, replace packages, or run a muck in a myriad of possible ways.  I really hope they don&#39;t, but it&#39;s certainly a possibility without the benefit of a stringent testing process. </p>

<p>I also feel that there are times when it&#39;s convenient to package software that potentially you can&#39;t share with the outside world.  Maybe it&#39;s that third-party application you and your work cohorts depend on, but it&#39;s 11-thousand steps to get it setup right.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to just  fink install third-party-app-from-hell  ?? Of course it would, but you certainly can&#39;t share your buildfile containing your companies&#39; license, etc.</p>

 title : The scrat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SimulationCraft is an advanced simulation software for exploring combat mechanics of a popular MMO RPG World of Warcraft (tm). Swift release of updates, fine-grained control over simulation parameters, awesome performance and easy-to-customize architecture had made it a de-facto standard for game analysis at several game communities, e.g Shadowpriest Community or Elitist Jerks. </p>

<p>Using SimulationCraft allows to free one&#39;s mind from extensive mathematical calculations and focus completely on the problem domain. Be it a simple DPS research or an advanced modelling of not yet introduced gameplay aspect, SimCraft is an unrivaled tool for quick and precise acquiring of target raid parameters.  </p>

<p>Usually researches of game mechanics, e.g. determining scaling of a spec under different conditions, involve multiple (if not dozens) runs of SimCraft. Results of every run have to be manually processed, and, typically, put into a spreadsheet for further calculations or graph construction. This is a very monotonous and tiresome work that is quite time-consuming and error-prone (e.g. previously mentioned research involves running 4 different versions of SimCraft against 5 slightly different configurations, extracting dps values from 20 result values, putting them into a spreadsheet that will build the fancy graph). </p>

<p>Scrat alleviates this problem by automatizing input file changes, output file parsing and spreadsheet generation using several techniques (Concept). Using Scrat starts from writing a script (SampleInput) that is later transformed into a target operating system batch file, that will invoke SimCraft necessary number of times against defined input configurations. Scrat also allows to easily extract arbitrary output parameters from different result files and then render them into a spreadsheet.  </p>

<p>Target platform of Scrat is Windows and Microsoft .NET Framework of versions 3.5 and higher, releases for Linux platform are planned only after final release for Windows. </p>

<p>During quite a long period time in World of Warcraft: Wrath of Lich King beta the forum thread Shadowpriest.com Scaling Concerns Project maintained by the author contained the most up-to-date results regarding shadowpriests&#39; scaling and dps. However, staying updated comes at a cost - keeping multiple graphs and datas synced with beta servers was an annoying time-consuming task. To save time spent on running, publishing, adjusting and rerunning gameplay mechanics tests author implemented a quick and dirty version of Scrat (ProofOfConcept). </p>

<p>Despite of being not very reusable and rather clumsy by design this software allowed to test the Concept in real world circumstances. In short, point still stands - Scrat is very useful for a researcher. Additionally, necessity to quickly prepare and adjust dps/scaling reports revealed another perspective sphere of automation - autogenerating wiki reports according to pre-defined templates and simulation results (WikiGen).</p>

 title : The scrumbox Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>At our company we do all our projects using Scrum. Scrum is an iterative incremental process of software development commonly used with agile software development. A lot of projects use for example JIRA for their issue tracking. JIRA just isn&#39;t the best tool when you work with Scrum. Don&#39;t get me wrong, JIRA is a great tool, just not the tool for the job. There are some JIRA plugins to generate burndown charts or scrumboards, they make life al little easyer. You can do lots of tricks like using versions for sprints or backlogs. But what about Epics or Themes?  There are some other great software products out there build entirely around scrum, but they all are way to expensive (500$ per user/per year whoa!).  </p>

<p>So we decided to build our own tool, totally open source. This tool is going to be build in java and flex. The focus is to make the GUI as fast and intuitive as possible. Making use of flex&#39;s capabilities like dragging and dropping issues from the project backlog to a sprint backlog, or prioritizing the backlog by drag and drop. Also changing the state of an issue should be as simple as looking at the scrumboard and dragging and dropping it from the &#39;in progress&#39; column to the &#39;resolved&#39; column.  </p>

<p>Anybody interesting in committing to this project should contact me.. </p>

<p>Project architecture: The backend will be build in java. Using Spring as IoC container and hibernate as ORM layer. As database we will use MySQL. Everything will be programmed TDD style using JUnit4 and EasyMock. We add a security layer with Spring security and build our project with ant. </p>

<p>The frontend will be build in flex. Using Prana as IoC container. Later there might also be an AIR version (for offline work). We also built this project with ant.</p>

 summary : <p>This project contains the source code snippets and sample application for the book Seam in Action, authored by Dan Allen and published by Manning Publications. </p>

<p>The sample application for Seam in Action is named Open 18. The application serves as a golf course directory and golfer community site. For instructions on how to get the application and development environment setup, see the GettingStarted page. </p>

<p>The application is progressively improved and expanded throughout the course of the book. Accordingly, the source code is partitioned in stages such that you can get a snapshot of the application as it stands at the end of each chapter. By following this strategy, it allows you to either work incrementally as you progress through the book or it gives you a convenient starting point</p>
 summary : <p>This behaviour allows Cake developers to make a model fulltext searchable, meaning that the user will be able to perform mysql fulltext search (which powers Wikimedia for example) on the models. </p>

<p>For example, a fulltext search allows end users to use boolean expressions (eg. &#39;-&#39; to exclude a term) or natural language search which interprets the search string as a phrase in natural human language. </p>

<p>SetupTo setup this behaviour you will need to create the following MySQL table </p>

<p>CREATE TABLE `search_index` (
<br/>	`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
<br/>	`association_key` varchar(36) NOT NULL,
<br/>	`model` varchar(128) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,

 title : The secure-action-plugin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>secure_action is a ruby on rails plugin which makes it easy to defend your site against assumed logged in attacks, also called CSRF(cross site request forgery) attacks. </p>

<p>In an assumed logged in attack, a malicious site assumes the visitor is logged into a target site. The malicious site crafts a URL to a destructive action on the target site (change email, delete account, etc) and opens the URL to that action in a hidden iframe.  The browser then sends the user&#39;s cookies and actions may be performed on their behalf without them ever knowing.  This technique may be used to steal accounts, or perform other malicious actions to sites which allow users to log in. </p>

<p>This plugin prevents these attacks by signing forms and URLs for specified actions with the user&#39;s session_id.  By signing with the session_id, your site can be sure that the user of the browser generated the form or URL submitted. Signatures are verified before secure actions are executed. </p>

<p>To install, check out the code in your RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/ directory and follow the instructions in the README. 0.1 version of the plugin requires Rails &gt;= 1.2 </p>

 summary : <p>This extension provides an extension to Radiant to secure pages within the content management system.</p>
 summary : <p>Basically, there&#39;s only one pure java library that&#39;s typically used for ssh tasks, jsch. However, the api for scp transfers in jsch requires a bit of work messing with the input and output streams and working with the ssh protocol.  Clients just want to make a couple of method calls.  So I wrote this facade for easy scp&#39;ing and am extending it to support other ssh utilities.     </p>

<p>As a basis of comparison, here&#39;s the example file jsch provides: http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/examples/ScpTo.java </p>

<p>This code basically wraps that behavior behind a simple interface.  Compare the code you&#39;d have to write in the link above to the snippet below.  </p>

<br/>    String username = &quot;joe&quot;;
<br/>    String password = &quot;password&quot;;

 title : The semantic-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Semantic Engine is a C++ library that can be used to develop expanded-recall search engines. Using graph theory, a model is created of a text collection which can be used to find relevant documents that may not contain any keyword matches. This software can also quickly identify clusters of similar results and be used to create visual representations of document similarity. </p>

<p>The code currently supports two types of database storage engines: MySQL and SQLite. Some sample desktop programs written with Qt are included, as are Perl bindings to the C++ code. The code relies heavily on the Boost C++ libraries.</p>
 title : The semanticattributes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>ProblemAttributes in ActiveRecord have no semantic meaning. Validations only describe what to do with a field, not what the field means. But if you know what the field means, then you (and other plugins) can easily infer what to do! So the built-in validations are really tackling the problem backwards. </p>

<p>SolutionAllow the developer to create meaning for ActiveRecord attributes by assigning Predicates in a natural, declarative syntax. Allow the developer (and other plugins) to reflect on predicates and intelligently adapt behavior. </p>

<p>Now that attributes have high-level semantic meaning, you can get other bonus behavior like machine/human formats. Your code needs to deal with normalized or code-like values, but humans need to see something readable. For common patterns (like phone numbers) SemanticAttributes can handle this for you automatically. </p>

<p>Example  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>    name_is_required
<br/>    email_is_required
<br/>    email_is_an_email :with_mx_record =&gt; true
<br/>    home_page_is_a_url :domains =&gt; [&#39;com&#39;, &#39;net&#39;, &#39;org&#39;], :allow_ip_address =&gt; false
<br/>    mobile_is_a_phone_number
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  &gt;&gt; User.name_is_required?
<br/>  =&gt; true
<br/>  &gt;&gt; User.mobile_is_required?
<br/>  =&gt; false
<br/>  &gt;&gt; User.semantic_attributes[:home_page].get(:url).domains
<br/>  =&gt; [&#39;com&#39;, &#39;net&#39;, &#39;org&#39;]
<br/>  &gt;&gt; user = User.new
<br/>  &gt;&gt; user.mobile = &#39;222 333.4444&#39;
<br/>  &gt;&gt; user.mobile
<br/>  =&gt; &#39;+12223334444&#39;
<br/>  &gt;&gt; user.mobile_for_human
<br/>  =&gt; &#39;(222) 333-4444&#39;StatusStable, but not ready for public release. It needs to be used by more people than myself before I&#39;m comfortable calling it done. </p>

 title : The semanticflash Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Genius + Eye Candy = Semantic Flash </p>

<p>Boost your Flash/Flex/AIR apps with free data from the Semantic Web! </p>

<p>AboutThis project is in incubation state ( no public releases yet ). </p>

<p>Please join the discussion group to participate: SemanticFlash@Google Groups </p>

<p>The basic I/O framework ( RDF-XML ) is working and the original version of this project ( owned by univrz consulting ) is being used in commercial applications. However, for time constraints, we are not releasing anything to the public yet. </p>

<p>MissionOur main objective is to bring the power of the Semantic Web to the Flex guys. Not Flex to the Semantic Web guys ( the former implies the latter, anyway ). </p>

<p>This means that we will avoid philosophic and overly technical discussions when possible, stick to pragmatism and aim to simplify the UI developer&#39;s workflow by providing: </p>

<p>High level tools that incorporate the latest standards, conventions and best practices Articles and tutorials on how to use these tools to make your applications look better, work better and provide more value to your users A responsive community that contains a high concentration of talent from both worlds </p>

<p>You won&#39;t have to understand how the Semantic Web works, just hop in and use what&#39;s good for you. This is a grassroots approach to creating Next Generation User Interface culture and increasing the demand for RDF data ( which will most probably impact its availability in a positive way ). </p>

<p>We will feed the virtuous cycle from the other end. From the UI. </p>

<p>What&#39;s in this for me?Well, that depends on who you are. </p>

<p>If you are a Flash/Flex developer...then this framework will allow you to </p>

<p>Spice up your apps with free, high quality data from the Semantic Web ( yes, it&#39;s already here ) Slurp in artist and track data for your new Mp3 player ( from musicbrainz ) Slurp in geographical data for your new map mashup Slurp in ( whatever ) from ( take a look at some of the currently available sources ) Create highly flexible UIs for all sorts heterogeneous data ( your company&#39;s assets, for example ) Learn to speak and think in terms of the future Web Discover an excellent alternative to moving your data around as XML docs or RPC calls If you are a Semantic Web developer / researcher...then this framework will allow you to start experimenting with a highly flexible and practical development environment ( Adobe Flex ), with superb graphical and multimedia capabilities. </p>

<p>You can then set off to take the Semantic Web browser to a whole new level, explore novel filtering and navigation paradigms for the Giant Global Graph, create dazzling visualizations and mashups for your linked data and ( hopefully ) give us a hand. </p>

<p>The Semantic Web community has been working hard on delivering usable Browsers to navigate the web of data. We encourage you to stand on the shoulders on these giants and aim to improve their usability and aesthetics. </p>

<p>The following list contains remarkable examples of Semantic Web browsers: Zitgist Data Viewer, Disco, Tabulator, OpenLink&#39;s Linked Data Viewer, Marbles, etc ( you can find an extensive list here ). </p>

<p>However, we also encourage you to depart from this first generation and explore radical and novel approaches to delivering data ( click here to get your creative juices flowing ). </p>

<p>Note: Flash and Flex are now mostly opensource technologies. In fact, a branch of the runtime has been handed to the Mozilla foundation. So... no lock-in FUD, please. And if you are a futurist, then you might be relieved to meet the OpenScreen project </p>

<p>Sponsors( want to see your name here? we do!... talk to Aldo ) </p>

<p>StrategySimple things should be simple, complex things should be possible </p>

<p>What&#39;s Simple?Loading, parsing and consuming an RDF document Using RDF data at a script level ( a la E4X ) Using RDF data in the UI This includes binding / collections API integration Aggregating a few RDF documents ( how much is &quot;a few?&quot; ) These are primary goals. We will emphasize in creating services to achieve these tasks using a simple workflow and enforcing best practices whenever possible ( shielding you from the complexity of choice ). </p>

<p>What&#39;s Complex?Inference &amp; Smushing Rules Provenance Management Consuming non-static sources ( SPARQL endpoints ) Ontological Constraints Read-write RDF SPARQL Update Open, edit, save RDF docs etc... These are secondary goals. The framework should allow you to achieve these tasks by providing the basic building blocks or clear extension points. </p>

<p>RoadmapWork on CoreDesignIssues Define Model classes ( RDF Abstract Concepts ) RDF I/O Framework ( Parsers ) RDFXMLParser N3 Parser ( or just TTL? ) ... In memory storage Simple smushing Simple Forward Chaining inference ( for foaf sha1&#39;s and other necessary stuff ) AIR ( sqlite triple storage ) ...</p>
 title : The semanticvectors Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Semantic Vectors PackageSemantic Vector indexes, created by applying a Random Projection algorithm to term-document matrices created using Apache Lucene. The package was created as part of a project by the University of Pittsburgh Office of Technology Management, to explore the potential for automatically matching related concepts in the technology management domain, e.g., mapping new technologies to potentatially interested licensors. This project can be found at http://real.hsls.pitt.edu. </p>

<p>The package creates a WordSpace model, of the kind developed by Stanford University&#39;s Infomap Project and other researchers during the 1990s and early 2000s. Such models are designed to represent words and documents in terms of underlying concepts, and as such can be used for many semantic (concept-aware) matching tasks such as automatic thesaurus generation, knowledge representation, and concept matching.  </p>

<p>The Semantic Vectors package uses a Random Projection algorithm, a form of automatic semantic analysis, similar to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and its variants like Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). However, unlike other methods, Random Projection does not rely on the use of computationally intensive matrix decomposition algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This makes Random Projection a much more scalable technique in practice. Our application of Random Projection for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is descended from Pentti Kanerva&#39;s work on Sparse Distributed Memory, which in semantic analysis and text mining, this method has also been called Random Indexing. A growing number of researchers have applied Random Projection to NLP tasks, demonstrating: </p>

<p>Semantic performance comparable with other forms of Latent Semantic Analysis. Significant computational performance advantages in creating and maintaining models. DocumentationJava API Documentation is at http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html. Installation help can be found in the InstallationInstructions. Help on using SemanticVectors for DocumentSearch. A page with links to more RelatedResearch. The package requires Apache Ant and Apache Lucene to have been installed, and the Lucene classes must be available in your CLASSPATH. </p>

<p>User GroupIssues and bugs can be posted using the Issues tab above. More general questions and discussions may be posted at the group webpage, http://groups.google.com/group/semanticvectors. </p>

<p>Originally written by Dominic Widdows, in collaboration with Kathleen Ferraro and the University of Pittsburgh. The project is now maintained and extended by a small group of developers, as listed in the SemanticVectors AUTHORS file. </p>

 title : The setupx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SetupX (open technology platform) New version of SetupX is about to be released in the next couple of days.  The CVS contains the latest development! If you want to run the last final and stable version checkout Version 421. </p>

<p>svn checkout -r421 http://setupx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ setupx-read-only SetupXSetupX is a system that enables investigators to detail and set up a biological experiments. </p>

<p>workflow of the systemSetupX has various functionalities allowing the users to run the experiments and samples smoothly and fast in the lab. In order to give you an impression here is a “typical workflow” of how a sample “travels” through the lab. </p>

<p>First of all the user that is interested in running the samples contacts the PI running the lab equipped with a SetupX system. This will allow them to detail questions about the experiment. Then a user account is created for the new collaborator. Using this account the collaborator logs into SetupX and starts defining the experiment – this has not to be done in one step and just by a single user. An experiment can be modified until the first sample is actually being run on the machine. By sharing the experiment with other researchers certain information can be entered by different people. For example information of the harvest can be more easily detailed by a certain group of researchers who actually did the harvesting while the preparation of the samples can better be detailed by others. The main goal is to have a complete description of the experiment.  </p>

<p>After the definition is completed the samples that are labeled with IDs identical to the IDs in the system can be shipped to the lab running the samples. In order to avoid mixing up samples SetupX comes with a label printing software to create chemical and heat resistant labels that can be place right on the vials. </p>

<p>By the time the samples arrive in the lab the operator in the lab checks for completeness of the samples. After storing the samples in the freezer the operator enters this information in SetupX in order to make sure that everyone knows how many samples are waiting in which freezer and also since when the samples are waiting to be analyzed.  After the lab operator prepares the samples the information is updated in SetupX again. This continuous tracking allows the users to have a real time view of the lab and its progress. </p>

<p>Next step will be the actual analysis on the GC. Therefore the lab GC operator selects the samples that are going to be run in a menu in SetupX and creates a sequence for the GC. Quality controls, Reagent blanks, Method blanks are automatically added and the samples are randomized. </p>

<p>While the samples are running on the GC the status information of each samples is constantly updated. By the time all samples are completed the data can be taken from SetupX and be sent to connected annotation software.  The created result files are available and can be downloaded through SetupX as soon as the annotation software completes the calculation. </p>

<p>Every user that has access to this experiment can now download and use the acquired data. In order to make the data publicly available the system allows the administrator to curate the data received from the annotation software. The curated data is then uploaded back into the system through a wizard. From then on the data is publicly available.  </p>

<p>Installation(part of the installation documentation) </p>

<p>Setup SetupXThe entire installation of SetupX is distributed via subversion. The Subversion repository contains the most recent stable version of SetupX. In addition you can different prepared installations as ISO images or images for a vmware. </p>

<p>Downloading the newest releaseIn order to keep your installation up to date the sources are kept in a Subversion repository – it contains the latest version – make sure that your system is kept up to date by refreshing the sources from time to time. </p>

<p>SVNCheck every required data out from the repository by running (it requires that the folder /usr/share/setupx does exist already) </p>

<p>svn checkout http://setupx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ /usr/share/setupx </p>

<p>This will get you a local copy of all files required to run your version of SetupX including all required ontologies and taxonomies.  </p>

 title : The sexy-nested-resources Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Sexy Nested ResourcesInstallationscript/plugin install http://sexy-nested-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sexy_nested_resourcesDetermination of parent resourcesThis plugin adds the ability to determine the parent resource types. AbstractRequest, ActionController and ActionView all have a method called parent_resource_types(). </p>

<p>Given this routing table: </p>

<p>  map.resources :changes
<br/>  map.resources :products do |products|
<br/>    products.resources :releases do |releases|
<br/>      releases.resources :changes
<br/>    end
<br/>  endparent_resource_types() will return [:product, :release] for /products/:product_id/releases/:release_id/changes and [] for /changes </p>

<p>Sexy Context Sensitive url_helpersThe most significant feature of of this plugin is context sensitive url_helpers. </p>

<p>Given this routing table </p>

<p>  map.resources :changes</p>

<p>  map.resources :releases do |releases|
<br/>    releases.resources :changes
<br/>  end</p>

<p>  map.resources :products do |products|
<br/>    products.resources :releases do |releases|
<br/>      releases.resources :changes
<br/>    end
<br/>  endThe helper changes_path will return /changes, /releases/:release_id/changes or /products/:product_id/releases/:release_id/changes depending on the context the helper is called in. </p>

<p>The context is defined by return value of parent_resource_types(). </p>

<p>ex: </p>

<p>  if: parent_resource_types =&gt; []                   then: changes_path =&gt; &quot;/changes&quot;
<br/>  if: parent_resource_types =&gt; [:release]           then: changes_path =&gt; &quot;/releases/:release_id/changes&quot;
<br/>  if: parent_resource_types =&gt; [:product, :release] then: changes_path =&gt; &quot;/products/:product_id/releases/:release_id/changes&quot;Preloading Parent ResourcesThe plugin also adds a before filter which loads all the parent resources and assigns them to your controller. </p>

<p>To activate this functionality simply add the preload_parent_resources() call in any controller. When you activated the preloader a parent resource called Project will be a assigned to the @project attribute. The last parent resource will also be assigned to the @parent_resource attribute. </p>

<p>This method also accepts an option hash used for the before_filter. </p>

 title : The shaderman Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The initial ShaderMan was a visual Renderman shader building tool, made in spirit of ShadeTree, Slim and XSI - a free software package I&#39;ve prepared for Renderman community.  </p>

<p>But it has it&#39;s obvious problems: </p>

<p>Delphi codebase restricted the porting to Linux - and it was the most wanted new feature. I haven&#39;t really touched that code since December 2003.  Even thought ShaderMan was extensible behind the original Renderman SL code generation, in practice it was almost impossible to do since lots of stuff was just hardcoded. Thus ShaderMan.Next was born with a different set of features and goals: </p>

<p>Easily extensible. Whenever it&#39;s Renderman SL, Cg, GLSL, Python, C++, scene graph, particle system, Unix shell or a UI for a scientific data flow system - it&#39;s easy to implement or already implemented. Portable between Windows, Linux and Mac OS X from the very beginning. New nice code. Yes, it&#39;s a complete rewrite using the different programming language - but it really makes it graspable. It&#39;s only 2k 2.2k lines! </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You can download the stable build using the link at your right, or just get the most recent source code snapshot at http://shaderman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. </p>

 title : The shadint Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project Shadint was formed in August, by Shadowbot, Adi12 and idNt. We started working on a preprocessing task, that would take you to the maximum level with either grinding, or in the future, questing. We made alot of progress since the creation, and it went pretty fast aswell. Now we are mixing the preprocessing with the Load{} function, and it works very well. </p>

<p>Shadint was made with the intension to focus on the Alliance race. We have decided it would be better for our fellow Horde-gliders to create a nice chunk of tasks for them aswell. So this is for everyone who wishes to securely level a character to 80. </p>

<p>We guarantee you that we will deliver you a Task of high quality. We develop a task, test it, and go on with developing, to prevent most of the bugs. </p>

<p>The Grinding task costs nothing but a &#39;thank you&#39; we&#39;d say :&gt;. We release this task for free, meaning you won&#39;t have to give anything in return. However, reporting found bugs etc. is highly appreciated. </p>

 title : The shape2ge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>shape2geWhat is it?shape2ge is a set of two applications to convert ESRI ShapeFiles into Google Earth KML files. shape2ge consists of a frontend and an engine. </p>

<p>shape2ge-engine.py is a batchable converter engine that does the actual conversion. It reads conversion options from a XML config file generated by shape2ge-frontend.py or other methods. shape2ge-frontend.py is a CLI-based frontend that helps you generate the conversion options used by the engine. This allows you set scales and offsets (from shapefile coords to earth coords), and also to assign different display styles to different feature types. Why another one?There are a few similar programs on the web. The nicest one is called &quot;Shape2Earth&quot; and has a very nice GUI with stacks of options. Other projects like shp2kml are also available </p>

<p>The problem with the above is that they don&#39;t script or batch well. With shape2ge it is possible to generate one config file for a whole class of shapefiles and then to convert all the shapefiles in a script using the same config file. </p>

<p>For example, I have ~3000 shapefiles containing 20m contour data for South Africa. With shape2ge I can generate one config file for the whole set and then batch convert the whole lot (with some help from bash). </p>

<p>ScreenshotsThese screenshots show the result of a shapefile to kml conversion by shape2ge, they do not show shape2ge itself. The application in the screenshots is Google Earth. </p>

 summary : <p>ShapeLogic JavaToolkit for declarative programming, image processing and computer vision. </p>

<p>The first real application for ShapeLogic is a particle analyzer. It will find and categorize particles on a relatively uniform background then make a report of geometric properties for each of the particles. The main application is for recognizing cells in medical image processing. </p>

<p>Join the ShapeLogic mailing list for announcements, questions, bug reports, suggestions and feature requests. </p>

<p>The first ShapeLogic implementation is in Java. ShapeLogic C++  was started in September 2008. </p>

<p>Starting in ShapeLogic 1.5 the rules for OCR and particle categorization, can either be handwritten or generated by machine learning. The first machine learning technique in ShapeLogic is a multi-layer feed forward neural network that is trained externally but run internally. </p>

<p>Main ideas and motivation for ShapeLogicShapeLogic is a library for </p>

<p>Declarative programming and lazy computations in Java Image processing and computer vision Particle analyzer for medical image processing While ShapeLogic&#39;s declarative programming system was initially developed  for image processing and computer vision, it is widely applicable. It is currently difficult to combine declarative programming and image processing. ShapeLogic is intended as basic plumbing software that turns a logic engine  into a simple plugin component to ease entry into vision and image  analysis. ShapeLogic also fills gaps missing from current Java image  processing libraries, and uses a commercially friendly license. </p>

<p>ShapeLogic has an automatic color particle counter and analyzer and a letter matching example. </p>

<p>FeaturesDeclarative goal driven logic engine with lazy computations Specialized for the domain of image processing and computer vision The user can store rules in either a flat file or database, decreasing user reliance on Java programming User rules is written in Java or Java 6 Scripting using: Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby Implementation of 2D geometry primitives, vectorization and segmentation Annotations of point as: Different type of junctions, end point, hard or soft point Annotations of lines as: Straight, curved, concave, inflection It is free (as in free speech and free beer) Commercially friendly MIT open source license Programmed in Java Can be used as a plugin for I ImageJ, the leading Java open source project used in medical image processing Particle analyzerShapeLogic 1.2 contains the first version of a color particle analyzer.    Here is an example particle image embryos.jpg </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>To run it from ImageJ select &quot;Color Particle Analyzer&quot; in the ShapeLogic menu: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>First a particle count dialog is displayed: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Here is the result of running the non-customized particle analyzer on it. This is written to a result table that can be exported to Excel: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The categories for the particles are only examples, it is easy to setup different rules for categorizing particles. </p>

<p>In ShapeLogic 1.3 there will be custom rules to categorize specific cells and it will be tested further. </p>

<p>ShapeLogic 1.2 also contains the second version of a color particle counter. It also prints a smaller report of the particle&#39;s properties. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The test cases are taken from the sample images from ImageJ </p>

<p>Here are the Release notes. </p>

<p>How to join the ShapeLogic Team. </p>

<p>RequirementsFor running as a library for functional and declarative programming there are no requirements. </p>

<p>For running as a ImageJ plugin ShapeLogic uses the following libraries: </p>

<p>ImageJ ShapeLogic is build on top of the popular ImageJ framework, but could work stand alone without too much work Commons math: Math library used for geometry processing Antlr: For parsing build in filter language </p>

<p>You can run all current image processing algorithms outside ImageJ, using just a BufferedImage. If you want to embed ShapeLogic in your application. </p>

<p>Optional RequirementsThese are used in unit tests, builds or old versions of image processing functionalities: </p>

<p>Maven 2: Build system Apache commons: JEXL, beanutils: For first version logic rules interpreter Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby: For second version logic rules interpreter Hibernate or JDBC: For database access Google Guice: Lightweight IoC framework HSQLDB or H2: Embedded databases </p>

<p>Development Status: BetaShapeLogic is in Beta, as of version 1.0. The API is still under development. Contains a framework for declarative and functional programming. ShapeLogic currently consists of 34,000 lines of Java code including 540 unit tests. ShapeLogic has project website http://www.shapelogic.org. News2009/05/14 ShapeLogic 1.6 improve neural network and rulesExtend Multi-layer feed forward neural network to work with letter matcher Load neural network from categorizer setup file Load categorizer rules from categorizer setup file Load columns for result table from categorizer setup file 2009/04/09 ShapeLogic 1.5 machine learning releasedStart combining machine learning and declarative programming Multi-layer feed forward neural network with external learning, can be used with color particle analyzer Make it easier to select which particle properties to print out 2008/11/28 ShapeLogic 1.4 releasedAdded mask option to particle analyzer Write out information about points and lines in vectorizer working on skeletonized image In Color Particle Analyzer write out average color in R, G and B channels, to handle particles in co-localization images better   Improve the color replacer plugin, to take separate RGB values as input Change annotation of points and lines to be on individual images instead of global Improved stability of particle analyzer Improved stability of lazy stream library: fixed bugs and added unit tests Built for JDK 1.5 / Java 5 so it should work on the Mac without updates 2008/09/03 Start of experimental port from Java to C++   An experimental port of ShapeLogic to C++ has begun. The algorithms in ShapeLogic are not using anything too languages specific so they should be portable to similar languages say C++ and C#. The idea with ShapeLogic is that it should be a declarative framework for vision and you should be able to get work done by making rules instead of regular procedural or object oriented programming.  For example should be able to make a list of rules for categorizing the shape of a particle in a particle analyzer. You put them in a database or a flat file and the same rules should work for C++ and Java version of ShapeLogic. </p>

<p>Blog Declarative Computer Vision Roadmap </p>

<p>ShapeLogic 1.6 Java improve neural networkExtend Multi-layer feed forward neural network to work with letter matcher Add functionality to load neural network from file Low hanging fruits for ShapeLogic JavaExpand OCR to cover lower case letters using neural network matching Component framework for hybrid and complex vision problems Make custom rules to recognize specific cells. In v 1.3 the user has to make rules themselves. Mainly pending finding a relevant test case. HSV mode for the particle analyzer Examples applicationsAutomatic color and gray scale particle counter and analyzer, first medical image processing example Letter matching example. Very rudimentary OCR. Mathematical problems from Project Euler. This is a list of 192 mathematical problems that can be solved by computers. They vary in complexity from simple to hard. The goal is to test ShapeLogic&#39;s new declarative and functional constructs on real problems and make sure they are terse and intuitive. Site last modified 2009-05-14</p>

 summary : <p>WhatHere you will find a repository of scientific libraries and programs written primarily in Java covering a wide berth of topics. In making these tools available to the public, the author hopes that they will save you time from having to write your own. </p>

<p>Currently, the following projects are included: </p>

<p>The Shared Scientific Toolbox, a library for scientific computing. It features a multidimensional arrays package, a high-performance networking package, an advanced class loading framework, a dataflow engine for multi-core, and JNI bindings to the highly-acclaimed FFTW library. Dapper, a large-scale, lightweight distributed computing environment built as an alternative to systems like Apache&#39;s Hadoop and Microsoft&#39;s Dryad. It provides configuration-free setup, rich and robust semantics for dynamic modification of the dataflow graph at runtime, and a user interface for dataflow visualization and management. Miscellaneous utilities like SCMSync (not to be confused with the official Subversion tool of a similar name), which allows synchronization of Git and Subversion source/destination working images in any pairing. </p>

<p>12/06/2008A new version has been uploaded. It was released mainly because there was a relatively serious bug when copying folders from one pane to the other. Another bug with middle-clicking to close tabs has been fixed and the functionality has improved somewhat. The CurrentChangelog has been updated with more details. Recently I have been experimenting with localization to allow SharpFile to be used with other languages. After that is more support for file operations like copying/moving/deleting for a better user experience. </p>

<p>I have also been working on a prototype of a Windows 7-like dock/app launcher/taskbar. There is a project for that on GoogleCode, but no releases just yet. Any feedback is appreciated for either project, though! </p>

<p>09/24/2008Work on SharpFile is going to stop for a few months because my wife and I just had our first child together about three weeks ago. Once he is on more of a schedule and I have some uninterrupted time to get some work done there are lots of ideas and enhancements I have for the project. </p>

<p>08/23/2008The new version of SharpFile is 0.7.6.572. It includes lots of changes including a brand new docking/tabbing solution (DockPanel Suite), which will allow much greater flexibility in the future. I decided to release an interim download before 0.8 because there have been so many changes that were done in the code, including dynamic support for plugins, lots of new keyboard functionality related to the new docking solution and usability enhancements. The CurrentChangelog should be up to date for more information. Please report any problems in the issue tracker. </p>

<p>07/21/2008Lots of work has gone into 0.8 so far. A new docking docking solution has been implemented with Weifen Lou&#39;s excellent DockPanel Suite that will provide a much nicer overall look. It will also enable a more &quot;free-form&quot; docking ability to drag and drop browsers in any configuration you might want. Also completed is a new command line plugin that allows the user to execute files from a command line (it can also process the output and display it, like a regular command line). Hopefully, the rest of the proposed features will be finished soon and then 0.8 will be released.  </p>

<p>If you have Visual Studio 2005+ and svn installed you can always download the current source and attempt to build it to see the new features! I try to keep the source as functional as possible, but be aware that there may be some regressions when testing nightly builds! </p>

<p>UDPATE: Oops, I almost forgot to mention that if you find bugs, please report them in the issue tracker so I can take a look. </p>

<p>06/12/2008Version 0.7.061208 uploaded to fix some bugs and add in some small new features including configurable hotkeys. Download links and CurrentChangelog are updated. </p>

<p>05/20/2008Update 0.7.051208 to 0.7.052008 to fix issues with viewing the contents of compressed files. Download links and CurrentChangelog are updated. </p>

<p>05/12/2008Update 0.7 to 0.7.051208 to fix a tiny issue where the Time column was showing the date by default. Download links and CurrentChangelog are updated. </p>

<p>05/11/2008New release available! Check out the CurrentChangelog in the wiki section and download version 0.7!</p>

 summary : <p>Shed Skin is an experimental compiler, that can translate pure, but implicitly statically typed Python programs into optimized C++. It can generate stand-alone programs or extension modules that can be imported and used in larger Python programs. </p>

<p>Besides the typing restriction, programs cannot freely use the Python standard library (although about 20 common modules, such as random and re, are currently supported). Also, not all Python features, such as nested functions and variable numbers of arguments, are supported (see the tutorial for details). </p>

<p>For a set of 44 non-trivial test programs (at over 10,000 lines in total (sloccount)), measurements show a typical speedup of 2-40 times over Psyco, and 2-220 times over CPython.

 summary : <p>shhArc is an embedded extensible scripting language compiler, virtual machine, and sandboxed agent scriping system. It is designed with real time solutions in mind. We are currently looking for people to alpha test it before release. Please contact the project owner if you are interested. </p>

<p>Here is a review of features: </p>

<p>•	Ability to script in any LALR parsable language given a grammer and rules file for the language. This implies the ability to design your own scripting language for use with the compiler and VM. Currently comes packages with the rules for c/c++. </p>

<p>•	Link time type checking and function call resolution. </p>

<p>•	Ability to run scripts written in different  languages on same VM and process. </p>

<p>•	Function visability privileges allowing for inter-script/inter-function restricted access. </p>

<p>•	Seamless extendibility and integration of VM into c++ engine allowing for; c++ engine functions and object member functions to be called from scripts, scripts and functions to be called from c++, c++ engine classes to be used in scripts, c++ engine member variables to be accessable in scripts, and c++ class data variables to be exchanged between the engine and scripts with ability to integrate with engine reference counting garbage collection. </p>

<p>•	Scriptable classes with single public inheritance, public and protected interfaces, and virtual functions. Embodies obejct orientated encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. </p>

<p>•	Integral single dimension array data type for all soft and hard data types. </p>

<p>•	Pointers to objects (no pointer arithmetic). </p>

<p>•	Function pointers. </p>

<p>•	User definable integral number data type optimised for speed. Define int, double or even a class as your integral data type so it performs faster than ordinary data types registered with the vm. </p>

<p>•	Variant data type. </p>

<p>•	Explicit casting between c++ engine types  used in script. </p>

<p>•	Explicit data passing in function calls as well as pointer passing. </p>

<p>•	Sand boxed agent messageing including send message, post message and timers. </p>

<p>•	Type registering to allow consistent exchange of data between VMs and engines. </p>

<p>•	Uses VM processes to run script function call threads so can have multiple processes operating on the same code and data. </p>

<p>•	Optional time slicing of processes to manage time allocation spent on each process. </p>

<p>•	Ability to perform pre-emptive multi tasking. </p>

<p>•	Yeilding feature to halt a VM process update until a callback is received. </p>

<p>•	Optional instruction count overflow catching to stop infinite loops. </p>

<p>•	Thread safe VM so can distribute updating of VM processes on different threads and processors. </p>

<p>•	Relative addressing of all data so data can be moved or resized at runtime. </p>

<p>•	Uses true stack so garbage collection only required for heap newed data. </p>

<p>•	Reference counted garbage collection so no garbage collection phase. </p>

<p>•	Self regulating memory manager cache. </p>

<p>•	Modular engine framework. </p>

 summary : <p>Note about site news
<br/>Check NewStuff frequently. 
<br/>Currently, the following plugins are hosted on this site:Sound Volume updated History Editor Version 2 (compatible with Miranda 0.7 or later) tabSRMM stable version 2.x.x.x. This is the Miranda 0.7 compatible version of tabsrmm. Ongoing development of the plugin happens on the main Miranda SVN repository. This site maintains the stable code base which all users should use until Miranda 0.8 will come out (that will definitly take some time). Releases are still available on the official Miranda addons site (aka the &quot;File listing&quot;). For documentation and changelogs, refer to the Wiki. </p>

<p>You can find all available downloads here. Source code is available via anonymous SVN access. </p>

<p>Reporting bugs and other issuesPlease report any issues on the issue tracker which you can also find on this site. When doing so, please tag your report properly and indicate for which plugin you filed the report. </p>

<p>Bugs and issues for tabSRMM and clist_nicer should be reported on the official Miranda bug tracker, because these plugins are part of the main Miranda source code repository. </p>

<p>Notes about the sound volume pluginPlease note that the sound volume plugin should be considered finished. I do not plan to continue its development except for fixing major bugs (which I believe, should not exist in the current release). The version you can find on the download page is for Miranda 0.7 or later only, please do not use it with Miranda 0.6 or earlier versions (it may not even load). </p>

<p>History editorThis plugin was originally written by Jonathan Gordon in 2004. Due to the many changes in Miranda, it became incompatible with the new, UTF-8 based message storage format which was introduced during the 0.7 development cycle. The problem is serious, because history editor can render a message history using this storage method unreadable. </p>

<p>Miranda 0.8 will therefore not load it any longer.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve made the decision to update this plugin to make it again compatible. While doing this, I redesigned a few things and added a feature which allows to automatically fix wrong timestamps in the message history. Such timestamps can happen, when someone has set the system clock on his PC to a &quot;future&quot; date. When the date is later corrected (set back), message events with timestamps pointing into the future may exist. While this is not an inherent problem for Miranda, it can confuse a number of plugins, resulting in incorrect message display.</p>
 summary : <p>A 3D turn-based RPG engine and adventureThe SilverTree RPG project will produce  a 3D RPG with a hybrid real time, turn based system.  </p>

<p>SilverTree intends to include a wide range of adventuring activities, in addition to combat and looting.  In the wilderness tracking and stealth can provide the all-important element of surprise in combat, or allow the player to avoid more powerful foes.  Literacy allows characters to use books and manuscripts to study new skills. </p>

<p>Grinding will be minimized.  Less experience is gained each time the same type of enemy is defeated, and healing is not easily obtained.  Most enemies will try to flee from the PC when they have little chance of survival. </p>

<p>SilverTree will allows play as several different types of heros.  The PC&#39;s response to moral dilemmas will be measured on several scales such as Honest </p>

<p> Deceptive, and NPCs will react accordingly, but there is not only one right answer.</p>

 title : The simm-ms Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SIMM Management SystemIn April 2005, Anodyne Productions released the SIMM Management System, a project currently ongoing under the auspices of Anodyne Productions, and joined the handful of content management systems geared toward helping Star Trek RPG game masters administer their sites. “It’s designed to be user friendly for the user, the game master, the modder, and the coder,” was the way that Jon Matterson, leader of the project at the time, summed up this unique system when it was first released. In little time, SMS bolted to the front of the pack with its easy installation and user friendly interface. In spite of its growing popularity, SMS still suffered from several shortcomings, but with its burgeoning community behind it, bug fixes and new features began to pop up. Eleven months after its initial release, a compilation of bug fixes and features from the community became SMS 1.5, further solidifying SMS’s status as the premier RPG management system. </p>

<p>Rebuilt from the ground up, SMS 2 offered a whole new experience to Star Trek online RPGs. Taking a page from the original release of SMS, Anodyne Productions created a product that offered both simplicity, ease of use, and unbelievable power to control simulations the way a game master wanted. SMS 2 was the best of both worlds: the familiarity and ease of use of SMS 1 matched with a whole new engine running the world’s most powerful RPG manager. Only a handful of code made its way through the rigorous development process, meaning that “under the hood,” SMS 2 was brand new and better than ever! With the ability to do multi-author joint posts, department head NPC management within their department, and skin management, SMS 2 further established itself as the premier RPG management system. </p>

<p>One year later, Anodyne pulled the covers off the biggest release since SMS 2.0 with version 2.5. Boasting a brand new user access control system, tabbed interfaces, and a slew of new features being added with every minor update, SMS 2.5 became the gold standard for which RPG management was measured against. “SMS isn’t for everyone,” project leader David VanScott said, “but we want to make a product that people can use to stop worrying about their sites and just get back to playing the game.” </p>

<p>Marking the second anniversary of the release of SMS 2.0, Anodyne has unveiled SMS 2.6 that further builds on all the success before it. “It’s all about refinement,” VanScott said of this release. SMS 2.6 takes the best features of SMS 2.5 and makes them even better. Tab content being immediately available, private messaging updates, departmental databases, more streamlined menu management, a re-written activation page, improved Apache compatibility, and a handful of security improvements means that SMS is again establishing itself as the premier RPG management tool and laying the groundwork for the things to come in SMS 3.</p>
 summary : <p>NOTE: This project is effectively discontinued since it appears someone else had similar starting goals and spent a lot more time and effort getting it done properly than the little spent by me due to necessity: http://god.rubyforge.org/ </p>

<p>This project is kept for now but will probably be deleted. </p>

<p>A minimalistic monitoring system that is intended to be: </p>

<p>Self-contained (no web server needed). Fairly minimalistic (it does require Ruby, but is otherwise small). Network transparent. Suitable for trivially plugging in custom sensors and using them reliably, without putting extreme requirements on the quality of the sensors themselves. It is specifically designed for cases where there is no infrastructure in place, and where such infrastructure is not feasable. Typically single machines, or a small collection of machines.</p>

 summary : <p>easy ORM (Object Relational Mapping)We had to change the name of this project because of one of the already existing more matured project which is also called &quot;Simple ORM&quot;Recently there have been lots of hype about dynamic languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Many have blogged about pros and cons of RoR and such dynamic languages. The hype is so high that it made me learn (J)RoR. After some reading and some projects on RoR I learned that programmers love these languages because of its ease of use and I loved it too. Many also say that these kind of languages are &quot;threat&quot; to Java, after all Java is complex!! </p>

 summary : <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE   This project is no more under development. The 2.0 version of SPG is currently under development using the Launchpad platform at https://code.launchpad.net/simple-pygame-gui. Join the project now. </p>

<p>After evaluating different pygame gui systems, I finally decided that none was exactly the one I needed for my games, an easy-to-setup and to-use, fast, lightweight and well-integrated gui system. </p>

<p>The goal of this gui is to be extremely easy to use, and setup especially, and to be quickly and well integrated in any pygame game. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all contained in a py module: just import it and go! </p>

<p>Features implemented so far: </p>

<p>No initialization needed. Just import and go. Style based GUI, to avoid to pass paremeters like font and font color everywhere, keeping your code compact and reusable Functions to create styles quickly (and not by hand). Optimizations to refresh your widget only when strictly needed. Desktop widget to contain all kinds of widgets, keeping them ordered correctly: if you add a button and a window to a desktop, the button will always be drawn UNDER the window. Label widget with autosizing and wordwrapping. Skinnable button widget with all kinds of statuses (normal, mouse-over, pressed and disabled). Skinnable (or vector) window widget with fast z-ordering. Just add it to your desktop widget, and it will do the rest. - Full-featured textbox widget, with flat or 3D appearence, automatic scrolling (singleline text so far but going to upgrade it soon). Skinnable ImageButton to create your personal button based on images (one for each status). Skinnable CheckBox and Optionbox. Customizable ListBox with mouse-wheel/keyboard scrolling.</p>

<br/>Albert Einstein </p>

<p>IntroductionThere must be a gazillion Tetris clones out there... Why another one?. Because I couldn&#39;t find a clone like this with a liberal open source license and programmed with code legibility in mind. There are other projects like this but many have GPL licenses that make troublesome their use in commercial projects or console development. </p>

<p> 
<br/>ObjectivesThis clone must be simple to understand and because that, easy to tweak (if you want to use it for your own projects). Changing rendering and input layers must be a breeze and even the core gameplay functions should be easy to port to another platforms or languages. Ultimately, it must serve as an educational reference for novice game programmers. The good thing about Tetris is that it has a very well known gameplay mechanic and it is relatively simple to implement but challenging enough for not being trivial. </p>

<p>FeaturesThe core logic is programmed in simple ANSI C. The core gameplay logic is separated from the layers in charge of presenting the game to the player. Those layers would be responsible for drawing sprites on screen, handling input devices, returning timer values, or even playing sounds and music, so the game must be platform agnostic. The trunk implementation uses the awesome cross-platform SDL library for graphics and input. </p>

<p>This is the list of expected features I&#39;m aiming: </p>

<p>A simple Tetris experience. The user must easily recognize the game and spent some time with it. Full separation between the core gameplay implementation and the graphic, input, sound, or font libraries that could be used by the game. No global neither static variables in the core game implementation (because global things are bad things). Good code standards and formatting (because code is poetry). The ambition of this little project is to become the default implementation whenever you need a simple clone and don&#39;t want to rewrite your own from zero. </p>

<p>LimitationsBecause the trunk for this project must be simple (and I&#39;m lazy) some limitations are imposed: </p>

<p>No Wall Kick  No Game Menu Screens No Effects No Sound Branches are encouraged to implement the missing parts or even create gameplay variations. </p>

<p>BranchesThis is the list of currently implemented and possible future branches: </p>

 summary : <p>Simple-Ujs is a plugin that turns all of your view into Unobstrusive Javascripts views. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to learn any new syntax or a whole bunch of new helpers, you have just to call 1 helper (&lt;%= flush_ujs_handlers_list %&gt;) at the bottom of your master templates as close to the closing tag. </p>

<p> flush_ujs_handlers_list(path = {}, session_id = nil)  </p>

<p>&#39;path&#39; </p>

<p>is the url path to the controller/action that will serve the javascript stored in the session with id of session_id. 
<br/>The default path is /javascripts/ujs_handler and you can pass either a Hash or a String  
<br/>&#39;Session_id&#39; is the name of the session that will store the javascript code. The default session name is &#39;ujs_script&#39;  </p>

<p>When you install this plugin it will automatically copy the file from /lib/simple_ujs/javascripts_controller.rb into your controllers folder. (From RAILS_ROOT run ruby vendor/plugins/simple_ujs/install.rb) </p>

<p>The content of that file is as follows. </p>

<p>	class JavascriptsController &lt; ApplicationController
<br/>	  def ujs_handler
<br/>	    render :update do |page|
<br/>	      page &lt;&lt; session[:ujs_script]
<br/>	    end
<br/>	  end
<br/>	endThere is a global setting SimpleUjs::Base.use_ujs that can be set to either true or false to activate or deactivate the SimpleUjs plugin. </p>

<p>The SimpleUjs plugin also moves all of your javascript includes called with the javascript_include_tag method to the bottom of the page right before the call to /javascripts/ujs_handler. I do this because I strongly agree with Douglas Crockford. I can be convinced to make it user-choice though if somebody has reason. The bottom of the page is the best place to insert javascript includes from a page load and performance perspective. </p>

<p>This plugin is for people like me that are sometimes lazy and believe that the best possible setting for any tool should always be the default one. </p>

SimpleAjax will take care of all the event handling and data collection tasks that need to be done in JavaScript so all you have to do is write the server part. SimpleAjax will also take the server response and put it anywhere on the page for you. You do not need to write a single line of JavaScript.  </p>

<p>FeaturesNo coding: No JavaScript coding, that is. Just some simple HTML attributes. Server-side coding required. Lean HTML: Requires fewer HTML additions and therefore less overhead, making your page lean and bandwidth efficient. Speed: No waiting till &quot;onload&quot; for it to work, and no DOM traversal overhead at startup. Simplicity: This tool is not over-engineered so you don&#39;t have to be a rocket scientist. Small API: Only just 4 permutations of parameters and 1 function name to remember. DemosFeature Tests, Tab Widget, YouTube Test </p>

<br/>The above snippet will call play.php?q=3 and place the returned HTML into a div with id &quot;vid1&quot;. See this demo. </p>

<p>ScopeSimpleAjax is not a framework or a library. It doesn&#39;t help you write object-oriented code, or compact code, or make things fly across the page. It doesn&#39;t try to simulate the desktop with dialogs and widgets. Instead it is designed to do one thing only, which is to send data to the server and update the page, without ever leaving the page. This is where AJAX is supposed to shine: in its ability to not disrupt the user&#39;s work flow.</p>
 title : The simpledb-dev Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SimpleDB/dev provides a local SimpleDB server, so you can develop offline, without even currently having a SimpleDB account. </p>

<p>Now supports Linux, OS X and Windows &gt;=XP. </p>

<p>Currently implemented: </p>

<p>The current 2007-11-07 REST API EVERY Action - SimpleDB/dev is functionally complete :o) Correct HTTP Error Responses, as per the technical documentation A large suite of tests created from the examples provided in the technical documentation Currently not implemented: </p>

<p>The SOAP API. Authentication - signature value checking. Timestamp format and expiration checking. HTTPS To run a SimpleDB/dev server, you&#39;ll need python (tested with 2.5, standard with OS X Leopard), and web.py (tested with 0.3.1). You can install web.py easily if you have python&#39;s easy install on your path: </p>

<p>easy_install web.pyIf you don&#39;t have easy install, you can install it by downloading the bootstrapper ez_install.py, and running it. (Windows users, easy_install.exe is installed in the Scripts directory in your python directory.) </p>

<p>Windows users will have to also install the Python extensions for windows. </p>

<p>So now just download the latest release, and start up the SimpleDB/dev web server: </p>

<p>python simpledb_dev.py If the server doesn&#39;t start, or you have other problems, it&#39;s pretty easy to run the tests and see some examples of request/response: </p>

<p>python simpledb_dev.py testRemember, this is a development tool, and not meant for storing or querying large amounts of data - I do not know yet how big you can get before running into issues, but I suspect that with the current storage and querying design it is not that large :o) Now that I have a base, I may start trying to see how I can improve the performance... </p>

<p>Although this conforms to the specifications in the technical documentation, SimpleDB/dev has not been tested with every possible SDB client library, and I am looking forward to people in the oss community trying to find bugs and peculiarities - it is after all, a work in progress! </p>

<p>So enjoy developing your SimpleDB applications now, not later! </p>

 title : The simpledbm Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SimpleDBM is an OpenSource Transactional Database Engine in Java. It has  a very small footprint and can be embedded in the address space of an application. It provides a simple programming API, which can be learned very quickly. More recently work is being done to provide a network API for remote access. </p>

<p>FeaturesSimpleDBM has the following features: </p>

<p>Transactional - SimpleDBM fully supports ACID transactions. SimpleDBM uses a STEAL/NO-FORCE buffer management strategy for transactions. Multi-threaded - SimpleDBM is multi-threaded and supports concurrent reads and writes of data. Write Ahead Log - SimpleDBM uses a write ahead log to ensure transaction recovery in the event of system crashes. Lock based concurrency - SimpleDBM uses shared, update and exclusive row locks to manage concurrency.  Multiple Isolation Levels - SimpleDBM supports read-committed, repeatable-read, and serializable isolation levels. B-Tree Indexes - SimpleDBM implements B-plus Tree indexes, that fully support concurrent reads, inserts and deletes. SimpleDBM B-Trees continually re-balance themselves, and do not suffer from fragmentation. Tables - SimpleDBM supports tables, but for maximum flexibility, treats table rows as blobs of data. Table rows can have any internal structure as you like, and can span multiple disk pages. Standard table rows with multiple columns are supported via add-on modules. Latches and Locks - SimpleDBM uses latches for internal consistency, and locks for concurrency. Latches are more efficient locking mechanisms that do not suffer from deadlocks. Deadlock detection - SimpleDBM has support for deadlock detection. A background thread periodically checks the lock table for deadlocks and aborts transactions to resolve deadlocks. </p>

<p>Non FeaturesSimpleDBM is not an SQL engine.  There is no support for distributed transactions (XA) yet. StatusSimpleDBM is currently in early BETA and not suitable for use in Production systems. The latest builds can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/simpledbm/downloads/list. </p>

<p>LicenseSimpleDBM is licensed under GPL v2 with a clause similar to GNU Classpath Exception. </p>

<p>NOTICEThe license has changed with the new SimpleDBM RSS 1.0.15 BETA release. A GNU Classpath Exception clause has been added to the license.</p>

<p>What&#39;s New?Using SimpleJPA with Groovy Sessionless mode SecondLevelCache CaveatDue to the nature of SimpleDB, SimpleJPA is a subset of the features of the full JPA spec and may never become a full implementation. SimpleDB is not your dad&#39;s relational database. Then why base this on JPA you might ask? Because JPA is a very nice, well thought out specification that is based on real world use (ie: Hibernate). Most importantly are the JPA annotations that make defining persistence on your objects easy. </p>

All SiteScraper requires is the titles from one example search and then it can build a model to extract the titles from future Amazon searches. </p>

<p>(To run this example first update the titles to what Amazon now returns and for more robust results provide a number of example cases.)  </p>

<p>Model formatInternally SiteScraper models the data in a webpage using Xpaths.  Here is an example Xpath: </p>

<p>/html[1]/body[1]/div[position()&gt;1]/ul[@class=&#39;big&#39;]/liThis Xpath will match all list elements within an unordered list of class &#39;big&#39; within the second and following divs (index starts from 0) within the body of the HTML document. </p>

<p>InstallSiteScraper is written in pure Python but depends on version 2 of lxml (for the HTML module).  Currently many Linux repositories provide the old version 1, which means you may need to build from source. For example Ubuntu up to version 8.04 used version 1 but 8.10 onwards uses version 2. This dependency is a pain but it is a very useful library.  </p>

<p>Regression testsIncluded with SiteScraper are a set of regression test cases (in testdata/) that successfully extract data from stock sites, news sites, weather sites, web forums, and search engines.  </p>

<p>Each regression test has: </p>

<p>a few example webpages from a website the desired data from each webpage and a list of the xpaths that will locate the desired data See here for an example. The script test.py runs the regression tests and reports which tests fail. </p>

<p>LicenseSiteScraper is licensed under the LGPL license, which means you are free to use it in any project (including commercial) but must publish modifications you make to SiteScraper. </p>

<p>ContactYou can ask questions or tell me how you have used SiteScraper by emailing me at richard@sitescraper.net. I am particularly interested to hear from you if you have a webpage that fails and ideas how to improve SiteScraper to scrape it correctly.
<br/>Thank you!</p>

 summary : <p>Did you know SketchUp models - any SketchUp entity for that matter - can contain Attributes?  In SketchUp parlance, an Attribute is a Name/Value pair.  You may not have known about it because there is no UI to access them. </p>

<p>This Ruby/HTML/JavaScript project aims to address that omission.  Any selectable object can manage their attribute dictionaries (called &#39;categories&#39; here) and name/value pairs (called &#39;attributes&#39; here) using this script. </p>

<p>Just unzip the bundle in your Plugins directory and you&#39;re good to go. </p>

<p>This plug-in doesn&#39;t handle custom UIs for specific attributes or categories, but it could (should?) be extended to do so.</p>

 title : The slither Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Slither is a web framework that was presented as part of Web Programming in Python, co-authored by George K. Thiruvathukal, John P. Shafaee, and Thomas W. Christopher. The book has since gone out of print but will be re-released in a FOSS-compatible form within the next few months. (We will post PDF for the original book here for those who might want to learn more about Free/Open Source development.) </p>

<p>Slither is not a standalone web server implementation (e.g. Tomcat/J2EE, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.) Instead it works entirely within the Apache Web Server setup, yet has a programming interface similar to what you&#39;d find in Java Servlets (but at a higher level). </p>

<p>You can run Slither either via Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or mod_python. While one might question whether anyone would want to do this given the many persistent web application development frameworks out there, we continue to receive many inquiries from people who are basically saying, &#39;I need something like Slither, because my hosting provider or institution won&#39;t allow me to run XYZ...or words to that effect.&#39; There is also something to be said about &#39;running through Apache&#39;. It has a long history, is well-tested, well-supported, scalable and reasonably secure! (Well, these are all true when you know WTH you are doing.) </p>

<p>We have just released the Slither Installation guide, which will help you to get started with running Slither within Apache/CGI.</p>

 summary : <p>Smart FrameworkWhat IS Smart Framework?An extension of Zend Framework whose purpose is to shorten time spent with development of web application fundamentals.  While individual components of Zend Framework are isolated from each other, Smart Framework forms a prepared, very flexible and extensible infrastructure built on them.  What IS NOT Smart Framework:It is not a Content Management System (CMS), but it is possible to build this type of program using it! It is not a competitor to the Zend Framework, but an extension which offers more functionality and enhances the development time.  How does the Smart Framework work?SF uses it&#39;s own library and Zend Framework&#39;s libraries to &quot;lead&quot; the application runtime and to process all tasks that are common for the web application &quot;lifetime&quot;:  Loading of configuration and setting up MVC Connecting to a database (setting up an ORM) User authentication and authorization Selection and loading of correct language version Selection and loading of correct graphical style Significant part of the infrastructure forms a complex hierarchical configuration system that can be used to set up and customize whole framework and developed application.

 summary : <p>Please migrate to YASnippetPlease migrate to YASnippet. YASnippet is a totally rewritten from scratch after I evaluated the feedbacks from smart-snippet. It support more features and works better. Also it is more convenient to configure. The homepage is at here: http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/ . </p>

<p>Pete Kazmier&#39;s snippet.el is a Textmate-like template extension for Emacs. smart-snippet.el enhances snippet.el so that you can now have more control over the expansion of perticular abbrev. You can have the same abbrev expanding into different snippet under different circumstance. </p>

<p>For example, if you know ruby(or perl, similarly), its if has two use </p>

<p>if condition
<br/>  statement
<br/>endand </p>

<p>statement if conditionnow you can see if will expand into the first version if it occurs at the beginning of a line(ignoring spaces), the second version if not. Oh, wait, you may also wish not to expand if when typing in comment. OK, just define these smart-snippets: </p>

<p>(require &#39;ruby-mode)
<br/>(smart-snippet-with-abbrev-table &#39;ruby-mode-abbrev-table
<br/>  (&#39;if&#39; &#39;if $${condition} $.&#39; &#39;(not in-comment?))
<br/>  (&#39;if&#39; &#39;if $${condition}\n$&gt;$.\nend$&gt;\n&#39; &#39;bol?))A screencast can be found here. </p>

<p>You can download smart-snippet.el from here. It NO LONGER requires the separate file snippet.el written by Pete Kazmier. </p>

<p>By default abbrev can&#39;t trigger non-word(like skeleton to expand [&#39; to &#39;). However, smart-snippet comes with an mechanism to bind key to snippet expansion. Now, you can bind the &#39;key to the snippet expand to &#39;[&#39;. That&#39;s not very intresting, isn&#39;t it? But this is smart-snippet! Now I can make &#39;&#39; to expand into &#39;&#39; if in normal state, and expand to \&#39;&#39; if in a string. Also, I can make t an English version currently, but you can refer to the google translater translated page, though maybe not very impressed. </p>

<p>Why SmartyPants?There are a few IOC frameworks around at the moment: Prana (now Spring Actionscript) was probably the first serious DI framework for Flex to get much notice. There&#39;s also Swiz, and others. What sets Smartypants apart from these frameworks?  </p>

<p>The competition is (mostly) inspired by Spring, whereas SmartyPants is inspired by Guice. This is simply my preference, it may or may not be yours. SmartyPants-IOC is just for dependency injection. You may use any application framework you please. I recommend RobotLegs AS3. It does things the way I like, and you can even replace SmartyPants with another injector if you need to. SmartyPants defines the bindings / application structure via ActionScript code, not via XML. Again, this is a stylistic preference. Put your run-time configuration in configuration files, not in your application structure. Injection requests are specified with annotations, like Guice, Spring 2(.5?), and Swiz. You can also use a similar DSL to request instances from the injector. SmartyPants provides live injection - think &quot;the love child of regular dependency injection and Flex data-binding&quot; Getting startedDownload the .swc file from here, or checkout the code via SVN. The project is young, and the docs are growing, but grow they will! Check out the wiki here, or join the discussion group if you&#39;d like to know more. The !ASDocs are currently offline but will return very shortly! </p>

 title : The smokeyaddin Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionSmokey Add-in is a MonoDevelop IDE add-in that integrates commands like &#39;Inspect with Smokey&#39; into the solution and project context menus to run a tool called Smokey analyzing your .NET assembly against a set of rules (which are, basically, &#39;bad code&#39; patterns) and showing the rule violations directly in the IDE. </p>

<p>Implemented Featuressolution and project context menu item &#39;Inspect with Smokey&#39; running the inspection; option page in MonoDevelop options currently only implementing --exclude-name Smokey command line option; results of the inspection output into the Task View pad, just like build errors or warnings Install How-ToFirst, check out the SVN to obtain the latest version of sources. Then, compile it (there is an .mds file in the root directory, which is MonoDevelop solution file) and copy SmokeyAddin.addin.xml, SmokeyAddin.dll, smokey.exe and Mono.Cecil.dll (Smokey needs it to run) from the output directory to your MonoDevelop AddIns folder (e.g. /usr/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/). Run MonoDevelop again — and Smokey will already be integrated into IDE. Hint: instead of copying files, you can create symbolic links to the same files in your local copy output directory to be able to test new version of the add-in right after each build. </p>

<p>TODOImprove the parser; Refactor some spaghetti-code (especially in the parser); Use MonoDevelop&#39;s core process-running API rather than Process.Start; Use a web browser obtained from MonoDevelop.Core.Gui.WebBrowserService to display the pretty HTML output (will need to rewrite the filenames into links and handle them); </p>

<p>Make the options panel per-project, with a list of rules to ignore Add the capability to execute the check after compilation Cache smokey&#39;s output so it doesn&#39;t have to be re-run when reloading the project; Use MonoDevelop&#39;s asych/IMonitor API rather than launching a thread manually; Add correct exception handling mechanism; </p>

 summary : <p>Smooth Migration PluginThe Smooth Migration plugin allows database migrations to continue running instead of aborting on failure. The rake db:migrate task will fail at the end of the migration instead of in the middle. This helps prevent getting stuck between migrations and needing to comment out code to continue migrating. </p>

<p>RequirementsRails &gt;= 1.2 InstallationThe traditional way: </p>

<p>ruby script/plugin install http://smooth-migration.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/smooth_migration/ </p>

<p>Or with piston: </p>

<p>piston import http://smooth-migration.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/smooth_migration/ vendor/plugins/smooth_migration 
<br/>   </p>

<p>ExampleBefore Smooth Migration  == CreateSomeTable: migrating =================================================
<br/>  -- create_table(:users)
<br/>     -&gt; 0.0039s
<br/>  -- add_column(:users, :email, :string)
<br/>     -&gt; 0.0075s
<br/>  -- add_column(:table_does_not_exist, :foo, :string)
<br/>  rake aborted!
<br/>  SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: table_does_not_exist: ALTER TABLE table_does_not_exist ADD &#39;foo&#39; varchar(255)In this example, the migration created the users table, but then failed when attempting to 
<br/>add a column to a table that does not exist.  One problem is that your database is still on the 
<br/>previous schema version, so the next time you try to migrate, it will fail on creating the users table. 
<br/>After Smooth Migration  == CreateSomeTable: migrating =================================================
<br/>  -- create_table(:users)
<br/>     -&gt; 0.0042s
<br/>  -- add_column(:users, :email, :string)
<br/>     -&gt; 0.3769s
<br/>  -- add_column(:table_does_not_exist, :foo, :string)
<br/>     -&gt; ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
<br/>     -&gt; SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: table_does_not_exist: ALTER TABLE table_does_not_exist ADD &#39;foo&#39; varchar(255)
<br/>  -- add_column(:users, :bar, :string)
<br/>     -&gt; 0.0081s
<br/>  == CreateSomeTable: migrated (0.3910s) ========================================</p>

<p>  rake aborted!
<br/>  -- 1 Failures!  Review console output.The exception messages are displayed inline and the migration continues.  At the end of the migration 
<br/>an exception is thrown to abort the rake task and a failure notice is displayed. 
<br/>UsageYour migrations will become smooth after installing the plugin.  If you want to migrate the old way, use: </p>

<p>  rake db:migrate SMOOTH=false   Or, in your environment configuration file: </p>

 title : The snackr Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>v0.39 &quot;officially&quot; released (finally)February 15, 2010: Since v0.39 has been in the wild for over a year and it seems to be working pretty well (and fixes serious bugs in 0.33), I&#39;ve finally gotten around to putting it up on snackr.net. One of these days I&#39;ll have to get back to this thing and actually add new features! </p>

<p>v0.39 TEST build--candidate for official releaseDecember 15, 2008: After a long hiatus, I&#39;ve just posted a new test build, 0.39. There are just a few new features and bugfixes in this release (see the release notes), including the much-requested option to remove Snackr from the taskbar on Windows. However, I&#39;d like to promote this to an official build that gets pushed out to all Snackr users through autoupdate.  </p>

<p>So, please back up your database and feed list, download v0.39 TEST and check it out! As always, file any issues you find using the issue tracker here on Google Code. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m thinking of instituting an &quot;official&quot; beta program for Snackr. The requirements for participation are low--you just have to be willing to get announcement emails every so often, download new test builds as they come out, use them for a few days, and answer a quick survey on how well the build is working for you. If you&#39;re interested, please fill out the beta signup form. </p>

<p>Google Reader integration is here!July 21, 2008: A test version with Google Reader integration is here! Back up your Snackr database AND your Google Reader feed list, read the release notes, then download v0.38 TEST. Thanks to Rob Adams for all his hard work on this.  </p>

<p>NOTE: if you enable Google Reader integration, and you delete a feed in Snackr, it will automatically be deleted in Google Reader as well (and if you add a feed in Snackr, it will get added to Reader too). We plan to make this optional in the future. (If you downloaded the previous 0.37 build, this build doesn&#39;t have any new functionality, but makes the synchronization of feeds between Snackr and Google Reader clearer.) </p>

<p>There are also a few other features, such as the ability to post items to email, del.icious, digg, etc.--and a bunch of bug fixes. See the release notes for details. </p>

<p>What is Snackr?Snackr is an RSS ticker that pulls random items from your feeds and scrolls them across your desktop. When you see a title that looks interesting, you can click on it to pop up the item in a window. The project is owned by Narciso Jaramillo . </p>

<p>Snackr is built using Adobe AIR and Flex. You can hack on Snackr using the free Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR SDKs, but life will be much easier if you use Adobe Flex Builder, an Eclipse-based IDE for developing Flex applications. </p>

<p>The main Snackr home page is at http://snackr.net; official release builds are posted there. Interim test builds will be posted here for folks who like to live on the bleeding edge; please read the notes on test builds before installing one. </p>

<p>Please file bugs and feature requests using the issue tracker, or send me mail at . Thanks!</p>

<p>DescriptionSnippely is a basic text and code organizational tool. Instead of storing bits of code, quick notes, and memos in text files all over your hard drive, this application will let you save and organize &quot;snippets&quot; in one convenient location. A snippet is a collection of one or more pieces of code and notes. Snippets are stored in groups for organization and quick retrieval. </p>

<p>A snippet is composed of a title, description, and one or more &#39;snips&#39;. You can add any number of note and code snips in a variety of different languages (more to be added). When not being edited, the snip will be syntax highlighted according to the language selected. Snips are also sortable so you can organize your snippet however you want. Since everything is saved to a local database as you work, there&#39;s no need to worry about pressing the save button or submitting a form. </p>

 title : The socialstratification Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TitleTo be determined. </p>

<p>MotivationIn the areas of sociology and political science, among others, it is not only useful but imperative to understand the social stratification of a demographic data set. Social stratification is the heieracrical arrangement of social classes. This arrangement can be based on many characteristics, such as race, income level, or profession. The study of social stratification can lend insight into trends resulting from the class hierarchies. For example, in an overly simplified example, one can compare the annual income of black families to that of white families and draw conclusions from it. Therefore a robust tool for observing social stratification is needed to be able to accurately compare these data and draw correct conclusions. </p>

<p>Previous WorkIn a seminar class I took in 2007, my adviser and I, along with several other students, undertook the task of improving a previously existing social stratification visualization tool, as well as designing and implementing our own. These tools can be found at http://cs.wheatoncollege.edu/mgousie/research.html under &quot;Visualization of Social Stratification&quot;. </p>

<p>GoalsMy goal is to implement a more streamlined, easy-to-use, robust, and comprehensive tool to visualize this data. This tool will combine all of the strengths and hopefully weed out all of the weaknesses of the preexisting programs. The data will be taken from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, and it will be updatable and complete. The visualization tool itself will be written in Ruby, while the data will be stored in an SQL database. Ruby On Rails will be used to interface with the database.</p>

 title : The soco Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Ruby on Rails project to allow University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students to collaboratively plan class schedules together, both in the long-term and for individual semesters. </p>

<p>Vision: Collaboration and working in small groups in courses is an important aide to learning and succeeding in college. However, class sizes are increasing and the number of TAs are decreasing. As a result, discussion sections with small group settings have more or less disappeared. Creating these small group environments has become more difficult for the average student at the university. </p>

<p>Our solution to this problem is SoCo, the Social Course Planner. This tool allows students to collaboratively plan their course schedules so that they may be able to register for the same courses as their friends. By doing this, they can form productive study groups, and keep these study groups throughout courses and even throughout their stay at the University. </p>

<p>SoCo will also help students to effectively plan their 4 year schedule. This will allow students to optimally schedule their required courses to not only allow for graduation in 4 years, but to make sure that they will be taking courses during the same semester as their friends. It will also help students to plan ahead for prerequisites. </p>

<p>Other features such as a course review system, automatic semester scheduling, help registering on UI Integrate, and integration with Facebook are also present.</p>

 summary : <p>Rock, Paper, Grenade (formerly known as the working title Soldiers) is a 2D game made with Ruby and Gosu. It&#39;s kind of like Liero, which is kind of like Worms except it&#39;s not turn-based. It can be played by one or two players at one computer. </p>

<p>Though I have ideas for improving the game, I think I might move on to other things now. We&#39;ll see. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Stuff I might do:add gamepad support (with two on the keyboard, this could allow three people to play at a time) add differing AI difficulty levels New game mode: zombie attack. One or two players at top of hill, zombies approach from both sides. New game mode: buy weapons with Counterstrike model - lots of (some quite similar) weapons, buy at start of each round, etc. Maybe you always start with three weapons of the bazooka, rifle, grenade kind, but you can upgrade each (if you can afford it) to variants: homing/guided missile/bazooka with poison gas; shotgun or more powerful or automatic or sniper rifle, cluster or stun grenades. Also other upgrades: light armor (for +50 health), heavy armor (+150 health but slows you down), final revenge, etc. add shotgun, homing missile, sniper rifle, other weapons add weapon/health/power-up pick-ups add buildings/bases to destroy? Other game modes? Capture the flag? tidy/refactor code add helicopters and jeeps</p>
 title : The solidground Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SolidGround is a C++ framework intending to offer everything one need to build powerful, distributed, highly-scalable, client-server applications. Its is designed and implemented for speed and power, with great interest on the ease of use by the developers. </p>

<p>Although in first step it will be released only for Linux, its design allows easy porting to other platforms (planned are Solaris and Windows). </p>

<p>Here is a list with what the framework includes: </p>

<p>A powerful build system based on CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) which allows easy integration of applications based on the framework. A system library which wraps up threads, synchronization objects, thread specific, file access, socket address, debug logging engine etc.  Asynchronous signaling engine. Asynchronous TCP and UDP communication engine, single-channel and multi-channel(for easily implementing proxies and other communication nodes, e.g. chat rooms); Secure Socket support for the asynchronous TCP communication, using OpenSSL library(http://www.openssl.org/); Asynchronous multiplexed IPC (Inter Process Communication) / RPC (Remote Procedure Call) engine with keep-alive support for peer disconnection detection. The protocol allows for sending commands (of any size - one can even send file streams) to a peer process over multiplexed UDP. A nice serialization engine (for now only binary, non portable - used by IPC) A nice asynchronous ready, text protocol engine (parser and response builder) for protocols like IMAP, POP, SMTP etc. A file stream manager for asynchronous usage (e.g. if you want a read-only stream for a file which is locked for writing, the manager will signal you the stream when unlocked) A nice audit/log engine. Doxygen documentation. Lots of test applications, including a central proof of concept multi service server.     </p>

 summary : <p>OverviewAn iLife ’08 like source list. Unlike other implementations, this view descends straight from NSView and is completely custom. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>SourceList exposes four bindings: </p>

<p>NSContentBinding; an enumerable collection, typically bound to the arrangedObjects object of an NSTreeController or another compatible controller KDContentImagesBinding; bound to the model subpath for the row images NSContentValuesBinding; bound to the model subpath for the row titles KDSelectionIndexPathBinding; bound to the controller&#39;s singular selection index path multiple selections aren&#39;t currently allowed DependenciesMac OS X Leopard 10.5 Objective-C 2.0 SourceList is dependent on a framework (AmberKitAdditions) contained inside another one of my projects Amber found at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework which must be available at compile time.  </p>

<p>Using the ControlThe easiest way to use SourceList is to instead download Amber.framework which contains all my custom UI controls and the AppKit additions required to use them. </p>

<p>Otherwise you can download the code for this project alone using an svn:external property to pull the &#39;code&#39; subdirectory, i.e. http://sourcelist.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/application/code, you could also pull the &#39;code&#39; directory from a branch or tag. </p>

<p>Building the ControlIf you checkout the entire project and are building it from source then the Xcode project must be able to find the Amber Xcode project. </p>

<p>It expects to find the Amber working copy at the same level as it&#39;s own working directory. It must also be able to link the framework; the two projects should either share their build products directory, or you must set custom header search paths.

 title : The spacebuild Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Garrysmod Gamemode: Spacebuild, </p>
 summary : <p>Milestones: Here </p>

<p>Cheesman52&#39;s orginal ideaere is my idea. Somebody could make a models pack with pre-built parts for ships. I&#39;m not talking about a entire pre made ship I&#39;m talking about the parts. We could have hall ways,pre built ship hulls with holes on the side so we can connect like other parts to main hull. I love space build but making a closed ship that looks good takes a while. This would cut time by alot and give more time for exploring. You could also have individual parts for like space stations. Could have a central p remade hub and have p remade hall ways to connect to other rooms. I don&#39;t know much about lag and stuff like that but I think these thing would reduce lag. Instead of having a bunch of props for a space station you could have as little as one. Please leave positive feedback. Sorry for bad spelling, my sister spill t juice on keyboard and now it all sticky. Please give me gold stars if you like it please! </p>

<p>Current AimsThe idea is simple, but far reaching, a model pack, specifically (but not limited to) spacebuild. The idea revolved around several sets of components that may be connected together to form a working (good looking) ship, with very little difficult, lag, or prop usage. </p>

<p>For example, I could spawn a pre-made ship hull, attach a bridge section, several mounts for engines, a couple of wings, put LS on it, add some thrusters and I&#39;ve a working, original, and good looking ship. </p>

<p>Or for even more originality i could spawn some different parts of a hull, assemble a hull of the exact shape and size I required, construct some engine mounts from several more parts, and a bridge section from more, add some bays (cargo bay, bridge bay), then add thrusters LS (in said cargo bay) and I&#39;d have again, a very simple, very good looking ship, that causes very very little lag compared to the same ship made from PHX (less props, and less complicated collisions) </p>

<p>Also Fighter hulls would be available, not to mention the myriad of bays, and even totally unoriginal pre-made ships! </p>

<p>Our mission planPossible Future Ideas: Spawn &#39;panels&#39; and auto-snap-together system for parts Pressurization for specially codes water maps A game-mode using the parts for ship construction based on a cost (global rp, but with only these parts) Toolgun for spawning items </p>

<p>Medium Term plans: Total premade ships (fully built ship ready to have LS and engines put on) Premade Ship Hulls (internals not there, just the outside) Around a hundred ship &#39;parts&#39; including hull sections, wings, weapon mounts, engine sections, bridges, internal corridors, bays, etc. </p>

<p>Short Term Goal: Basic ship parts in one style (three or so wing types, one set of corridors, a cargo and fighter bay, just enough parts to make a ship a few different ways) Connection system based around &#39;pegs&#39; (like lego almost) </p>

 title : The sparsh-ui Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Project GoalIowa State University&#39;s Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) is developing a multitouch API for enabling users to create multi-touch applications easily on a variety of hardware platforms. The API supports custom hardware drivers and is platform independent. </p>

<p>Project ComponentsGesture Server: The Sparsh-UI Gesture Server is the main piece of the application.  It handles gesture processing and passes touchpoints and/or gesture information to the client application.  The Gesture Server supports basic gestures such as drag, scale, and rotate, and is extensible to support an infinite number of user-written custom gestures. </p>

<p>Input Device Driver: A device driver is needed for a device to communicate with the Gesture Server.  The Touchtable team at VRAC has developed device drivers for an optical FTIR system, an infrared bezel, as well as several other devices.  The driver should be capable of passing touchpoint iformation to the Gesture Server. </p>

<p>Gesture Adapter: A client adapter is needed for each GUI framework the Gesture Server intends to communicate with.  The Touchtable team at VRAC is currently working on a Java Swing adapter, with plans to implement other frameworks in the near future. </p>

<p> </p>

 summary : <p>OverviewSpinn3r is a web service for indexing the blogosphere.  We provide raw access to every post being published in real time.  We provide the data and you can focus on building your application.   </p>

<p>Spinn3r handles all the difficult tasks of running a spider/crawler including spam prevention, language categorization, ping indexing, and trust ranking. </p>

<p>You can read more about spinn3r at http://spinn3r.com </p>

<p>Reference ClientThis projects implements client bindings to access the Spinn3r web service. </p>

<p>Right now this just provides Java bindings but we plan porting this implementation to Python, Perl, Ruby, etc (and we&#39;d love help from the Open Source community). </p>

<p>All of our drivers will be released under the Apache 2.0 license. The APL is a very liberal license and basically allows customers and researchers using the Spinn3r API to build whatever type of application they want on top of our platform without having to worry about legal and licensing implications. </p>

<p>Another interesting property of this implementation is that it&#39;s very small and clean. This means ports to other languages should be very easy. </p>

<p>DocumentationSee the permalink API or our source API or our wire protocol and Javadoc </p>

<p>BasicsEach API represents a top level object collection and supports the following methods: </p>

<p>getDelta() - Find all new items based on after and/or before parameters which are ISO 8601 timestamps. entry() - Fetch HTML for a unique item based on URL or a unique identifier. history() - Fetch the history of items for a given source or feed. Permalink APISpinn3r fetches the full HTML of every post published in the blogosphere. </p>

<p>Supports getDelta(), entry(), and history() methods. </p>

<p>Feed APIIndex of all RSS and Atom content included within Spinn3r.  The Permalink API also includes this content so the feed API is only valuable for customers who specifically want to index RSS and might want slightly faster resolution and a bit higher performance. </p>

<p>Supports getDelta(), entry(), and history() methods. </p>

<p>Comment APIWe are currently beta testing an API for indexing comments published in the blogosphere. </p>

<p>Supports getDelta(), entry(), and history() methods. </p>

<p>Link APIIndexes new links as they are published throughout the blogosphere. </p>

<p>Supports getDelta(), entry(), and history() methods. </p>

<p>Other ImplementationsThere is an unofficial native Perl client.  The API design differs slightly from the official reference client but is compatible with the Spinn3r API.</p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionSplat is a daemon designed to help keep information in an LDAP directory in sync with information outside of an LDAP directory. This information can be any set of attributes on any object in the LDAP directory. </p>

<p>Splat currently supports the following: </p>

<p>Writing SSH public keys Writing .forward files Creating user home directories Archiving and deleting home directories of deleted users OpenNMS user synchronization RequirementsPython 2.4+ Twisted Networking Framework Python LDAP ZConfig Additionally, for the OpenNMS plugin you will need </p>

<p>pysqlite2 cElementTree (or Python 2.5+, which includes this module) </p>

<p>InstallationSplat uses the standard Python distutils. To install, run setup.py: </p>

<p>./setup.py installThe splat framework will be installed in the Python site-packages directory. The splatd daemon will be installed in the Python-specified bin directory. An example configuration file, splat.conf, is supplied with the source distribution. </p>

<p>There are also splat packages available for several operating systems. Splat is in the FreeBSD ports collection as net/splatd, in MacPorts as splat, and in Ubuntu as splatd. </p>

<p>CaveatsSplat current stores the full search result in memory. This may cause excessive memory consumption with extremely large result sets. Blocking LDAP calls are used. A complex query or overloaded/unreachable LDAP server may cause Splat to block for significant periods of time. TLS/SSL is supported, but StartTLS is not.</p>

<p>IntroductionSplunk Python SDK is a wrapper around Splunk&#39;s REST API, providing an object model for the major functional components of the Splunk server. The following components are currently accessible via the Python : </p>

<p>Authentication Search Configuration </p>

<p>We continue to work on implementing the wrappers for the other components of the server, including user roles and permissions. </p>

<p>RequirementsSplunk Python SDK client is dependent on two external libraries that you will need to have installed: </p>

<p>httplib2 lxml </p>

<p>Installation  Download and extract the archive. Run python setup.py install  </p>

<p>DocumentationDocumentation section is currently under construction. </p>

<p>Example usageThis simple example establishes a connection with a Splunk server, using it to dispatch a new search job. Then it receives search results and sends them to standard output. </p>

 summary : <p>Sponger   now works with rails 2.1!Sponger is a simple plug-in for creating and modifying calendars, events, and calendar widgets with the Spongecell API. This will easily allow you to create any sort of application or web site that uses events. Sponger is built on top ActiveResource which is included in Rails 2.0. ActiveResource can be used outside of rails if you copy out the ActiveResource libraries from the rails project. </p>

<p>Sponger is developed inside of the Spongewolf project located at: http://github.com/ckhsponge/spongewolf </p>

<p>Git Spongewolf (Sponger is located in the vendor/plugins directory): </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/ckhsponge/spongewolfSvn Sponger: </p>

<p>svn export http://sponger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/spongerThe Sponger portion of the project is mirrored at google code for script/plugin compatibility and for using their forums. </p>

<p>Add Sponger to an existing rails appruby script/plugin install http://sponger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/spongerAdd Sponger to a new rails appGetting a rails app set up to use Sponger for event management is easy! Below are some steps for creating a rails app that displays a web page with a list of events from the site http://remindblast.com. </p>

<p>1. Create the rails appMake sure you have rails 2.0 or later installed. If you&#39;re not sure then run: </p>

<p>gem install railsTo generate your rails app, run the following command: </p>

<p>rails sponger_test2. Install the pluginChange directory into sponger_test and run: </p>

<p>ruby script/plugin install http://sponger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/sponger3. Generate a controller for your appChange directory into sponger_test and run: </p>

<p>ruby script/generate controller sponger4. Add a method to your controllerEdit the file app/controller/sponger_controller.rb and the following method: </p>

<p>  #gets all events from 2008-04-15 that were created from remindblast.com
<br/>  def events
<br/>    @events = Sponger::Event.find(:all,:params=&gt;{:calendar_id=&gt;137619,:start_time=&gt;Date.new(2008,04,15)})
<br/>  end5. Add a viewCreate the file app/views/sponger/events.rhtml and paste the following into it: </p>

<p>  
<br/>  
<br/>6. Start your serverruby script/server start7. Check the resultsPoint your browser at http://localhost:3000/sponger/events. You should see a list of events that were created as reminders. Done!</p>

 title : The spring-on-rails Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Spring-On-RailsSimple idea, great benefit 
<br/>What is Spring-On-Rails?Spring-On-Rails is a rapid Java Enterprise Application development Framework, distantly related to Ruby-on-Rails. Spring-On-Rails is designed to help developers generate a basic skeleton of CRUD-type applications. The generated application is based upon the Spring Framework, Ibatis and Hibernate for Java in the middle tier.  </p>

<p>The basic process of Spring-On-Rails development is very simple: define an object/relational mapping, then run an ant task or maven archetype + plugin to generate the project structure. </p>

<p>This generates a simple create/update/read/delete web or web service application. It&#39;s early in its lifecycle; hopefully others will find it useful. </p>

<p>It&#39;s licensed under the ASL 2.0.  </p>

 title : The spring-webmvc-generics Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Spring Web MVC GenericsSpring Web MVC Generics is a generics friendly extension to the Spring WebMVC framework along with various other utilities found useful when working with spring web mvc. </p>

<p>Latest ReleaseI&#39;ve given up on making new release jars every time something is changed.  Currently this library is in the beta stage (although we&#39;re using it in production and it&#39;s working great) and if you need a release you should checkout the source code and use maven to build a jar. </p>

<p>ProgressSo far the following controllers have been made generic: </p>

<p>BaseCommandController AbstractCommandController AbstractFormController AbstractWizardFormController SimpleFormController </p>

<p>Remaining are: </p>

<p>CancellableFormController </p>

<p>ControllersAll of the generic controller names have the same exact class name as the controller that they are providing generics for with the exception that they exist in the org.springframework.web.servlet.generics.mvc.* package.  Method names are identical when possible with slight parameter reordering to allow for the generic methods to exist.  It should be completely painless and absolutely familiar to use the controllers in the generics package because they behave exactly like the controllers provided by the org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc package (in fact they inherit from them). </p>

<p>This allows for form controllers (or any of the BaseCommandController and descendants for that matter) to look something like this: </p>

<p>import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.generics.AbstractFormController;</p>

<p>public class AnInterestingFormController
<br/>    extends AbstractFormController {
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>    protected abstract ModelAndView processFormSubmission(
<br/>        AnInterestingForm command, BindException errors,
<br/>        HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
<br/>        throws Exception {
<br/>        
<br/>        // operate on command without casting it
<br/>        System.out.println(command.getSomethingInteresting());
<br/>        
<br/>    }
<br/>    
<br/>    
<br/>}

 summary : <p>SPServer is a server framework library written on C++ that implements the Half-Sync/Half-Async and Leader/Follower patterns. It&#39;s based on libevent in order to utilize the best I/O loop on any platform. </p>

<p>SPServer can simplify TCP server construction. It is a hybrid system between threaded and event-driven, and exploits the advantages of both programming models. It exposes a threaded programming style to programmers, while simultaneously using event-driven style to process network connection. </p>

<p>SPServer also include an embedded http server framework -- sphttp. sphttp can simplify to add web server functionality to any C++ app. It is useful for adding Web-based administration or statistics to any C++ program or becoming the server framework of XML-RPC or JSON-RPC. </p>

<p>SPServer is available through the FreeBSD Ports Collection. </p>

 title : The sqlalchemy-validations Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Validations for SQLAlchemySQLAlchemy validations is an easy way to be sure that no inconsistent data will be saved to your database. It is a new extension for SQLAlchemy that checks if an object is consistent according to a customizable set of rules just before being saved to the database.  </p>

<p>ExampleYou have a Person class: </p>

<p>class Person(object):
<br/>    def __init__(self, name, phone, age):
<br/>        self.name = name
<br/>        self.phone = phone
<br/>        self.age = age</p>

<p>    def __repr__(self):
<br/>        return &quot;&quot; % (self.name, self.phone, self.age)Now, we will map it to a person_table (declaration of person_table omitted. See SQLAlchemy docs for more about mapping): </p>

<p>mapper(Person, person_table,
<br/>       extension=[
<br/>                  Validator(range_of(&#39;age&#39;, 0, 150))
<br/>                 ]
<br/>      )The mapper call above is specifying a range validator for the age attribute of Person. Now, if you try to save a Person with age outside of range 0-150 it will raise a ValidationException and no data will be saved: </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Person(&#39;Foobar&#39;, &#39;0123456789&#39;, 1000) # age = 1000
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; session.save(p)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; session.flush()</p>

<p>(traceback omitted)</p>

<p>: Range validation of field &quot;age&quot; of instance of class &quot;Person&quot; failed! Person.age = 1000 (min=0, max=150)You can also add a second validation: </p>

<p>mapper(Person, person_table,
<br/>       extension=[Validator(
<br/>                            range_of(&#39;age&#39;, 0, 150),
<br/>                            format_of(&#39;phone&#39;, re.compile(r&#39;\d{4}-?\d{4}&#39;))
<br/>                           )
<br/>                 ]
<br/>      )The mapper call adds a second validation to Person class. Now its phone attribute must match the format specified by the regular expression. </p>

<p>Using ElixirElixir validations are similar to SQLAlchemy validations, but use a syntax similar to Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord. </p>

<p>The class below implements the same validations of the previous example, but using Elixir. </p>

<p>class Person(Entity):
<br/>    name  = Field(Text)
<br/>    phone = Field(Text)
<br/>    age   = Field(Integer)
<br/>        
<br/>    validates_format_of(&#39;phone&#39;, re.compile(r&#39;\d{4}-?\d{4}&#39;))
<br/>    validates_range_of(&#39;age&#39;, 0, 150)Creating new validatorssqlalchemy-validations is extensible. You can create new validations, inheriting from Validation class in sqlalchemy_validations.py. Take a look at classes FieldFormatValidation and FieldPresenceValidation. They should serve as good examples of how to create your own validations.</p>

 title : The sqlitepersistentobjects Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if your Objective-C data objects just knew how to save and load themselves? It&#39;d be nice if you could just call &quot;save&quot; and trust that your object would save itself properly somewhere, and that when you wanted to load it back in, you could just call a class method to retrieve the object or objects you wanted? </p>

<p>Well, now you can. This project uses the objective-C runtime to implement a pattern similar to ActiveRecord, but driven by the object&#39;s properties rather than the tables in the database. </p>

<p>The objects are completely self-contained - you do not need to write SQL or even create a SQLite file. You just subclass an existing class, and your model objects inherit the ability to load and save themselves from the database.</p>

 title : The sqlpower-library Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The SQL Power Library has grown organically over the years to support several applications. </p>

<p>The projects that use this library include: </p>

<p> SQL Power Architect is an open-source data modeling tool.  SQL Power DQguru (formerly known as SQL Power MatchMaker) is an open-source data cleansing and de-duping tool.  SQL Power Wabit is an open-source Business Intelligence reporting and ad-hoc querying tool.</p>
 summary : <p>Data processing system following a given scenario. The system is a consistent execution of SQL instructions in line with the conditions or rules. Engine is a Java library, which implies its use with the Java platform. </p>

<p>You can use this library for the implementation of the existing or newly created system, which requires frequent change of the data processing rules, and where system rebuilding is critical. In addition, the relative simplicity of syntax allows to create scripts even to those who are not specialists in coding (but still knowledge of the database system scheme and SQL is required).</p>

 title : The squiggle-sql Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Squiggle is a little Java library for dynamically generating SQL SELECT statements. It&#39;s sweet spot is for applications that need to build up complicated queries with criteria that changes at runtime. Ordinarily it can be quite painful to figure out how to build this string. Squiggle takes much of this pain away. </p>

<p>The code for Squiggle is intentionally clean and simple. Rather than provide support for every thing you could ever do with SQL, it provides support for the most common situations and allows you to easily modify the source to suit your needs. </p>

<p>FeaturesConcise and intuitive API. Simple code, so easy to customize. No dependencies on classes outside of JDK 1.5 Small, lightweight, fast. Generates clean SQL designed that is very human readable. Supports joins and sub-selects. Combine criteria with AND, OR and NOT operators. Supports functions in selects and WHERE criteria ExampleHere&#39;s a very simple example: </p>

<p>SelectQuery select = new SelectQuery();</p>

<p>Table people = new Table(&quot;people&quot;);</p>

<p>select.addColumn(people, &quot;firstname&quot;);
<br/>select.addColumn(people, &quot;lastname&quot;);</p>

<p>select.addOrder(people, &quot;age&quot;, Order.DESCENDING);</p>

<p>System.out.println(select);Which produces: </p>

<p>SELECT
<br/>   people.firstname ,
<br/>   people.lastname
<br/>FROM
<br/>    people
<br/>ORDER BY
<br/>    people.age DESCNow continue with the Tutorial...</p>

 title : The srv-1-ce Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SRV-1 CE is an alternative firmware for the SRV-1 robot (www.surveyor.com). Currently the project is in it&#39;s infancy, however hopefully all functionality will be replicated. The code is structured differently to the official firmware, using interrupts and counters to allow a crude form of multitasking. Currently only the very basics are in place (and code is fluctuating rapidly), however as time passes the project should settle down. </p>

<p>Here is the current list of &#39;features&#39;: </p>

<p>Tight, fully modular code structure. Each part of the functionality is self contained, allowing parts to added/removed easily. Modules try to be as generic as possible, allowing code reuse. Fully interrupt driven UART No startup assembly (project uses default crt0.s supplied by GCC. PLL and SDRAM setup in C). No hard coded clock speed. The core and peripheral clock can be controlled by a single  #define. All peripheral timing requirements are calculated automatically based on the defines. Newlib C library, with working printf() statements. </p>

<p>Currently supported peripherals/features: </p>

<p>UART communication (with one-way CTS/RTS). SDRAM (with working malloc()). LEDs. Core Timer (with 16 (adjustable) software counters). i2c communication (Master only, optional Omnivision SCCB mode). Lasers (individual left/right on/off/toggle control). Motor control (left/right percentages).</p>
 summary : <p>Sslib – is the class library for PHP, the aim of which is to simplify web site development and CMS. The main principle of this library is simplicity and logic. It means that in order to select from the base and display the information one does not need to write 5 lines of code and one line is enough. How is it done? It is very simple: Q(&#39;SELECT  FROM table)-&gt;Visualize(&#39;path/to/template&#39;); That’s the only requirement. If one needs to work with each entry, we need to set callback function: ...-&gt;Visualize(&#39;path/to/template&#39;, &#39;callbackFunctionName&#39;); and work with each entry separately (individually). This example does not describe the entire library, it shows it’s philosophy. It is an attempt to remove “necessary” language formality from programming, leaving only what is needed in everyday programming. The main principle can be summarised as “maximum simplification with maximum flexibility”. Special preference is given to ease and convenience as in my opinion it is simplicity and “humaneness” of the sources is the main factor of rapid development in any language. Motivation for its creation was the PHP language itself, which presents a wide choice of non systemised functions with obscure and intricate names (titles). The library itself is important for people building interactive websites using PHP language who do not appreciate the limitations and lack of flexibility in popular CMS.</p>

 summary : <p>What is sshrunner?It&#39;s a web server that lets you create server profiles, scripts and run those scripts on the selected servers. </p>

<p>How much is it?Although it is LGPL&#39;d, It is not free. </p>

<p>Please pay for the software in one of the two different ways specified here: Blog post on sshrunner </p>

<p>How does it work?It&#39;s quite easy. </p>

<p>Create a list of servers and enter their login information like user, password, host, mysql host, user and password. Create a list of SSH-runnable shell scripts. Run a selected script from (2) to run on servers from (1) automated and display the result back on the web page. Currently ...It&#39;s ugly, but it uses AJAX to execute scripts and show results, a bit of script.aculo.us to spice it up, there&#39;s still tons of work to do on this and hopefully will grow in the near future. </p>

<p>Future ...First improvements will be to authenticate users, encrypt data, manage scripts and servers by user, and manage companies in a hierarchy of users-&gt;companies-&gt;groups-&gt;servers/scripts to make it really usable as a web service (in the sense of a service provided to the public, not literally as a REST web-service resource). </p>

 title : The stasis Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Stasis is a flexible transactional storage library that is geared toward high-performance applications and system developers. It supports concurrent transactional storage, and no-FORCE/STEAL buffer management. </p>

<p>Traditionally, write-ahead-logging schemes have been closely coupled to a relational database or other high-level system, making it difficult to make full use of their functionality without making significant changes to complex and tightly coupled code. Libraries such as Berkeley DB also provide lower level interfaces, but focus on providing a narrow set of highly configurable transactional structures. Stasis focuses on providing applications an easy to use toolkit for building their own transactional structures. </p>

<p>Stasis achieves this by providing clean interfaces between its subsystems. We hope that this will allow for the implementation of self-tuning primitives, reducing the amount of work required to build high-performance storage systems.  Although full redo/undo logging (with nested top actions) is the default, Stasis provides a number of logging modes, including unlogged updates to newly allocated storage.  It is appropriate for both log-structured and update-in-place storage structures. </p>

<p>Current stable releaseWe have not yet released a stable version of Stasis.  However, the 0.8 branch is currently in feature freeze, and is beta quality code.  It is available at: </p>

<p>svn co http://stasis.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stasis-0.8Development (including significant performance enhancements) continues in SVN trunk: </p>

 title : The stasiscl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>StasisCL is an open source, BSD licensed (see License) Perl application that parses WoW combat logs and generates statistics from them. The goal of the project is to generate static HTML reports that you host on your own web server. It should work on TBC logs as well as WLK logs. If you would like an example of what you can expect when you get it working look here: </p>

<p>http://stasisguild.org/sws/sws-patchwerk-1231309416/ </p>

<p>I especially encourage you to look at healing reports and buff reports, which I feel are particularly strong (mostly due to expandability into spells for healing, and uptime for buffs). For example, you can see things like debuff uptime on the boss and spells used by each healer on a tank. </p>

<p>The best way to communicate a feature request or bug report is to open an issue (on the tab above). I&#39;m pretty much guaranteed to remember it since it will stay in the list until I take a look. Read QuickStart to get going on a Mac or other Unix-like system. If you are on Windows, read QuickStartWindows. Make sure to check for updates from the SVN from time to time. </p>

<p>To briefly describe how this all works technically, for those of you interested: the actual &quot;stasis&quot; program does very little aside from gather command line options and glue modules together. Most of the work is done by a set of Perl modules in the &quot;lib&quot; directory, which are designed to be independent enough that you could use them in your own application. </p>

<p>If you&#39;d rather do your own analysis, StasisCL can also convert log files into SQLite databases with a simple and easy-to-query schema, which you can then interact with however you desire. </p>

<p>The following Perl modules are used but not included: </p>

<p>File::Copy File::Find File::Path File::Spec Getopt::Long HTML::Entities File::Tail (only required when using -tail) Many of these probably came with your perl distribution. The rest should be on CPAN.</p>
 summary : <p>The State of the USA (SUSA)The State of the USA (SUSA) will offer the public a web-based information source that presents key national indicators.

<p>DevelopmentNow for the good stuff.  The SUSA &quot;guerilla&quot; development project is completely iterative in nature.  Some of the philosophies employed on this project are: </p>

<p>Agile Modeling http://www.agilemodeling.com/ TFD/Test Driven Design http://www.agiledata.org/ Service Oriented Architecture Open Source Initiative Usage of Content Aware Data Storage/Unstructured Data Retrieval and many more... The goal is to put a foundational architecture in place so we can attack many of the issues facing a project of this magnitude with empirical evidence, not speculation.  What issues are policy related?  What issues do we need to tackle with regard to data standardization?  What issues do we have to solve in organic software?  The project is meant to remain 100% iterative and scalable.  We add bodies and functionality only as necessary and as our product owners, the SUSA Product Advisory Group, dictates.   </p>

<p>The overall philosophy is to separate problem space and form a solution to a complex problem through the aggregation of simple ones.

 title : The stdcuda Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introductionstdcuda is a library of data-parallel algorithms with an STL-like interface. </p>

<p>What is stdcuda?stdcuda is designed to allow CUDA programmers convenient access to parallel algorithms through a templated interface similar to the C++ Standard Template Library. stdcuda provides a suite of commonly encountered data parallel algorithms which may be used as primitive building blocks of larger systems. </p>

<p>Featuresstdcuda exposes the high-performance computing capabilities of emerging CUDA-capable parallel platforms through a familiar serial programmatic interface. A few of these features include: </p>

<p>vector_dev provides convenient device memory management similar to std::vector. scan provides an efficient parallel prefix-sum. reduce provides an efficient parallel reduction. All functions are implemented through header files, without the hassles common to linked libraries. ExamplesManaging Device Arrays with vector_dev// vector_example.cu

 summary : <p>Stikked is an Open-Source PHP Pastebin, with the aim of keeping a simple and easy to use user interface as well as providing an example application for the CodeIgniter framework which stikked is based upon. (Stikked also uses the jQuery Javascript Library.) </p>

<p>Stikked allows you to easily share code with anyone you wish. Stikked was created for the following reasons: </p>

<p>IRC and Private Chats were spammed. Pastebins were ugly. Pastebins were confusing. Pastebins were messy and not thought through. </p>

<p>Stikked rethought code collaboration, by making it easy to paste code. We offer a TextMate Bundle meaning you can paste to Stikked right from TextMate. </p>

 title : The stompcli Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The stomper Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>StomperAuthor: Oisin Mulvihill </p>

<p>IntroductionThis is a python client implementation of the STOMP protocol.  </p>

<p>The client is attempting to be transport layer neutral. This module provides functions to create and parse STOMP messages in a programatic fashion. The messages can be easily generated and parsed, however its up to the user to do the sending and receiving. The STOMP protocol specification can be found here: </p>

<p>http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol/ </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at the stomp client by Jason R. Briggs. I&#39;ve based some of the &#39;function to message&#39; generation on how his client does it. The client can be found at the follow address however it isn&#39;t a dependancy. </p>

<p>http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/projects/stomppy </p>

<p>I now test using the basic MorbidQ broker http://www.morbidq.com/ which is easy-installable &quot;easy_install morbid&quot;. MorbidQ uses stomper as a dependancy so it will be automatically downloaded and installed with MorbidQ. </p>

<p>You can still use alternative brokers such as ActiveMQ. The server runs in java, however its fairly standalone and easy to set up. The projects page is here http://activemq.apache.org/ </p>

<p>ExamplesBasic UsageTo see some basic code usage example see &quot;example/stomper_usage.py&quot;. The unit test &quot;tests/teststomper.py&quot; illustrates how to use all aspects of the code.  </p>

<p>Receive/SenderThe example &quot;receiver.py&quot; and &quot;sender.py&quot; show how messages and generated and then transmitted using the twisted framework. Other frameworks could be used instead. The examples also demonstrate the state machine I used to determine a response to received messages. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also included &quot;stompbuffer-rx.py&quot;  and &quot;stompbuffer-tx.py&quot; as examples of using the new stompbuffer module contributed by Ricky Iacovou. </p>

<p>Version History0.2.2OM: Applied patch from esteve.fernandez to resolve &quot;&amp;nbsp;Issue 4&amp;nbsp;: First Message not received&quot; in the example code. OM: I&#39;ve updated the examples to use twisted&#39;s line receiver and got it to &quot;detect&quot; complete stomp messages. The old example would not work if a large amount of data was streamed. In this case dataReceived would be called with all the chunks of a message. This means that it would not be correct for it to attempt to unpack and react until the whole message has been received. Using twisted&#39;s line receiver looking for the \x00 works like a charm for this. OM: This release integrates the bug fixes and the optional stompbuffer contributed by Ricky Iacovou 	 </p>

<p>RI: Removed the trailing &#39;\n\n&#39; inserted by Frame.pack(). I believe that adding this is incorrect, for the following reasons: </p>

<p>http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol gives the example:</p>

<p>CONNECT
<br/>login: 
<br/>passcode:</p>

<p>^@</p>

<p>and comments, &quot;the body is empty in this case&quot;. This gives the impression that the body 
<br/>is *exactly* defined as &quot;the bytes, if any, between the &#39;\n\n&#39; at the end of the header 
<br/>and the null byte&quot;.</p>

<p>This works for both binary and ASCII payloads: if I want to send a string without a 
<br/>newline, I should be able to, in which case the body should look like:</p>

<p>this is a string without a newline^@</p>

<p>... and the receiver should deal with this.</p>

<p>This impression is reinforced by the fact that ActiveMQ will complain if you supply a 
<br/>content-length header with any other byte count than that described above.</p>

<p>I am also unsure about the newline after the null byte as nothing in the protocol says 
<br/>that there should be a newline after the null byte. Much of the code in StompBuffer 
<br/>actively expects it to be there, but I suspect that *relying* on a frame ending &#39;\x00\n&#39; 
<br/>may well limit compatibility. It&#39;s not an issue with Stomper-to-Stomper communication, 
<br/>of course, as the sender puts it, the receiver accepts it, and ActiveMQ happily sends 
<br/>it along.RI: StompBuffer has had a few fixes; most notably, a fix that prevents a content-length &quot;header&quot; in the body from being picked up and used (!). The biggest change is a new method, syncBuffer(), which allows a corrupted buffer to recover from the corruption. Note that I&#39;ve never actually seen the buffer corruption when using Twisted, but the thought occurred to me that a single corrupt buffer could hang the entire message handling process. RI: Fixed the typo &quot;NO_REPONSE_NEEDED&quot;. I&#39;ve changed it to NO_RESPONSE_NEEDED, but kept the old variable for backwards compatibility. RI: I&#39;ve modified the string format in send() to include the &#39;\n\n&#39; between the header and the body, which I think is missing (it currently has only one &#39;\n&#39;). RI: Added CONNECTED to VALID_COMMANDS so syncBuffer() does not decide these messages are bogus. RI: Added new unit test file teststompbuffer which covers the new functionality.</p>

 title : The strongbind Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>StrongbindStrongbind is a library that enables strongly typed data binding for Windows Forms, making data binding much more declarative, reducing the risk of runtime errors, and enhancing the development of data bound applications.  </p>

<p>Read more about Features, Usage, Advantages, and Drawbacks for an introduction to various aspects of Strongbind. For more detailed information on Strongbind, please see Documentation. </p>

<p>MotivationOne of the main issues with Windows Forms data binding is the lack of strong typing when declaring bindings. The properties that are bound are specified as strings, due to the lack of a facility for sending &quot;property references&quot; as an integral part of the platform and language. This makes the declaration of data bindings unnecessarily slow and error prone, since no IntelliSense support can be offered, and a mistyped property name will not be detected at compile time. </p>

<p>SolutionStrongbind solves this problem by providing a declarative, strongly typed manner of declaring data bindings, where you declare a bindable source and target, and bind the two together. Strongbind also declaratively supports binding behavior specification, event hooking, and so on. </p>

<p>Strongbind also implicitly enables IntelliSense support for data binding, since the declaration of bindings is strongly typed. </p>

<p>The project is still in an early stage, so both the API and the inner workings are subject to change. Please test it and report bugs and/or feature requests.</p>

 title : The stubl Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Stubl is a transition mechanism for providing a basic level of IPv6 connectivity to individual nodes on a private network. All that&#39;s required is a single Linux server with an IPv6 /64 subnet routed to it. </p>

<p>The Stubl server consists of a Linux kernel module (stubl.ko) for handling the tunnel packets, and an HTTP server (stubl_http.py) for calculating clients&#39; addresses and providing tunnel setup instructions. </p>

<p>The main advantage of Stubl is that it allows a user on the network, running any major OS, to get a working IPv6 connection with nothing but a few lines of shell commands. This makes it very easy for developers to start getting familiar with the protocol, with minimal administrative overhead.</p>

 title : The styx-n-9p Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Styx® and 9P2000® are different names for the same file service protocol, called Styx by Inferno and 9P2000 (or just 9P) by Plan 9 from Bell Labs.  We sometimes use the different names to distinguish the authentication scheme: public-key (Styx) or shared-secret (9P) but the scheme is actually separate from the protocol. </p>

<p>The protocol is connection-oriented, and maintains state on both client and server. It has only 14 simple messages, with a simple and obvious representation on the network (ie, decoding is straightforward). </p>

<p>In Inferno and Plan 9, the client-side interface is provided through ordinary system calls: mount, open/create, read/write, close. Outside those systems, library support is needed, and this project is intended to distribute and maintain some of those. </p>

<p>The first is a Java client, allowing concurrent access to a remote Styx server, including the use of Inferno public-key authentication.  (Secure key storage must be provided separately.)</p>
 title : The su2rad Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This repository hosts the su2rad.rb exporter script for Radiance and other daylight related scripts for SketchUp. </p>

<p>su2rad.rbThis script exports your scene and perspective to a Radiance scene description. It is still under heavy development but the download link to the right (&#39;featured&#39;) provides a snapshot with the most embarrassing bugs removed. </p>

<p>If you want the bleeding edge try the svn repository. </p>

<p>version 1.0.alpha </p>

<p>You can find the download package in the &quot;Featured&quot; list to the right. Documentation can be found on my sites.google.com pages. </p>

<p>shadowsequence.rbThis script creates images of an animated time sequence. It is intended for shadow studies of building sites. </p>

<p>Advanced features allow you to color and arrange images automatically. For this you need ImageMagick and Ghostscript on you machine. I have updated this script recently to handle file paths better and had to remove the label feature temporarily. A major update with interactive JavaScript interface is planned but I have not time frame yet. </p>

<p>location.rbThis little script replaces the &#39;location&#39; dialog in the poor man version of Sketchup. It does not offer a selection of countries and cities but at least you can easily set the longitude and latitude of your scene. This functionality is also included in the su2rad package. </p>

<p>I have not prepared a download package for this script. It is a single file download available here via SVN download. Right click the link and save the file as Ruby source text (.rb), then copy the file into the &#39;Plugins&#39; folder of your Sketchup installation. </p>

<p>NewsKick It, Digg it </p>

<p>December 3rd, 2007Today I added a syntax highlighting library from Wilco Bauwer. It does a colourful job of syntax highlighting lots of programming languages. </p>

<p>November 22nd, 2007The codebase for Subversion Reports has undergone a complete rewrite to remove the dependency on invoking the &quot;svn log&quot; command. The solution now directly queries the repository using webdav over http. </p>

<p>The new solution runs on either the Microsoft .Net framework or Mono and has been tested on both. </p>

<p>One of the main goals of Subversion Reports has been to support remote repositories. It is one of the few projects capable of doing this as most rely on being hosted on the same box as the repository being queried. </p>

<p>A new demonstration of the capabilities of the application is now available at: http://www.subversionreports.org/ where the application is hosted on a Debian Linux virtual server under Mono on Apache. </p>

<p>June 15th, 2007I uploaded a demo of the solution to http://grenade.me.uk/ The demo currently points to the subversion repository here at Google Code. I&#39;ll update it soon to accept the URL of other repositories.</p>

 title : The sulley Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Sulley is a fuzzer development and fuzz testing framework consisting of multiple extensible components. Sulley (IMHO) exceeds the capabilities of most previously published fuzzing technologies, commercial and public domain. The goal of the framework is to simplify not only data representation but to simplify data transmission and target monitoring as well. Sulley is affectionately named after the creature from Monsters Inc., because, well, he is fuzzy. </p>

<p>Modern day fuzzers are, for the most part, solely focus on data generation. Sulley not only has impressive data generation but has taken this a step further and includes many other important aspects a modern fuzzer should provide. Sulley watches the network and methodically maintains records. Sulley instruments and monitors the health of the target, capable of reverting to a known good state using multiple methods. Sulley detects, tracks and categorizes detected faults. Sulley can fuzz in parallel, significantly increasing test speed. Sulley can automatically determine what unique sequence of test cases trigger faults. Sulley does all this, and more, automatically and without attendance.</p>

 title : The superdouble Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Overflows and underflows can be an issue in some calculations (such as calculating the probability of phylogenetic data). There are arbitrary precision libraries (notably GMP), but sometimes the use of them may be overkill. I made a &quot;Superdouble&quot; class consisting of a single header file. An object of that class is basically a number in scientific notation (i.e., 5.2 x 10^28), where the mantissa (5.2 in the example) is a long double and the exponent (28) is an integer. This allows the number to have the same precision as a long double but have an exponent that can take values much greater in magnitude than for a normal long double, dramatically reducing the chance of overflow or underflow. Basic operators (&lt;&lt;, , +, -, /, +=, =, -=, /=, ++, --) and natural log have all been written to work without requiring conversion back to double. There are also functions to convert from and to double. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a biologist not trained in computer science, so the code is naively-written though useful. If you have suggestions to improve it, please contact me (bcomeara@nescent.org) and perhaps sign up as a developer.</p>

 title : The supersnippets Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The superswitcher Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SuperSwitcher is a (more feature-ful) replacement for the Alt-Tab window switching behavior and Ctrl-Alt-Left/Right/Up/Down workspace switching behavior that is currently provided by Metacity.</p>

<p>When running, use the &#39;Super&#39; key (also known as the &#39;Windows&#39; key) to switch between windows and workspaces. This key is usually found between the Ctrl and Alt keys on the keyboard.</p>

<p>Super-Tab works just like Alt-Tab does (with and without Shift), but also:</p>

<p>Super-Up and Super-Down cycles through all windows in the current workspace in a fixed order (as opposed to Alt-Tab or Super-Tab, whose list of windows is ordered by most-recently-used first - which is good if you want recently used windows, but it&#39;s clumsy to cycle through, for example, all three or four windows in the one workspace). Hold down Shift to re-order the list instead of switching between windows.</p>

<p>Super-PageUp and Super-PageDown maximize and minimize the active window (or restores them if it was already maximized or minimized). Super-Ctrl-PageUp and Super-Ctrl-PageDown do this to all windows on the current workspace, not just the active one.</p>

<p>Super-Left and Super-Right cycles through your workspaces. Hold down Shift to also bring across the active window into the new workspace. Hold down Shift and Ctrl to bring across all windows from one workspace to the next. Unlike Metacity&#39;s Ctrl-Alt-Left and Ctrl-Alt-Right, this &#39;loops&#39; so that, when you get to the end of the list, you cycle back to the start.</p>

<p>Super-F1 moves to workspace number 1, Super-F2 moves to workspace number 2, and so on, up to Super-F12. Again, hold down Shift to bring across the active window, and both Shift and Ctrl to bring across a flock of windows, just like as described above.</p>

<p>Super-Insert creates a new, empty workspace. Again, hold down Shift to also bring across the active window (if there is one) into the new workspace.</p>

<p>Super-Delete deletes the current workspace, if it is empty. Super-Shift-Delete will delete all empty workspaces, down to a minimum of one.</p>

<p>Super-Escape closes the active window. Super-Ctrl-Escape will close all windows on this workspace.</p>

<p>Whilst holding down Super, typing regular letters or numbers will show you only those windows whose titles match that pattern. Pressing Enter (whilst still holding down Super) will then cycle through the matches, regardless of which workspace you are on. For example, if you have a lot of windows open, and you want to get to your web browser window that is showing planet.gnome.org, then hold down Super, then type &#39;p&#39; &#39;l&#39; &#39;a&#39; &#39;Enter&#39; and then release the Super key. Shift-Enter goes in the other direction than Enter (i.e., up and left with Shift, versus down and right without Shift). Use the Space key to enter multiple word fragments, such as &#39;pla gn&#39;, to further refine your search.</p>

<p>Finally, when holding down Super, click on image or text representing a window or a workspace to activate it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s based on the following technologies: </p>

<p>.NET 3.5 ASP.NET MVC 2 MVC Contrib LINQ to SQL Windsor IoC Container Built using TDD with the following tools: </p>

<p>NUnit Rhino Mocks A working instance of Suteki Shop is maintained here: http://sutekishop.co.uk/ Note that this is somewhat out of date now. </p>

<p>The first commercial customer of Suteki Shop is Jump the Gun, a &#39;Mod&#39; fashion retailer based in Brighton, UK: http://www.jumpthegun.co.uk/ </p>

<p>The main author is Mike Hadlow. His blog can be found here: http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com, and here are some Suteki Shop related posts </p>

<p>The suteki shop discussion group is here: http://groups.google.com/group/sutekishop </p>

<p>How to get the project workingGet the MVC Framework http://www.asp.net/MVC/ and install it. Get the latest version of the code (use a subversion client such as http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/). Alternatively you can download a copy of the source here: http://code.google.com/p/sutekishop/downloads/list but it will most likely be an older version. You should be able to build Suteki.Shop.sln and run all the unit tests. Create a new database called SutekiShop In the Database folder in the root directory of the source you will find a collection of numbered SQL scripts. Run them into a database called &#39;SutekiShop&#39; in numbered order. If you don&#39;t use windows integrated security and an instance called &#39;SQLEXPRESS&#39;, change the connection string in Windsor.config defined in the IConnectionStringProvider service. You should be able to hit Shift-F5 and the web site should run without any errors You can log in as administrator using email=&#39;admin@sutekishop.co.uk&#39; password=&#39;admin&#39;. The login link is on the bottom right of the home page. </p>

<p>You can then add categories by clicking on the category menu and then &#39;add category&#39; You can add products by clicking on a category and then add product. </p>

<p>Happy shopping!</p>

 title : The swiftdiscipline Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Summary is unformated and is not updated... please view the SwiftDiscipline post on MMOwned for more information on the project. </p>

<p>What is SwiftDiscipline? Basically, SwiftDiscipline is an addon that attempts to make it easier for GMs on ArcEmu servers to, well, discipline their players. Swiftly. </p>

<p>How do I use SwiftDiscipline? SwiftDiscipline is very easy to use, with uncluttered prompt windows and an intuitively laid out UI that leaves little question as to how it functions. The main method of working with the addon is via the eight command buttons that you will find on the bottom right of your screen. Clicking on these buttons will open a window that takes the information required for the command you selected, such as Kick Reason, Ban Duration, Port Location, etc. Clicking on a button with a player targeted will prefill the player name box with the target&#39;s name. </p>

<p>An alternate, yet equally convenient method of using SwiftDiscipline is via the dropdown menu buttons that the addon adds to the BlizzardUI UnitPopup dropdowns (these are the menus that appear when you right-click on someone&#39;s name in chat or when you right click on your target&#39;s portrait). This is especially useful when you&#39;re receiving a flood of &quot;OMFG REZZ MY HERO PL0x&quot; whispers, as you can just right click on their name and select Resurrect. </p>

<p>The addon also has a couple other tricks up its sleeve, check out the feature list and the screenshots following it below. </p>

<p>SwiftDiscipline&#39;s Features </p>

<p>-Adds a sort of control panel for commonly used functions such as Kick, Account-Ban, IP-Ban, Mute, Teleport, Paralyze, and Revive. </p>

<p>-Prefills player name with currently selected target. </p>

<p>-Hooks into the Blizzard UnitPopup dropdown menus to provide a quick way to Kick, Ban, Appear, Summon, Port, or Resurrect a player. </p>

<p>-Allows for up to 10 &quot;Saved Reasons&quot; for player kicks. These saved reasons are predefined, editable strings of text that you can use to quickly provide a reason for a kick such as Vulgar language, exploiting, use of caps-lock, etc. </p>

<p>-Counts the number of times a player has been kicked in a session (by any GM) and suggests a temporary ban when the kick count gets high. </p>

<p>-Completely removes the need for a GM to use .playerinfo to get a player&#39;s account name or IP address for a ban, SwiftDiscipline does this automatically, and also warns you if the player you&#39;re about to ban has GM permissions. </p>

<p>-Comes with a basic stat tracking feature, allowing you to see how many kicks, bans, revives, ports etc. you&#39;ve done since the addon was installed. </p>

<p>-Sends a server-wide announcement for player bans (can be disabled). </p>

<p>-Intuitive, easy-to-use prompt GUI system with uncluttered windows and a small, unobtrusive main window that doesn&#39;t take up unnecessarily large amounts of screen space. </p>

<p>-Includes a minimize feature that reduces the main window&#39;s size to a very small, thin bar. </p>

<p>FINAL NOTE This addon is designed to work with ArcEmu commands and system messages. It may not work with other emulators or newer revs of ArcEmu if commands or system messages (like pinfo output) are changed. Testing and development for this addon was done on ArcEmu r579, and support for the &quot;new&quot; GM command set in r583 is also included. It MIGHT work with Aspire or other Ascent based emulators but only if the commands and the system GM messages have not changed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SwitchControl exposes one binding: </p>

<p>NSValueBinding; a BOOL wrapped in an NSNumber DependenciesMac OS X Leopard 10.5 Objective-C 2.0 SwitchControl is dependent on a framework (AmberKitAdditions) contained inside another one of my projects Amber found at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework which must be available at compile time.  </p>

<p>Using the ControlThe easiest way to use SwitchControl is to instead download Amber.framework which contains all my custom UI controls and the AppKit additions required to use them. </p>

<p>Otherwise you can download the code for this project alone using an svn:external property to pull the &#39;code&#39; subdirectory, i.e. http://switchcontrol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/application/code, you could also pull the &#39;code&#39; directory from a branch or tag. </p>

<p>Building the ControlIf you checkout the entire project and are building it from source then the Xcode project must be able to find the Amber Xcode project. </p>

<p>It expects to find the Amber working copy at the same level as it&#39;s own working directory. It must also be able to link the framework; the two projects should either share their build products directory, or you must set custom header search paths. See here http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2008/Sep/msg00268.html for more information. </p>

 summary : <p>What is Synapse?Synapse is a self-service web interface and database supported and maintained by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Library, providing access to an inventory of the published output of our researchers and clinicians. As the name implies, Synapse is the user’s point of “connection” to publications authored by Memorial Sloan-Kettering staff. You can search for specific author names or by journal title, keyword and other fields. The search will return a listing (bibliography) of the publications that you can browse, print, export or connect to the fulltext of specific articles. </p>

<p>The term “synapse” was coined in 1897 by the English physiologist Charles Sherrington with help from some of his colleagues. They derived the coined term from the Greek work “synaptein” meaning to fasten together. The interface for Synapse allows users to submit, search, and retrieve relevant information about MSKCC published literature that can be used for research, creating bibliographies, completing core grant applications and updates, journal club sessions, and future publications and presentations. </p>

<p>How Synapse is populatedSeveral bibliographic databases are used to systematically populate the references being stored in Synapse; additional metadata and individual references are manually added.</p>
 summary : <p>The FilmApart SyndicatorThe FilmApart Syndicator (FS) is a video blogging tool designed to serve serialized video programs to clients via web browsers and video content aggregators. </p>

<p>FS provides an infrastructure for a text and video blog for a single program with multiple episodes.  The FS does not host the content within it&#39;s own system, but provides the RSS feeds and embedded blog web pages that allow clients to access the program&#39;s files hosted on public storage facilities like The Internet Archive, YouTube, and torrent swarms (the only use case scenario where the file is served from the FS system). </p>

<p>Video formats served by FS are transcoded from a single upload to The Internet Archive.  The Archive identifier of this file is entered into the FS&#39;s database.  The file is downloaded to the system, transcoded into all formats, torrents are generated of each individual file, and the files are upoaded to the Archive.  A version of the file suitable for upload to YouTube will be generated and transferred to the YouTube system to provide   for embedded playback in a browser page. </p>

<p>The blogging engine has a node structure so that blog entries may be either plain text or embedded media formats. </p>

 title : The tabulasoftmed Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tabula is a Java Web Framework, comprised of several subprojects, such as a server and GUI tools. Right now there is a preview version of the server available for Windows and Linux. </p>

<p>The framework is based on SOFEA, removing the UI responsibilities from the server to other applications. The server itself deals with business logic and persistence, among other issues. In order to expose this functionality, there is a REST service layer, implemented with the RESTlet library. I&#39;ve created a simple XML format specification to declare and configure the services, allowing for runtime changes. The implementation supports Java and Groovy classes as request handlers. </p>

<p>The main goal of the framework is to reduce app restarts during development as much as possible, while providing a simple environment for prototyping and developing small to medium applications. </p>

<p>The controller layer uses another project of mine, named JTAction. It&#39;s a library for handling composite actions. Each action is a state machine, where each state is built by several steps. Actions are cached but can be changed via a remote refresh request. Action steps can be implemented with Java or Groovy scripts. JTActions can also be used as request handlers for the service layer. </p>

<p>There is also a custom AOP system which defines an approach to create, edit and apply aspects to JTActions through a rule system based on request parameters. This allows to add for example logging and authorization aspects, and is already used to automatically refresh the REST service layer when any PUT, POST or DELETE methods are performed on the stored rest service configuration objects. </p>

<p>The persistence layer uses a custom persistence abstraction layer. Ideally, I would have used JPA, and though I like it, it doesn&#39;t support real time changes such as redefining groovy classes. The implementation uses Neodatis ODB, an object based database system, which is still under development, but is showing great promise. </p>

<p>There will be SWING-based editors for some of these components, such as configuring REST services, building JTActions from groovy scripts and applying aspects. The goal is to ease development of the whole application, hide any XML details from the developers, instead showing a configuration interface, and support runtime changes of the application. </p>

<p>The whole purpose of the project right now is to try out different ideas and approaches to web development. As such, currently this is a proof of concept and should not be used for deployment.  </p>

<p>Due to time restraints, some aspects of the framework may be changed or removed. The source code also reflects the time restraints unfortunately, but as this is something I plan of using and developing along the way, it will improve.</p>

 title : The talc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The language Talc is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy programming. It is simple, straightforward, and aimed at aficionados of the C family, despite its Pascal-inspired declarations. Particularly notable features are static typing, mostly C-like syntax, and the all-important  curly braces. (As Dennis Ritchie said, &quot;C’s intellectual influence on the semantic design of new languages has been  small. On the other hand, it has influenced notation: even pseudo-code these days tends to contain curly braces.&quot;) </p>

<p>If you want a convenient language for quick little jobs, love  the C family, like  static  typing, dislike Perl’s complexity and obscurity, dislike Python’s needless breaks from tradition, have been disappointed by Ruby’s irregularities, and most of all don’t want to throw the baby of good compile-time error checking out with the bathwater of verbosity of simple tasks, Talc may be the language for you.</p>

 summary : <p>Tamanoir is an image processing tool to remove small dust from picture scans. </p>

<p>This introduction in French/Cette introduction en français: IntroductionFrancais  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Most of the flatbed scanners do not provide optical ICE, but only digital ICE, which is very slow, sometimes with weird artefacts on picture, and not available with every scanning software (espescially when running Linux).  </p>

<p>The aim of Tamanoir is to pre-process images with a simple and fast user interface to remove most of the small dusts. It detects the small objects on the picture, then tries to propose a correction by cloning another part of image in the neighbour of the dust. The user can skip or apply the correction.  </p>

<p>With this processing, 90% of the dusts are removed. </p>

<p>Then you can correct the remaining dusts and fibers on another image manipulation tool (Gimp, Lightroom, Krita...). </p>

<p>Please read HowToUseTamanoir </p>

 summary : <p>In the last ten years, corporations have grown exponentially in complexity. This has been driven by the increase in sophistication and globalization of theirs markets. This growth has been matched by the growth of their IT infrastructure. The most important element in this growth of enterprise integration needs is the message, its creation, processing, transportation and storage. Taxy develops a simple but powerful integration framework to process this fundamental organizational element. </p>

<p>What is the message?The message is the fundamental unit of enterprise communication, it is an order, a trade, an email, a contact, an appointment, a line in a log file, critical system information, a document, it&#39;s in fact anything that needs to be communicated. Messages have to be created or extracted, translated, filtered, analyzed, routed, transmitted, stored, and displayed. All these actions form the integration circuitry of an enterprise. Taxy is the framework to build these circuit parts and is the tool to do wiring. </p>

<p>What is Taxy?It supplies developers with a framework to develop the needed integration circuitry. 
<br/>Powerful SimplicityWith Taxy integration, systems are far quicker to develop than with other more heavy and complex products. Because of the elegance and simplicity of its foundation, integration systems built with TaXy systems tend to be 3-5 times smaller than their equivalent built with systems such as Mule. This results in a major reduction of TOC. Taxy integration systems are easier to maintain. The simple and elegant methodology results in clean design. Taxy is an extremely versatile. It abstracts the underlying technology. Allowing a mix of programming languages, platforms and protocols to exits. This style of legacy leverage again reduces TOC and time to production. Implementation costs and infrastructure expenses are kept to a minimum. Taxy object-oriented paradigm is the most powerful and easy to use of any integration framework. It creates dynamic, resilient circuitry whose behavior can be adapted at run-time. This allows for unobtrusive releases and seamless integration. Again powerful simplicity allows for rapid development of more complex integration systems.  PortabilityTaxy is available on an incredibly wide range of hardware and software platforms. This includes the usual suspects: Sun, Intel, IBM, Microsoft Windows variants, Macintosh OS variants and all Unices. However, Taxy has also found its way into a wide range of less well-known platforms, including PDAs and set-top boxes. By abstracting the technology, Taxy plays well with all programming languages. Taxy systems can be extended using C, C++, Java, python, erlang, scheme, etc! It can also be embedded in programs written in these languages. Taxy comes with the usual barrage of adapters which support almost all standards, FIX, swift, CORBA, COM, SOAP, XML, XML-RPC, MQ,  and so on. Due to the simple design, Taxy works well with other third-party adapters. Taxy provides the option for integration with low-level APIs for both the Windows and Unix platforms, allowing applications to be highly platform compatible.</p>

 title : The team-calendar Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>THE PROBLEM: In this time and age, team members often find themselves struggling to find times to collaborate on group projects. Individual schedules are often fraught with professional, academic, and personal commitments, making the task of organizing a team&#39;s project schedule both cumbersome and time-consuming. Currently people expend valuable time arranging common meeting times, working around increasingly complicated schedules that are often liable to change, or squander time and resources when they lose track of project deadlines, resulting in late contributions that set back everyone. The Team Calendar is the solution. </p>

<p>THE SOLUTION: A web-based system, team members will create individual accounts that will be grouped together under a project. Members can upload their schedules to the database, and the program will return a listing of available times for meetings, based on who must be in attendance. Members may also create events and deadlines to be shared with the rest of the group, as well as send reminders and &#39;drag-and-drop&#39; tasks to others. </p>

<p>THE TARGET CUSTOMER: The Team Calendar is ideal for any individual who works in a team-based environment. The specific customer for the prototype is Dr. Bryan Mendez of UC Berkeley&#39;s Space Sciences Laboratory, Center for Science Education division. Dr. Mendez works with his group to promote space science education and public outreach. However, other testers include students working in teams on both class projects and extracurricular activities. </p>

<p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: The Team Calendar may include the following features: - Member registration to see group events and individual shared events. - Drag-and-drop tasks to other team members. - Send reminder messages and check status of messages (opened, unopened). - Update individual calendar with events and have group updates reflect on others&#39; calendars. - Update individual calendar with personal commitments, and share available times with others. - Comparison of team members&#39; free times to find meeting times. - Mark % completion on a project or task, along with status comments. - Customizable colors and categories. - Click and drag calendar events. - Confirm attendance to meetings and other events. </p>

<p>TESTING: Testing will be accomplished by requiring beta testers (group members, and representatives of the target group) to utilize the calendar over the course of one week, testing each individual feature at least three times. A more specific testing regimen will be devised once software features are finalized. Throughout development, each feature will also be extensively tested for usability and security. Demonstration can also be accomplished by running each of the program&#39;s unique features, such as the drag-and-drop tasks or automatic potential meeting time calculator. </p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION: The project requires knowledge of databases, such as MySQL, and several web languages such as PHP, AJAX, Ruby on Rails, JSP, and HTML. Students should be able to adopt the basics of the languages easily, especially if they already have experience working with databases. Conversely, one of the greatest challenges will come from providing proper security and authentication levels, which will require more sophisticated knowledge. Overall, the different features can be completed by people with varying levels of programming expertise and UI interest. Furthermore, should time be an issue, certain features may be excluded without detracting from or affecting the product&#39;s core functionality.</p>
 title : The teambuilder Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The idea for this project originated when I became a soccer convener for the U7 boys soccer teams in my community.  </p>

<p>The community club presented me with a spreadsheet of 160 names that I needed to split into teams based primarily upon proximity to local soccer fields and some other selection data that they store. </p>

<p>I had to manually look at where each of those players were on a Google map, by typing in their address, and then figure out who was closest to a particular playing field. </p>

<p>After dividing the 160 kids into 5 teams, I had to share fragmented spreadsheets with four other coaches. After that, some parents requested to be moved to other teams, there were a lot of spreadsheets being emailed back and forth. </p>

<p>Some of the interaction could have been improved just by all of the coaches using Google spreadsheets. Even then, I found personally found it tricky to manage so much data like that on my macbook. </p>

<p>So - this project&#39;s aim is to develop a web application that will hopefully centralize the management of the teams for all coaches. </p>

<p>I aim to develop using a Flex RIA, and deploy on Google App Engine. The project will use a lot of Google services: </p>

In this case, a telnet client library will be very helpful. Such a library is very handy in Perl, Python and Ruby. But I googled it a lot and failed to find one in Common Lisp. So I decided to port the Telnetlib from Python to Common Lisp. Why port from Python? Because I am more familiar with Python and have use its TelnetLib before :-)  </p>

<p>The functionality of this library is almost the same as Python&#39;s one.  But the interface is a little different.</p>

 title : The templatemaker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>templatemakerGiven a list of text files in a similar format, templatemaker creates a template that can extract data from files in that same format. </p>

<p>The library is written in Python, but the underlying longest-common-substring algorithm is implemented in C for performance. </p>

<p>How to downloadGo to the &quot;Downloads&quot; page and download the latest version, 0.1.1. </p>

<p>Newer (but not necessarily stable) code is available via Subversion on the &quot;Source&quot; page. </p>

<p>Example usageHere&#39;s a sample Python interactive interpreter session: </p>

<p># Import the Template class.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from templatemaker import Template</p>

<p># Create a Template instance.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = Template()</p>

<p># Learn a Sample String.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.learn(&#39;this and that&#39;)</p>

<p># Output the template so far, using the &quot;!&quot; character to mark holes.
<br/># We&#39;ve only learned a single string, so the template has no holes.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.as_text(&#39;!&#39;)
<br/>&#39;this and that&#39;</p>

<p># Learn another string. The True return value means the template gained
<br/># at least one hole.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.learn(&#39;alex and sue&#39;)
<br/>True</p>

<p># Sure enough, the template now has some holes.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.as_text(&#39;!&#39;)
<br/>&#39;! and !&#39;</p>

<p># Learn another string. This time, the return value is False, which means
<br/># the template didn&#39;t gain any holes.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.learn(&#39;fine and dandy&#39;)
<br/>False</p>

<p># The template is the same as before.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.as_text(&#39;!&#39;)
<br/>&#39;! and !&#39;</p>

<p># Now that we have a template, let&#39;s extract some data.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.extract(&#39;red and green&#39;)
<br/>(&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;)
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.extract(&#39;django and stephane&#39;)
<br/>(&#39;django&#39;, &#39;stephane&#39;)</p>

<p># The extract() method is very literal. It doesn&#39;t magically trim
<br/># whitespace, nor does it have any knowledge of markup languages such as
<br/># HTML.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.extract(&#39;  spacy  and underlined&#39;)
<br/>(&#39;  spacy &#39;, &#39;underlined&#39;)</p>

<p># The extract() method will raise the NoMatch exception if the data
<br/># doesn&#39;t match the template. In this example, the data doesn&#39;t have the
<br/># leading and trailing &quot;&quot; tags.
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.extract(&#39;this and that&#39;)
<br/>Traceback (most recent call last):
<br/>...
<br/>NoMatchDocumentationSee README.TXT in the distribution for full documentation. </p>

<p>StabilityThe library is functional, but this is my first time writing C code since college. As such, it may or may not have buffer-overflow issues. I&#39;m hoping a C expert will step in and audit the code. </p>

<p>Do not use this in a production setting just yet. </p>

<p>Mailing listThe mailing list is hosted by Google Groups. </p>

<p>Academic stuffThanks to some kind contributors, I&#39;ve learned that this sort of technology goes by several names in the academic community: </p>

<p>Wrapper induction (&quot;wrapper&quot; is a formal term for &quot;screen scraper&quot;). Every paper I&#39;ve found about wrapper induction takes a &quot;supervised&quot; approach -- that is, it requires human-labeled input. My goal with templatemaker is to be entirely unsupervised. Wrapper generation. (This seems to be a synonym for &quot;wrapper induction.&quot;) Information extraction (IE). Template detection. See these search results for hours of reading material. </p>

 summary : <p>Acerca deTequila-framework es un framework que sirve para generar código fuente de forma no intrusiva, lo cual quiere decir que no es necesario @notar una sola clase, mover una sola línea de código o crear un archivo de configuración dentro del proyecto para generar código fuente dentro del mismo. La forma de generar código fuente es haciendo un archivo de configuración spring y realizar las plantillas necesarias a partir de los objetos generados por el framework. </p>

<p>MotivaciónLa mayoría de los generadores de código fuente de hoy en día generan proyectos desde cero pero no generan código fuente en proyectos ya existentes. Las estructuras de los proyectos generados es rígida ya que está basada en el generador de código. Retomar el proyecto para hacerle nuevos cambios se torna difícil ya que debemos entender la estructura del proyecto generado por el framework. Si quiere hacer nuevos cambios sobre el código fuente del código generado a veces es muy difícil ya que no sabemos la estructura de los archivos generados. La mayoría de los generadores de código lo hacen a partir de un &quot;pojo @anotado&quot; lo cual en muchos casos no es práctico ya que no se cuenta con una jvm que soporte annotations (menor a la versión 5.0) o en ocasiones no lo permite la estructura lógica del proyecto. Muchos generadores de código fuente permiten realizar plantillas para generar código fuente personalizado el problema radica en que los objetos a utilizar dentro de las plantillas no son intuitivos para el usuario y se vuelve un problema crearlas. ObjetivosGenerar código fuente dentro de proyectos existentes en diferentes ide&#39;s como Netbeans, Eclipse, Intellij, etc. La estructura del proyecto no se ve modificada después de la generación del proyecto No es necesario entender la estructura del proyecto ya que es nuestro proyecto y la conocemos No es necesario anotar ningún pojo, ni crear archivos de configuración dentro del proyecto. La idea del framework no es reutilizar plantillas ya hechas si no crear sus propias plantillas cada que lo necesite. DesignPhaseIdeas</p>

<p>TER LOGOLogo en bref...Qu&#39;est-ce que le Logo?Fondamentalement le Logo est un langage de programmation. Plus important, le Logo est un langage conçu pour favoriser l&#39;apprentissage, selon les idées développées par le psychologue suisse Piaget Jean, en particulier comment une personne construit sa connaissance au fil d&#39;interactions continuelles avec les objets et phénomènes environnants. </p>

<p>Contrairement à une idée reçue, le Logo est un langage de programmation complet; il a pour vocation principale l&#39;enseignement. Il est utilisé dans l&#39;enseignement primaire, secondaire et supérieur, un peu partout dans le monde. </p>

<p>Le nom Logo vient du mot grec Logos qui veut dire mot. Ce nom a été choisi parce que, lors de sa conception, un des objectifs était de pouvoir manipuler les mots et les phrases d&#39;une langue. </p>

<p>Le Logo favorise l&#39;apprentissageDepuis sa naissance fin des années soixante, le Logo a évolué pour tirer profit de l&#39;évolution du matériel, en particulier celle de l&#39;ordinateur personnel. Cependant la philosophie Logo et les bases du langage restent les mêmes; le Logo n&#39;est pas lié à une mode ou à une tendance momentanée. La valeur intemporelle du Logo réside dans le fait qu&#39;il favorise le développement de la réflexion formelle et la résolution de problème, qu&#39;il encourage les étudiants à explorer, à apprendre et à réfléchir. </p>

<p>La pratique du Logo constitue une sensibilisation générique aux différents concepts informatiques qui permettra aux enfants d&#39;être des utilisateurs éveillés des outils informatiques d&#39;aujourd&#39;hui et de demain. </p>

<p>Comparaison avec d&#39;autres langagesLe Logo est un dialecte du Lisp, à l&#39;origine un langage dédié à la recherche. Comme ses grands frères du monde professionnel (Common Lisp et Scheme), c&#39;est un langage dont le pouvoir d&#39;expression est élevé, bien plus que d&#39;autres mieux connus, comme le C, le Pascal et le Java. Cela veut dire que, en règle générale, il est plus facile et plus rapide de traduire ses idées en Logo que dans un langage comme le C. Pour ces mêmes raisons et d&#39;autres, le Lisp et le Scheme consituent deux des rares bonnes altrenatives au Logo, du moins dans l&#39;enseignement secondaire. </p>

<p>La syntaxe du Logo, c&#39;est-à-dire les règles à appliquer pour écrire des instructions valides, est simple et uniforme. De fait en Logo, il n&#39;y a qu&#39;une seule règle syntaxique (en termes techniques : la règle de l&#39;application d&#39;une procédure). </p>

<p>Le Logo est un langage interactif : l&#39;utilisateur dispose d&#39;un feed-back immédiat, s&#39;il le souhaite. </p>

<p>Cette interactivité combinée à une syntaxe simple fait du Logo un langage facile et amusant à apprendre. </p>

<p>Pour la réalisation de ce projet, nous avons décidé d&#39;utiliser le langage de programmation Java. L&#39;interface sera, tout d&#39;abord, sous forme d&#39;applet  Java afin de pouvoir ensuite l&#39;implémenter sur une page Web. Par la suite nous implémenterons notre projet sous forme d&#39;application JAVA, ce qui permettra de pouvoir la télécharger, et de pouvoir la lancer sans aucune connexion internet (en local). </p>

<p>Etant donné que LOGO est un langage de programmation destiné à l&#39;apprentissage et à l’enseignement, nous allons simplifier l&#39;interface graphique pour les plus jeunes et permettre au plus expérimentés de pouvoir rajouter certaines options dans l&#39;affichage (par exemple, l&#39;affichage d&#39;un bash pour visualiser les traitements effectués par l&#39;interprète LOGO).</p>

 title : The termite Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>AboutTermite Scheme is a variant of Scheme intended for distributed computing. It offers a simple and powerful concurrency model, inspired by the Erlang programming language, which is based on a message-passing model of concurrency. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a paper about Termite. </p>

<p>It runs on top of Gambit-C, a very nice Scheme system developed by Marc Feeley at Université de Montréal.  </p>

<p>LicenseTermite is distributed under the terms of the LGPL license. </p>

<p>Installation#1 Install the latest version of Gambit-C </p>

<p>#2 Get the latest Termite and put it in Gambit&#39;s lib/ directory </p>

<p>$ cd /usr/local/Gambit-C/current/lib
<br/>$ svn checkout http://termite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ termite#3 Copy the tsi script to Gambit&#39;s bin directory (optional) </p>

 title : The terse-ppcre Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TERSE-PPCRE allows you to use create CL-PPCRE parse trees using a simpler syntax that is still S-expression based.  It tries to mimic perl string regular expression syntax as closely as possible, although in some cases the lisp reader prevents us from doing that (for example, we can&#39;t use a period to represent any character, so ANY is used instead). </p>

<p>Hopefully using the RE macro shouldn&#39;t be too much more verbose than straight perl regex strings, and much easier to combine and manipulate. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I noticed DEFPATT (http://www.cl-user.net/asp/libs/DEFPATT) only after writing this.  Oh well, having too many libraries is not exactly Common Lisp&#39;s problem. </p>

 title : The tesseractic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tesseractic is a library for the .NET Framework that generates bit-mapped scatterplots from two-dimensional data. </p>

<p>Tesseractic is written in pure managed C# 2.0.  It uses System.Drawing for bitmap rendering and System.Windows.Forms for bitmap display. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t use Mono, but Tesseractic should work on Mono.  Furthermore, the SWF dependency could easily be replaced by GTK# or some other GUI. </p>

<p>It is currently in a pre-alpha stage: unstable and incomplete.  Use at your own risk, etc.  On the plus side, the code base is small enough that its easy to read, debug and hack on.</p>

 title : The test-dept Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The purpose of Test Dept. is to be an ease-of-use framework for unit testing. It is suitable for pure C-code and consists of assertions macros and makefile snippets for automated tests. Test suites are standalone binaries following a certain specification and can thus be used by arbitrary test-runners. </p>

<p>Stubbing and mocking for the C language is not as easily done as for object-oriented languages. Therefore a supportive framework may be of use. Test Dept. tries to be such a framework. </p>

<p>Please read the documentation!</p>
 summary : <p>Contains basic test classes used by several google open source projects., </p>
 title : The test-libraries-for-java Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The library allows the creation of tests based on real specifications.  The developer provides properties of code (think: &quot;for all X sqrt(X) &gt; 0&quot;) and Test::Quick generates tests automagically to prove this assertions.  </p>

 summary : <p>Welcome to Project Tether! We&#39;re the development team for MoonPy, an open source remake of the classic strategy game Moonbase Commander.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for someone to play MoonPy against, meet with us on channel #moonpy on irc.freenode.com!  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Announcements03/09/10 - MoonPy now available on playdebGood news for debian based linux users, MoonPy has been uploaded onto playdeb and is now available in their repositories. Instructions for adding the playdeb repositories can be found here. Special thanks goes out to c_korn for doing the packaging for us. </p>

<p>03/01/10 - MoonPy 0.8.05 releasedMoonPy 0.8.05 has been released and available on the downloads page. This is primarily a performance enhancement release. All unnecessary code, including PIL, has been removed so you should see better performance with less random artifacts. Animated tethers have been implemented allowing players to more easily identify parent/child relationships between units. A few other minor bugs have also been fixed. </p>

<p>02/23/10 - MoonPy 0.8.01 emergency updateMoonPy 0.8.00 was found to be not saving logfiles correctly. Although not a major issue by itself, the logfiles are crucial to helping the devs find and eliminate bugs. This has already been patched and the updated version uploaded onto the downloads page. </p>

<p>02/23/10 - Unofficial IRC chanel designatedTo help players find each other we have set up an unofficial IRC channel #moonpy on irc.freenode.com until a more permanent solution can be found.  </p>

 summary : <p>Project TetriSiege began life as a course project at UCSD. It was presented as a &#39;finished&#39; product at the end of that course, and to some extent worked. </p>

<p>However, the code base was a mess and the game was in fact quite riddled with bugs. For that reason several members of the original development team have undertaken to re-develop the game in order to clean up the code, remove many of the existing bugs, and enhance the playability of the game substantially. </p>

<p>We will be looking to incorporate more people as the project grows, so if you like what you see, please contact us. </p>

<p>XCodeMateLatest release: 0.9a </p>

<p>This textmate bundle bridges the gap between XCode&#39;s powerful code-completion capabilities and TextMate&#39;s elegant interface.  It&#39;s no longer necessary to sacrifice elegance for functionality. </p>

<p>Currently the bundle is in the alpha state and getting ready to be rolled over to the TextMate bundles repository.  Many have found it quite useful.  If you&#39;d like to enable XCode in textmate, and already have XCode installed, you can quickly try it out. </p>

<p>Most notably, the bundle provides: </p>

<p>Code completion, with parameter inspection, for a variety of languages (ruby, javascript, python, perl, objective-c) Visual Type Hierarchies Some refactoring tools </p>

<p>RequiresRequires Tiger, XCode, and TextMate.  Ruby is required for some commands, but not all. </p>

 summary : <p>The Teyjus system is an efficient implementation of the higher-order logic programming language Lambda Prolog. The main strength of Lambda Prolog, a language developed by Dale Miller and Gopalan Nadathur, is the support it offers for what is known as lambda tree syntax, a new and effective way to view the structure of complex syntactic objects such as types, formulas, proofs and programs. Lambda Prolog provides this support by using lambda terms as data representation devices and by including primitives for probing such terms in logically meaningful ways. The new features present in the language raise several implementation challenges that have been addressed in collaborative work between Nadathur and his students and colleagues. The name &quot;Teyjus&quot; actually stands both for a project and for a class of compiler and virtual machine based realizations of Lambda Prolog arising from the research carried out within this project. Underlying the most recent version of the Teyjus system is a new and significantly improved virtual machine that has been designed by Xiaochu Qi as part of her doctoral dissertation work  at the University of Minnesota. This virtual machine extensively exploits a special form of higher-order unification known as pattern unification. </p>

<p>It is important to understand that Thousand Parsec is not a game by itself: it is a framework for creating a similar group of games. Some of the games, such as our first demo game MiniSec, are developed by the Thousand Parsec developers themselves. In the near future we hope that other developers will create their own games using Thousand Parsec. </p>

<p>Some examples of games from which Thousand Parsec draws ideas are Stars!, VGA Planets, Master of Orion, and Galactic Civilizations. These games are often called 4X strategy games from the main phases found in the games: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. If you haven&#39;t heard of them, other games which are a bit similar include Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Starcraft. </p>

<p>Thousand Parsec includes everything you need for </p>

Templates, exceptions, and much better error handling. It is also fully documented in doxygen. It is really cool because this version let&#39;s you interface tiny the exact same way as before or you can choose to use the new &#39;ticpp&#39; classes. All you need to do is define TIXML_USE_TICPP. It has been tested in VC 6.0, VC 7.0, VC 7.1, VC 8.0, MinGW gcc 3.4.5, and in Linux GNU gcc 3+. </p>

 summary : <p>Tiger Book とはどんな本かコンパイラの作り方を解説した有名な本に Tiger Book (modern compiler implementation in C) というものがあります。&quot;トラ本&quot;と呼ばれるだけあって、トラの絵が目印です。プリンストン大の Andrew Appel という先生が書いた本です。 </p>

<p>Appel 先生のホームページから、本の表紙を引用しておきます。 </p>

<p> </p>

<p>どんな内容が載っているかこの本には C 言語を使ってコンパイラを作る具体的なやり方が書いてあります。コンパイラの教科書と言うと、理論が多めで &quot;具体的にどうやって実装すればいいか&quot; を説明してくれるものはほとんどありません。いっぽう、Tiger Book では、どんなデータ構造やどういう関数が必要か、といったとても細かいことまで教えてくれます。 </p>

<p>どうやって読むのがよいかTiger Book では実際に読者がプログラムを書きながら読むことを推奨しています。本を読みながらプログラムを書いていくと、読み終わるころにはお手製のコンパイラができているといった具合です。またそれぞれの章末には、その章でやったことを復習するための練習問題があります。 </p>

<p>このページの目的は何かこのページは、もともとは私が Tiger Book を読みながら書いたコンパイラのソースコードを管理するためのページです。つまり、個人的なメモに過ぎないのですが、同じ目的を持った人にとって役に立てばと思い公開しました。練習問題を解くときに、どうしてもわからない箇所があったりした場合に参照していただけるとうれしいです。逆に、ここのプログラムは間違っているのではないか、などの指摘をいただけると助かります。 </p>

<p>---</p>
 summary : <p>ObjectiveTo create an action rpg with simple mechanics that, when combined, allow for complex gameplay. This mainly means experimenting beyond typical combat, leveling, questing and magic systems, to achieve a less repetitive, funnier, and challenging game. To include many pedagogical and educational quests and habilities, by requesting the player to learn certain real-world skills and knowledge, ranging from simple algebra and puzzles to a bit of physics and logic (all of which, of course, should be logically integrated in the game background so as to not appear out of place, that is, there will be an in-game reason for you to &quot;learn&quot; such things, for example the magic system). We do not care about graphic quality beyond what is needed to make all the above functional. </p>

<p>Right now, it&#39;s just a sprite moving (8 directions) in a single tiled map, with animations for walking, some monsters that follow or escape from the player and that&#39;s pretty much it. (and sadly i&#39;m not really having much time to spend on this proyect so..)  </p>

 summary : <p>Brief InfoThis will be my first attempt to create a decent web app. How’s that for brief? </p>

<p>Case StudyI didn&#39;t want to create another blog app for practice again. I like a big goal and then take my time to build a solution. So I have designed the following FICTIONAL case study for myself: </p>

<p>CircleCircle is privately owned, retailer of video game products and personal computer (PC) entertainment software. It sells new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software, and related accessories and other merchandise. It has exactly 5 employees and 1 location situated in the heart of Brooklyn and within walking distance of 2 elementary schools, 1 middle school, and 1 high school. </p>

<p>Business has been booming for CircleCircle, kids love the convenience, product variety, and experience enough to visit everyday. The store windows are usually furnished with fantastic posters of popular game titles and display boxes of consoles. However, fast growth is hard to manage and CircleCircle hasn&#39;t been able to properly keep up with technology. In fact this past Christmas it lost out a third of his loyal customers to the god awful BuyBest due to an improperly placed order that increased its&#39; inventory of &quot;Barbie goes to the mall&quot;, rather then &quot;Smash Brothers vs. Street Fighters&quot;.  </p>

<p>The task now is for CircleCircle to find someway to properly record information without resorting to a 10 year old cash register and Excel. Sure, its not at the level of a public offering, but business is growing enough to hire another 10 people and maybe open up another shop. It is extremely important for a small company to grow properly and something as ridiculous as misplacing an order is just not acceptable.  </p>

<p>The solution that I propose is a super simple ERP for a super small company who want to grow beautifully.</p>
 title : The time-comparisons Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Time Comparisons Rails pluginProvides for chronological comparisons between Time, Date and DateTime objects using before?, after? same_time?, same_time_or_before?, same_time_or_after?, within?, outside? and compare_time methods. </p>

<p>This provides a more readable alternative the , =, == and  methods for time comparison, and allows for comparing a Time with a Date/DateTime (the built-in methods return an ArgumentError in this case.) </p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<p>present.same_time? DateTime.civil(2007, 6, 7, 4, 30, 30)
<br/># =&gt; true</p>

<p>past.before? present
<br/># =&gt; true</p>

<p>past.same_time_or_before? present
<br/># =&gt; true</p>

<p>past.after? present
<br/># =&gt; false</p>

 summary : <p>Tinos is shared memory parallel ray tracer; if instructed, it is capable to distribute rendering among multiple threads in order to accelerate it on  multi-processor machines. Tinos could be compiled to utilize OpenMP API or alternatively POSIX threads library for multi-threading support. </p>

<p>Tinos works as a regular UNIX filter accepting scene description in NFF format of the SPD (Standard Procedural Database) scenes on standard input and emitting image in PPM format to standard output. Tinos implements both bounding volume hierarchy and voxel grid schemes for speeding up rendering calculations; scheme to be used could be selected when launching renderer. </p>

 title : The titanpanel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WelcomeWelcome to the Titan Development Team Google Code site. This will be our home for the Titan Panel source code as well as several of our own Titan Panel PlugIns.  </p>

<p>What Is Titan PanelTitan Panel is an AddOn for the MMORPG World of Warcraft.  Titan Panel adds information bars to the top and/or bottom of the Blizzard UI window. </p>

<p>To Do List: Please be patient as this is being updated </p>

<p>1. A fully-supported, completely rewritten follow-on to Titan Panel. It could be called something like Titan I/C (Interface bar/Control panel). </p>

<p>2. A team of programmers/testers responsible for the addon so that users would not have to wait for a response when they need help. Though not a programmer, I&#39;d be more than happy to help where I could. </p>

<p>3. A Titan page on this server as the &quot;Home&quot; of the mod. Here, the team would post the mod and plugins they author, invite other authors to submit their plugins for testing and &quot;certification&quot;, field questions, complaints, and suggestions from users as well as other authors, etc. Basically, one-stop shopping for Titan. </p>

<p>4. Remove all built-ins except for the following controls: AutoHide, Scale, Transparancy, and Volume. </p>

<p>5. Rewrite the other built-ins as separate plugins. </p>

<p>6. All coding by the Titan team and all files &quot;certified&quot; by them would include full comments. See the files contained in Gold Tracker-- each section of code explains what it does. (I&#39;d like to see that author as part of the team). </p>

<p>7. Standardized naming convention and standardized version number for the main addon and all &quot;certified&quot; plugins, such as Titan I/C Ammo 2.3 r1 for the first release for Wow version 2.3; Titan I/C Sets 2.4 b1 for the first beta for Wow version 2.4; etc. </p>

<p>8. Version numbers should display not only on the Addons screen in Wow, but also on the Titan options menu and in each plugin&#39;s menu. </p>

<p>9. A read-me file in each Titan download containing directions for installation and use. </p>

<p>10. User choice of 1 or 2 top bars, 1 or 2 bottom bars, or 1 top and 1 bottom bar. </p>

<p>11. All plugins should be drag-and-drop anywhere on either bar. </p>

<p>12. New categories: Interface (plugins for standalone mods); Profession (plugins for class, weapon, and trade skills); Social (plugins for groups, guilds, friends, and chat); Goods (plugins for bags, bank, and inventory); Information (plugins for quests, feedback, maps, etc.); and Miscellaneous (plugins thad don&#39;t fit in one of the other categories and those not coded with a category) </p>

<p>13. After the main mod and plugins are rewritten, begin recoding orphaned, but still useful, Titan plugins and coding new plugins for standalone mods that exist for FUBAR but not Titan.</p>

<p>T-Lrc-Show（安装包名称为lrcshow）是一个Totem播放器的功能插件。这个插件可以使totem具有搜索、下载并显示歌词等功能。 我们希望它对至少一些热爱音乐的人是有用的。 </p>

<p>这是为totem写的插件，用来显示歌词。 它的工作流程如下： </p>

<p>首先搜索用户指定的歌曲目录或~/Lyrics下的同名歌词文件； 如果找到歌词文件，就显示； 如果找不到，就在网上搜索、下载并显示。 经lmplayer作者同意，下载和搜索歌词部分的代码，我们使用lmplayer的相应代码。 在此表示感谢！ </p>

<p>目前，这个插件功能简单。至于以后会有什么功能，我们还没有想好。不过我们期望它能改善totem的用户体验。 欢迎各位朋友,向我们提出任何意见.我们一定会重视您提出任何意见. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>最新改进：将歌词窗口放进侧边栏也可以选择在独立窗口上显示。版本号为0.0.2。</p>

 summary : <p>Please use GitHub to Checkout the Source!This project hosts the code for the book Pro Web 2.0 Application Development with GWT by Jeff Dwyer.  </p>

<p>An interview about the book and sample chapter on SEO with GWT is available on InfoQ. </p>

<p>Also there&#39;s an interview about the book and the ToCollege.net project at GWTSite.com. </p>

<p>The goal of this book was to end up with more than just trivial examples. Instead, I really tried to write the book that I would’ve wanted to read when I started with GWT. For me, figuring out the GWT basics was simple and pretty intuitive, so this book doesn’t focus very much on the basic UI elements. The tricky bits were understanding how to make GWT fit nicely into the Java ecosystem. Getting it integrated with Maven, Jetty, Spring Security, Hibernate, Sitemesh, best practices for RPC etc.   </p>

<p>With that in mind I’ve built a full-sized web site called ToCollege.net. This is a real site that focuses on helping students with their applications to college. It has a heavy focus on being Search Engine Optimization (SEO) friendly but still having rich AJAX functionality. The source code for the book is right here. You&#39;re welcome to checkout the release 0.1.0 tag which contains the code as of the date of publication, or to checkout the trunk to get the latest GWT 1.5 rc1 code. Either way, there&#39;s about 15,000 lines of source for you to explore, covering everything from Google Gears to OpenID. </p>

<p>The book is essentially a walkthrough of this codebase. It explains how to get the site up and running on your localhost and goes into how the site is built. I hope you enjoy &amp; please avail yourself of the google group if you have any questions. </p>

<p>Cheers, </p>

<p>-Jeff Dwyer </p>

<p>ps Please note that this project is NOT using Google Code anymore. Please checkout the project source on GitHub </p>

<p>git clone git://github.com/jdwyah/tocollege.net.git </p>

<p>Sorry, but I couldn&#39;t take Google Code anymore. Any change to the wiki made me need to reset the entire repository.</p>

 title : The topmod Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TopModTopMod is based on a new paradigm that allows dynamically changing the topology of 2-manifold polygonal meshes. The new paradigm always guarantees topological consistency of polygonal meshes.  </p>

<p>Based on our paradigm, by simply adding and deleting edges,handles can be created and deleted, holes can be opened or closed, polygonal meshes can be connected or disconnected. These edge insertion and edge deletion operations are highly consistent with subdivision algorithms. In particular, these operations can easily be included into a subdivision modeling system such that the topological changes and subdivision operations can be performed alternatively during model construction.  </p>

<p>TopMod demonstrates practical examples of topology changes based on this new paradigm and show that the new paradigm is convenient, effective, efficient, and friendly to subdivision surfaces. </p>

 title : The torrentbarf Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>To start with, here&#39;s why I&#39;m coding torrentbarf - I&#39;ve found that there are a number of problems with the most popular private bittorrent trackers out there.  Among them: </p>

<p>They&#39;re all written in PHP, which is scalable only if designed correctly (torrentbits scripts include a number of library files on every page load, including tracker announces, including stuff that isn&#39;t necessary). Many are based on the torrentbits source code, which is several years out of date and forked into oblivion (so they cannot share any code improvements, and improvements are difficult to create). They are poorly templated (using a hand-crafted templating system). Torrentbarf is written using django, a Python web framework that runs using fastcgi.  Not only does it run faster (the framework is optimized to run high-volume sites on cheap hardware), it is modular (and thus easier to add features to).  It is immune to common errors that plague PHP apps (namely, SQL injections and register_globals). </p>

<p>At the moment, every relative statement in the previous paragraph is a bold-faced lie.  Yes, I&#39;m working with django, and yes, I have a pretty good idea of how trackers work, but no, it is not working yet, and thus no, it is not optimized (although if Psyco is installed on the local machine, support for it has been added to django&#39;s manage.py for this project).</p>

<p>Student Senior Project Due Date: October 2008</p>
 title : The touche Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Touché is a free, open-source tracking environment for optical multitouch tables (FTIR, DI, Lasers). It has been written for MacOS X Leopard and uses many of its core technologies, such as QuickTime, Core Animation, Core Image and the Accelerate framework, but also high-quality open-source libraries such as libdc1394 and OpenCV, in order to achieve good tracking performance. </p>

<p>The Touché environment consists of two parts: A standalone tracking application written in Cocoa, that comes with lots of configuration options as well as calibration and test tools, and a Cocoa framework that can be embedded into custom applications in order to receive tracking data from the tracking application. This way, you can easily experiment with MacOS X technologies such as Core Animation or Quartz Composer on your multitouch table. </p>

<p>Key features include a powerful filter pipeline, an easy-to-use embeddable framework to communicate with the tracker, and output of tracking data via the TUIO protocol, as well as direct output of tracking data to Flash applications. </p>

<p>Touchsmart TUIO is a bridge application for Windows XP/Vista, which can output touch data from Nextwindow API-compatible touch screens in the same formats like Touché. Nextwindow screens are used, among others, on HP Touchsmart PCs.</p>

<p>KeywordBook management, Meta-Language, Ubiquitous, RFID </p>

<p>BackgroundCondsidered, you have hundreds of books, all kinds of, include mathematic, physics, electronics, software engineering, art and music, and you have a lot of friends, whoms most interest is to borrow books from you and seek knowledge. So, how do you mannage your books, did you ever encounter the following problem: </p>

<p>When you looking  for a book for the reference of your paper, but it disappeared, you didn&#39;t know whom you lend the book, and when the book returns. (Time Uncontrollable) For some books, you did know it&#39;s in your office, but you just can&#39;t find it, or it will take you some time to fnd it (10 minites, 20 minutes or longer). (Space Uncontrollable) To satisfy your friends needs, you may make several copys of one book, but after that, most of copy is of little value, and waste your money. (Efficiency) Some times, when your read some books, you got a excellent idea, you want to share it with your friends/students, but you just dident know who read it, and the reader&#39;s review of a certain books (rating, comment, tags, and so on). Also, since you can&#39;t read through all your books, time limited, you want to know the spirit of the unreaded book, but there is no such records. (Effective) </p>

<p>Both Efficiency and Effective problem is the energy problem, the spirit of industiral engineering. Thus, as an industrial engineer, why not use come ready-made technology to setup a system to management our own books, implement the engineering methodology, and deliver us to the convenient living/working environment. Engineering do things. </p>

<p>Objective &amp; MethodologyUsing Meta-Language as the automatic enumeration and reasoning kernelMeta-Language as a executable tool for us to modeling complex system. Using the term of abstract algebra, we could use algebraic operands/operator set and the connection between them to describe the object and process network existed in the aimed system. </p>

<p>Possible object will be: Book content (Unique number, name, tag, comment, review, last borrow/return date, and so on.), Bookcase content, Personal content, ans so on. Possible process will be: Borrow process, Return process, Newbook brought-in process, and review and comment process, and so on. Via the algebraic structure, we can initialize several value function to evaluate which book should recommend to whom, and construct some statistical process to summary some valuable information among the data set. </p>

<p>Using rich web client development framework as control logic and user interfaceVia internet, people may use the personlized and customized computer program without complicated device installation and configuration. Ajax/Flash/SilverServer also provide the rich representation method for user interface. Current possible web development framework: </p>

<p>HTML/XHTML/XML/CSS/Javascript, the basic element of Ajax. PHP, a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. Quick and low cost. ROR, Ruby On Rails, Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. JSF, Java Server Faces technology simplifies building user interfaces for JavaServer applications. Developers of various skill levels can quickly build web applications by: assembling reusable UI components in a page; connecting these components to an application data source; and wiring client-generated events to server-side event handlers. Using the Bar-Code and RFID technique as the physical device implementingDiagram reader Components: a webcam, processing. We use our own identification patterns to identify books. Color and shape of the diagram is used to identify the book. We make the identification patterns as simple as possible so that when new books come in, we can easily add the books to our database. And we can draw it directly by hand and put on the books. We also can organize books in a way that fits to our own demand. For example, let’s assume that current interest of our group is Galois connection then, we can add red circle on the diagrams on the books related to Galois connection. That way we can easily know that whether the book borrowed is relevant for our current interest. RFID Components: RFID reader, RFID tags We use RFID to identify readers. Each reader has his own RFID card to borrow books.

<p> qTracker first alpha release (0.0.6) </p>

<p>I&#39;ve put a first release of qTracker (Qt/S60 port of tracker-py, aimed at the nokia N97), online. It is available on http://qtracker.googlecode.com And as usual, the sis file needs to be signed at symbiansigned. Basic features are now working, gauges, and map display. Maps can be calibrated, and maps from tracker-py are compatible. Currently it doesn&#39;t import ozi or mcx files. Probably in the future these will be supported as well. No track recording, waypoint monitoring or display, these features will follow in a later release. </p>

<p>Oktober 20th 2009: </p>

<p> Started new project: Qt/C++ port of tracker-py  </p>

<p>Due to many instabilities in getting my 0.20 app to work in PyS60 1.9.7, and the limitations in the ui available for PyS60, i&#39;ve started looking at Qt to fill the gap. However, PyQt bindings are not available at this time for S60, and so I&#39;ve moved fully to Qt/C++ at least for the client part of the application (mapviewer/dashviewer). Perhaps I will move to Qt/C++ entirely, since for now it offers a great development environment, and i can do most development on my native Qt for OSX platform. </p>

<p>The codebase of what i have working so far can be found on a new project site: http://qtracker.googlecode.com. </p>

<p>Perhaps in a later phase, I will enable part of the functionality in python as well, i still wish to have a python based plugin structure. </p>

<p>Meanwhile simple versions of a logger and a mapviewer for the N97 are available in the 0.40 svn branch. I use the gpslogger as a server, it automatically starts recording a track in GPX format. The mapviewer communicates with the logger via the properties framework, and is able to show current position on map, and the currently recorded trackpoints. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found the logger to be very useable, and have managed to use it to record almost all the tracks i walked during my last hiking holiday in Austria. Battery life of the N97 beats the N95 by at least a factor 2... where i used to need at least 2 batteries for the N95 to do a day of track recording, for the N97, a single battery was enough for 1 day and some more. </p>

<p>August 20th 2009: </p>

<p> Opened 0.40 branch for port to N97  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Since I recently purchased an N97, and like to use tracker.py on that phone from now on, I decided to create a new branch from 0.30 to port to the new symbian 5th edition platform. This means I have to extend the uiregistry to allow for touch events to be registered, and the layout must be adapted to allow for the bigger resolution. (note that images are scaled down to 25%) </p>

<p>June 30th 2009: </p>

<p> Properties extension for 1.9.x available  </p>

<p>Over the last few months I&#39;ve been diving into the how and what of writing python extensions, initially triggered by the fact that there is currently no Python API to the Charger Status info of the PowerState interface. In the end I ended up writing an almost complete Python interface to the RProperty Publish &amp; Subscribe API. You can find the sources in the trunk, and a sis and zip package in the downloads section. </p>

<p>See for a description this wiki page: http://code.google.com/p/tracker-py/wiki/Properties </p>

<p>May 13th 2009: </p>

<p> PyS60 1.9.4 packages for LocationRequestor and Landmarks available!  </p>

<p>I finally managed to get these packages built properly for PyS60 1.9.4, they are now available in the downloads section. (changes will be forwarded upstream as soon as I created a proper diff) </p>

<p>May 10th 2009: </p>

<p> PyS60CE package available!  </p>

<p>Have been playing with PyS60CE (https://launchpad.net/pys60community), trying to get tracker to work. My current 0.30 branch gives lots of problems, so I moved back to 0.20, wich after a little tweaking of both seems to work fine now. Advantage of using this method is that I can easily extend/tweak the included components. This platform includes miso iso misty, so I had to tweak the tracker code a little, also I could not find the source code of envy, so I added the needed calls to the miso module myself. A sis file which includes the PyS60 interpreter, the needed python components, and the tracker application has been uploaded to the downloads section: http://code.google.com/p/tracker-py/downloads/list (beware that it uses default UID&#39;s in the testrange, so it could conflict with an already installed PyS60 CE installation. You could probably fix that with ensymble). </p>

<p>May 5th 2009: </p>

<p> Update  </p>

<p>Spring has come to my area, and the weather has been great the last few weeks. I&#39;ve been on several short hikes, and bicycle tours, and my need for some new tracker features is growing again ;-) Time to merge some code I received during the Xmas holidays, time to mature 0.30 to a releasable version, and time to look at what the pys60 community has been up to over the last few months: Pys60 1.9.4 has been released, a community version is available, Qt for S60 has been released, and hopefully a PyQt is on the way... As soon as the weather goes bad, I&#39;ll be hacking on tracker again ;-) (looking outside, that could be as early as this evening...) </p>

<p>Januari 12th 2009: </p>

<p> Update  </p>

<p>Christmas holidays are over, however, due to the weather here, I&#39;ve spent little time working on tracker. It&#39;s been freezing here, and for the first time in 12 years canals and lakes are frozen enough to go ice skating, which is one of my favorite sports, especially on natural ice. Perhaps the ice will be gone in a week or so, but until then, I&#39;ll be spending little time behind my computer... </p>

<p>November 26th 2008: </p>

<p> v0.20 vs v0.30  </p>

<p>Progress on v0.20 has been slow lately, this is not because I am not working on tracker anymore, however, it is due to the fact that I have started work on v0.30, and seem to be much more motivated to work with that ;-) Anyway, for v0.20 a new release is still due, there&#39;s only one more thing I want to fix, which is in the route monitor code. Currently it uses timestamps since the internal format does not store names. This is not convenient, so I want to switch to storing and using route names if they are present in the imported route. </p>

<p>October 30th 2008: </p>

<p> Progress  </p>

<p>It&#39;s about time for another release, tracker is almost ready for beta1 with the upcomming 0.20.7 release. Implementation of the Route Monitor code is done, however, I don&#39;t want to release without at least having tested this feature at least once or twice. Watch this space, the release is imminent! </p>

<p>In other news, I&#39;ve started to play around with some ideas I had for implementing a plugin framework, you can find it in the 0.30 branch. Nothing special yet, but if you like to play with the code, take a look at app/example.py, plugin/timer.py and plugin/clock.py. This is an example of how the plugins can interact with a main program which implements a databus to communicate with the plugins. </p>

<p>Tracker v0.20.6 5th alpha version released! </p>

<p>This is mostly a bugfix release. See the ReleaseNotes_0_20_6 and  v0.20 pages for more information. New features are the gauge options for clock/time, and user modifyable proximityalarm script </p>

<p>October 1st 2008: </p>

<p>Feature Poll: Which feature would you like to see in Tracker.py? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve putt up a poll on my homepage where you can vote for your favorite feature. Please vote for the feature you would like to see in the next release of tracker here: Poll </p>

<p>Tracker v0.20.5 4th alpha version released! </p>

<p>This is mostly a bugfix release. See the ReleaseNotes_0_20_5 and  v0.20 pages for more information. New features are the gauge options for speed/altitude/distance/waypoint </p>

<p>September 8th 2008: </p>

<p> No news is good news?  </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s been a week since the last release, and I would like to have pushed another update today, however, I&#39;ve been struggling with the pys60 forms implementation, and thus am a bit behind schedule. Also, the coming two weeks, I&#39;m on holiday, so I won&#39;t have much time to work on the new features. My plan is to release one last alpha version with the gauge options in, then if I find no major bugs, it will be time for a first beta release. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, please do let me know what you think of the software, and especially what you think it still lacks. Also bug reports are very welcome! </p>

<p>September 1st 2008: </p>

<p>Tracker is chosen as one of the featured apps on Croozeus.com! </p>

<p>On croozeus.com you can find a lot of tutorials and example code for pyS60, and every 10 days or so, they put a PyS60 application on display. This time it is Tracker &amp; PyCamera. Take a look here: http://croozeus.com/blogs/?p=22 </p>

<p>Tracker v0.20.4 3rd alpha version released! </p>

<p>This is mostly a bugfix release. See the ReleaseNotes_0_20_4 and  v0.20 pages for more information. </p>

<p>August 25th 2008: </p>

<p>Tracker v0.20.3 2nd alpha version released! </p>

<p>This is mostly a bugfix release. See the ReleaseNotes_0_20_3 and  v0.20 pages for more information. </p>

<p>August 21st 2008: </p>

<p>Tracker v0.20.2 1st alpha version released! </p>

<p>After more than a month of working on this redesign, I now consider version 0.20.2 ready for public release. See the v0.20 page for more information. Do consider this software &#39;alpha&#39; quality. I&#39;ve tested this as much as I could in every day use, but probably the features I don&#39;t use on a daily basis will still cause problems. A sis package is available in the downloads section, you need to get it signed at symbiansigned.com to get it to work. (For required modules/other software see the v0.20 page)</p>

 summary : <p>The TractoR (Tractography with R) project includes R packages for reading, writing and visualising magnetic resonance images stored in Analyze, NIfTI and DICOM file formats (DICOM support is read only). It also contains functions specifically designed for working with diffusion MRI and tractography, including a standard implementation of the neighbourhood tractography approach to white matter tract segmentation. A shell script is also provided to run experiments with TractoR without interacting with R. Using TractoR you can easily </p>

<p>Convert DICOM files from your MR scanner to Analyze/NIfTI format (see ScriptGroups#File_reading_and_conversion). Preprocess diffusion MR data to calculate tensor metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and principal directions (see Preprocessing). Run probabilistic tractography using single seed points or one or more masks (see ScriptGroups#Conventional_tractography). Segment specific tracts in groups automatically using neighbourhood tractography (see PNTTutorial and HNTTutorial). Remove false positive tracts using a model of tract shape variability (see PNTTutorial#Visualising_and_interpreting_results). Create graphics to visualise image slices or maximum-intensity projections (see ScriptGroups#Visualisation). Please note that TractoR is research software and has not been approved for clinical use. The software is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but comes with no warranty whatsoever. </p>

<p>General queries or problems may be sent to the users&#39; mailing list, while bugs and other specific issues may be reported using the Issues tab above. Please describe any problem as fully as possible. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>News(2010-03-11) TractoR version 1.4.0. is now available. New features include automatic B-matrix/gradient vector rotation to compensate for subject motion, gradient scheme caching, group mapping and new visualisations. Full details are in the Changelog. </p>

<p>(2009-11-10) Version 1.3.0 of TractoR is now available. This version adds a new method for rejecting false positive streamlines using a PNT model, which substantially improves tract segmentation; and includes a set of tests to ensure that TractoR is functioning properly on your system. There are also various minor enhancements, as usual, and these are documented in the Changelog. </p>

<p>(2009-08-21) TractoR version 1.2.0 has just been released. It includes seven new reference tracts for both HNT and PNT, as well as DICOM performance improvements and various other minor enhancements. As ever, details are in the Changelog. </p>

<p>(2009-07-03) Documentation aimed at existing R users, which describes the R packages provided by TractoR, as well as how to write new TractoR-compatible R scripts for use with the command line tractor shell script, is now available. </p>

<p>(2009-06-15) TractoR version 1.1.0 has been released. This version contains a number of improvements to various aspects of the software, including support for a more general variant of the standard PNT tract model. Full details are in the Changelog. </p>

<p>(2009-05-29) Updates to the documentation, particularly the HNT and PNT tutorials, have been made to reflect the current state of the software. Additional information about reference tracts has also been added. </p>

<p>(2009-05-14) The &quot;tractor.base&quot; R package is now available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). It can be found here, or through your favourite CRAN mirror (once updated). This allows R developers to use the TractoR functions for reading, writing, manipulating and visualising magnetic resonance images in their own code. A short introduction to TractoR for R users will be made available here soon. </p>

<p>(2009-02-18) The tractor-users mailing list can now be joined by anyone. This list/group is for any discussion relating to the software. Announcements of new versions of TractoR are also made to the list. </p>

<p>(2009-02-13) TractoR version 1.0.0 has been released. New features in this version include &quot;unsupervised&quot; neighbourhood tractography (NT), a set of standard reference tracts for both heuristic and probabilistic NT, and more flexible conversion of DICOM-format files. As usual, the Changelog has full details on the changes since the last beta version. Although this is no longer a beta version, please remember that TractoR is research software and comes with no warranty. Dropping the &quot;beta&quot; label reflects mainly that the structure of the package has stabilised somewhat.</p>

 title : The transdb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>OverviewDjango&#39;s field that stores labels in more than one language in database. </p>

<p>Just working on newforms-admin branch. </p>

<p>Installing and usingInstallation Download, unpack and copy files to ${PYTHON_PATH}/site-packages/transdb (or anywhere else if you know what you&#39;re doing) </p>

<p>Create your models: </p>

<p>from transdb import TransCharField, TransTextField
<br/>[...]</p>

<p>class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>  [...]
<br/>  my_char_field = TransCharField(max_length=32)
<br/>  my_text_field = TransTextField()If you need to use in models in a more advanced way: </p>

<p>from transdb import TransDbField
<br/>from django.conf import settings
<br/>from django.utils.translation import get_language
<br/>from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify
<br/>[...]</p>

<p>class MyModel(models.Model):
<br/>  [...]
<br/>  my_char_field = TransCharField(max_length=32)
<br/>  my_text_field = TransTextField()
<br/>  slug_field = models.SlugField(editable=False)</p>

<p>  def __unicode__(self):
<br/>    return self.my_char_field</p>

<p>  def save(self):
<br/>    self.slug_field = slugify(self.my_char_field.get_in_language(settings.LANGUAGE_CODE))
<br/>    super(MyModel, self).save()
<br/>[...]Use as any other field in templates: </p>

<p>[...]
<br/>{{ object.my_field }}</p>

<p>[...]And that&#39;s all, enjoy! </p>

<p>SerializationDue to technical reasons, serialization on models with TransDb fields has some specific restrictions. </p>

<p>Django comes with two serialization formats, xml and json. </p>

<p>TransDb requires two diferent methods when serializing, one that serializes information for all languages (for example for saving data as fixture). Other method should just return the current language (serialization for ajax processing). </p>

<p>Probably will change in the future, but now TransDb applies a method depending on the format, so </p>

<p>Use xml format for including all languages in serialization objects (and use TransDb serializer, see below).  User json format for returning just the current language in serialization objects. </p>

<p>For using TransDb serializer add next lines to your settings.py file: </p>

<p>SERIALIZATION_MODULES = {
<br/>    &#39;xml&#39;: &#39;transdb.xml_serializer&#39;,
<br/>}Migration from non-translatable fields (and previous versions of TransDb)There is a wiki page MigrationProcedure that covers this subject. </p>

<p>Techincal informationInternally data is stored in database as a string in dictionary format, for example: </p>

<p>u&#39;{u&#39;en&#39;: u&#39;This is english&#39;, u&#39;ca&#39;: u&#39;Això és català&#39;}&#39;Field uses a subclass of unicode class, adding a raw_data attribute to store the string with all languages, and implementing the get_in_language(language) method to allow access to a diferent language (diferent from the user&#39;s current language). </p>

 title : The treefrog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tree frogA starting point for your .NET development treeTree frog is a solution for generating a simple .NET development tree starting point. It can be extend or used out-of-the-box. It automatically takes care of setting up a build file, the solution structure and adds some useful tools used when developing, among other things. It is based on a structure I have used in several projects running unit test, code coverage and continuous integration. The background for creating this project is because it is boring to always having to set up the project structure when starting on a new project.  </p>

<p>Why you should try out Tree frog: </p>

<p>it creates solutions targeted against .NET 3.5. it uses MSBuild as the build script. it sets up solutions adding tools like autofac, nunit, moq and partcover. in most cases you don&#39;t have to do anything else with the build script than add projects. following the structure in the project, you can build the solution from everywhere (as long as the .NET framework 3.5 is installed) </p>

<p>A beta release of this project is available in the download tab. </p>

<p>Usage:    Example: Example: TreeFrog_console default c:\temp TestProject </p>

<p>It only contain on solution package at the moment, and that is the &#39;default&#39; package </p>

<p>At the moment there is not much documentation available, but it will be soon.</p>
 summary : <p>Treetree is a header-only C++ library that implements a generic tree-structured container class according to STL conventions, as well as properly overloaded operator&gt;&gt; for input and operator&lt;&lt; for output. </p>

<p>The underlying data structure generalizes a doubly linked list - in addition to previous and next pointers, tree nodes contain a third pointer to the list of their children. The implementation is efficient, and the API is expressive. Treetree is useful for representing anything that one would use S-expressions for in Lisp (inference trees, programs, etc.). </p>

<p>You can iterate over the contents of a tree in pre- or post-order, iterate over the children of a particular node only, or iterate over leaves only. The same options are available for iteration over subtrees (e.g. the subtrees of f(g(x, y) z), in pre-order, are f(g(x, y) z), g(x, y), x, y, and z).</p>

 summary : <p>Just my projects, </p>
 title : The trowindps Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The troyworks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThere are roughly 5 branches/projects. </p>

<p>controls  &lt; ui widgets apps  &lt; some heavier weight apps, like an asynchronous test framework, useful for working with network and statemachines. dev &lt; - the main classes, collections, utilities and framework examples  test HistoryThe codebase started as code I privately used frequently, then my team used frequently.  I put it on google when I went freelance (as troyworks) , and it&#39;s helped keeping it on google, as the team and contributes to this project come from all over the world, and I&#39;m a firm believer in open source. </p>

<p>The codebase covers a wide range of different things. While many parts exist in other projects on the web, some had to be recreated due to license differences (e.g. I can&#39;t use GPL in some commercial projects, and strongly prefer MIT), some due to philosophy differences (many libraries coming from AS2 linger in it&#39;s paradigm), some were inspired by wanting to just know how to do it. </p>

<p>This latest incarnation is a port of the Actionscript 2.0, and structured to be more maintainable as we get into Flash10, Actionscript 3.0+.   Converting the framework from AS2 to AS3 has been timeconsuming, given how different the languages are. The core is solid, some aspects like the Controls still have much work to be done. </p>

<p>99.9% of the code base is Pure AS3, so can be used in Flash or Flex or AIR development. Since there are no dependencies on Flex there is occasionally some overlap with features that exist in Flex, but on the brightside there is far less code in the framework.  At present there is no dependencies on Flash10 Vector, new rotations etc, but support is planned in 2009, in many cases this will maintain backwards compatibility with Flash9. </p>

<p>GoalsThere are many independent overlapping goals for this project.  The first and formost is making my day to day life easier and reducing reinvention of the wheel for my team. </p>

<p>On one level it&#39;s a grab bag of independent parts/goals (data collections, utilities, prototyping, tweening, layout, etc) they as much any spoon or fork. The goal is to do the job necessary and be unobtrusive. Mix and match however needed. </p>

<p>Another higher level is a framework for building interactive projects faster, easier to skin, easier to prototype. Much of this is enabled by the flowcontrol control. </p>

<p>Ontop of that are Controls and Applications.  Controls can be visual (e.g. buttons, autocomplete), or non-visual.  Applications and Examples being more stand alone. </p>

<p>The UI components tend to be small, with a focus on ease of skinning, typically by runtime binding. e.g. a UI.swf (no script) and a script.swf (no graphics), involving using ADDED to stage and instance name for binding, and faciliating iterated development, going from a wireframe to a momentum styled button /ui. </p>

<p>Having been the architect and interact for scores of large and simple projects, ranging from a few hours to years and millions of dollars long. The code is the embodiment of the &quot;STOP&quot; philosophy along the way to make successful projects. STOP stands for State and Transition Oriented Programming, it orthogonally compliments traditional OOP and MVC/UCM paradigms. It&#39;s sprinkled throughout. </p>

<p>The base is a statemachine library named COGS which supports complex event driven interactivity. It consists of  </p>

<p>hierarchical statemachine flat statemachine composite (aka) pluggable statemachines. </p>

<p>Similar to Design Patterns, there are application behavior design patterns (aka. LifeCycles) a few patterns which I&#39;ve codified, and try to extend, more are discovered everyday.  </p>

<p>Some of these meta patterns: </p>

<p>Chain:  creating chains of tasks to perform in parallel or sequence. A workflow.  e.g. load config.xml-&gt;load all images/sounds in parallel-&gt; present ui 
<br/>Score:  A virtual playhead, across a multitrack sequencer, similar to that of Flash, After Fx etc. used to synchronize and schedule whatever. Network:  a node and link based statemachine, useful for game maps.  </p>

<p>There are other major inspirations </p>

<p>Java&#39;s spring Inversion of Control( IOC), Prevayler for persistence and command,  Graph theory (I used to do work on AI/neural networks), </p>

<p>Tweening/easing equations (not just for tweening!). Dynamic Difficult Adjustment  At the framework level is to be complimentary or competitive to other development, e.g. PureMVC, Cairgnorm.  Though they have different goals.  
<br/>CURRENT STATUSIt&#39;s solid enough to use in production, it&#39;s used in many games, websites, RIA, I and my team use parts of it in about every project, and we hammer on it weekly to make it better and more consistent,  though there are still major architectural changes planned. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still wanting to add a few significant features before I spend time on full documentation, examples and evangelism. Sadly everything is on a backburner relative to my responsibilites at my startup, which eats up most my time.  </p>

<p>I have gotten into presenting on parts (like Cogs and Tweeny), I&#39;m always curious as to what people expect, like and dislike, and I&#39;m using this feedback to improve things, again the goal is to make day to day development as easy as possible.</p>

 title : The trustedresources Open Source Project on Open Hub
 title : The trustedweb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>В общем, идея заключалась в создание глобального репозитория сайтов(для начала зоны СНГ), с целью последующего анализа их содержимого, при чём - совершенно разнопланового: изображения, семантическое значение текста, сайты, на которые данный ресурс ссылается, файлы. которые на нём размещаются. </p>

<p>Основной идей было создание полностью демократизированной системы вычисления индекса &quot;приемлемости&quot;, с минимизацией участия субъективных мнений, при чём если они и входят в параметры вычисления оценки, то должны быть подтверждены фактами, которые предоставляются на публичное обозрение. </p>

<p>Система вычисления индекса приемлемости (ИП) заключалась в 3-х шагах обработки: </p>

<p>Машинная обработка информации сайта Подтверждение результатов администрацией Прибавление отдельного атрибута - мнение общественности. </p>

<p>Первый шаг состоял из следующих подпроцедур: </p>

<p>Лексический анализ содержимого с учётом семантики русского языка. Оценка может иметь значения: &quot;Удовлетворительно&quot;, &quot;Спорно&quot;, &quot;Неудовлетворительно&quot;. Так же подразумевается анализ документов типа &quot;ТХТ&quot;, &quot;DOC&quot;, &quot;PDF&quot; в рамках данного домена. Анализ дерева отношений сайта, по отношению к другим сайтам. То есть, если сайт имеет прямые ссылки на сайты, которые имеют ИП в значении &quot;Неудовлетворительно&quot; либо &quot;Спорно&quot;, то для данного сайта устанавливается соответствующее значение, в зависимости от контекста ссылки (характера ссылки на ресурс с неудовлетворительным либо спорным ИП). Проверка безопасности файлов, которые размещены в рамках данного домена путём возможностей системы вирусной проверки - Др. Веб. Анализ изображений на поиск образов, неудовлетворяющих этическим соображениям, либо содержащие элементы порнографического характера (наиболее утопических пункт). В конце проверки составляется протокол проверки, и описываются все те пункты, которые система сочла как спорные либо неприемлемые, с указанием адреса, по которому они были обнаружены на целевом сайте, и адресом на кешированную версию страницы, созданную в момент анализа. К протоколу добавляются так же результаты проверки файлов антивирусной системой. </p>

<p>Проверка администратором была представлена следующими возможностями: </p>

<p>Проверка протокола, и подтверждение правильности результатов системы, так как возможны ошибки во время определения контекста слов, из-за неоднозначности слов неформального языка, либо ошибок определения характера ссылок на спорные либо неприемлемые ресурсы. Ну, и безусловно, подтверждение результатов системы в плане анализа изображений.   Все расхождения с системным результатом так же должны быть добавлены к протоку вычисления индекса приемлемости, и быть доступны публичному обзору. Администратор обязан подписать результаты проверки и протокол своей цифровой подписью. </p>

<p>Ну и последний пункт заключается в следующем: </p>

<p>Добавление новых фактов, которые возможно смогут повлиять на текущее значение ИП данного сайта. Добавление фактов, на основе которых вычисляется атрибут индекса доверия сайта, который невозможно вычислить путём машинной обработки - индекс доверия к сайту, основанный на фактах мошенничества, обмана пользователей, либо предоставления не соответствующих действительности фактов. </p>

<p>Исходя из вышеописанного, мы получаем два фактора, которые определяют индекс доверия к сайту: Индекс Приемлемости (ИП) и Индекс Доверия (ИД). Это независимые атрибуты, при чём сайт может быть приемлемым, однако с негативным Индексом Доверия, что сообщается в отдельном порядке. </p>

<p>При этом, в данном схеме наиболее полезным и информативным будут является не факторы ИП и ИД, но сам протокол проводки проверки, который так же является публично доступным.  </p>

<p>Зачем это нужно? </p>

<p>Это нужно как обычным людям, которые по тем либо иным причинам хотят получать приемлемые по содержанию информационные материалы среди всего массива данных Интернет. Кроме того, эта информация может быть очень важной корпоративным клиентам, у которых есть необходимость фильтрации информационных материалов, как в плане Приемлемости, так и в плане Достоверности. Ну и, безусловно, в суперсумме двух вышеописанных пользователей мы можем упомянуть ещё одного пользователя - поисковые системы, которые, в каком-то плане, представляют и обычного человека, и корпоративного клиента, так как нуждаются в проверки и ИП и ИД ресурсов. </p>

<p>Вот-с. Думаю, я действительно буду продолжать эту идею, сейчас пока только составил небольшие проекты и UMl-модели базовых операций. Может что-то интересное и получится :) </p>

 title : The tst-gwt Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionThe project is focused on investigation of GWT internal features and its integration possibilities. </p>

<p>Google Code as an open source warehouse is a good and convenient place to share the experience of software development activity. Besides hosting of real big systems Google Code can also give a place for leaving some useful results of software mastering. Such results may have various sources: learning, investigations, by-products of commercial development, etc. </p>

<p>InspirationTest Driven Development (TDD)In many respects the project is inspired by the TDD ideas. TDD has many points and the very interesting one consists in its capability of producing essentials from subsidiary (although unavoidable) things. In TDD a test writing activity (firstly considered as &quot;subsidiary&quot;) becomes very important, bringing a lot of essentials such as: </p>

<p>capability validation system set of requirements (in some sence) implementation design (in some sence) ... </p>

<p>Our caseTBD </p>

<p>OrganizationBasic rules of the project organization are given below. </p>

<p>SubprojectsAs assumed this project is represented by the set of small subprojects. Each of them is created in minimalist style (to be as small as possible) and serves ONLY ONE PURPOSE: to show a some SINGLE feature of the GWT. </p>

<p>FeaturesThe feature may be &#39;plain&#39; or &#39;complex&#39;. Plain feature by definition is not based on the other features, but sometimes it may require other features just for showing itself. For example, whithout the printing feature it is not possible to show most of the other plain features, such as application launching, althouth both of the features are obviously plain. Complex feature (interchangeably named as &#39;integration feature&#39;) when it shows a strictly defined combination of the few plain features. </p>

<p>TODO: Describe example of the integration feature. </p>

<p>Functioning of the feature can be shown either by unit test (if it is possible) or by the mini-tutorial (when some human actions are unavoidable). </p>

<p>Basic conventionsBasic conventions of the project are given below. </p>

<p>Each subproject has its own wiki page Subproject&#39;s wiki-page contains instruction (mini-tutorial) which describes neccessary details for reproducing the test Naming of subprojects and corresponded wiki-pages must clearly reflect the tested feature(s) and meet the following requirements: Names generally are complex, consisting of the few subnames such as EclipseMavenRpc Each subname must start by capital letter Subnames must be sequenced in alphabetical order for better viewing on various lists (on Project Home for example) Dependencies of the subproject TBD...

 title : The tsumufs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is TsumuFS?TsumuFS is a disconnected, offline caching filesystem layer on top of NFS in the spirit of fexd and other caching filesystems (like Coda or Intermezzo). While these other filesystems require specific server-side support, TsumuFS is designed to be simple and elegant by solving only the caching issue, and not the filesystem protocol itself. </p>

<p>GoalsReliability. Allow users to continue working on a locally saved copy of their files if the local nfs server goes away (ie: down) People efficient. Provide a way after the file server comes back up for all changes to be integrated to the filer seamlessly and without user interaction unless a conflict from a concurrent change has occurred. Network/Infrastructure efficiency. Provide for an alternative to moving users&#39; home directories around the various global filers. Consistent user feedback. Provide timely and helpful information to the user of the state of the filesystem in the form of socket or /sys IPC. Direct control over the cached data. It should be possible to exclude files from the cache entirely, and to persistently keep a set of files in the cache. Non goalsTsumuFS should NOT reimplement the network filesystem protocol. NFS is tried and true, and well supported as-is on most architectures -- TsumuFS only augments the NFS layer. It should NOT provide policy or infrastructure for the encryption of the file store. TsumuFS should function at the VFS layer ONLY -- encryption of the underlying file store is up to the administrator. It should NOT implement an entire filesystem to store cached data and the state of TsumuFS&#39;s world. As TsumuFS functions at the VFS level, the underlying filesystems should be used for storage.</p>

 title : The ttblue Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TTBlue is an object-oriented, reflective, application programming interface for C++, with an emphasis on real-time signal processing. It makes use of polymorphic typing, dynamic binding, and introspection to create a cross-platform environment pulling ideas from languages such as Objective-C while remaining within a standard C++ context. </p>

<p>Like Smalltalk and Objective-C, TTBlue typically communicates by sending messages rather than calling functions.  The emphasis on realtime signal processing is manifested in several ways throughout TTBlue, including its very strong support for vector-based audio processing. </p>

Thus, we can create our own object classifiers using the functions. It is interesting. </p>

<p>However, I could not follow how OpenCV developers performed the haartrainig for their face detection system exactly because they did not provide us several information such as what images they used for training.

 title : The tweener Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Tweener (caurina.transitions.Tweener) is a Class used to create tweenings and other transitions via ActionScript code for projects built on the Flash platform. It&#39;s released and maintained for these versions: </p>

<p>ActionScript 2.0, for Flash 7+ and Flash Lite 2.0+ ActionScript 2.0, for Flash 8+ ActionSctipt 3.0, for Flash 9+ Ported/inspired versions for other languages are also available: </p>

<p>haXe version (ported by Baluta Cristian) JavaScript version (ported by Yuichi Tateno) JavaScript version (ported by Michael MacMillan) vvvv version using nodes vvvv version using a native C# dll (faster) (ported by by Rene Westhof) Python version (ported by Benjamin Harling) C++ version (ported by Wesley Marques) In layman&#39;s terms, Tweener helps you move things around on the screen using only code, instead of the timeline. </p>

<p>The general idea of a tweening Class is that dynamic animation and transitions (created by code) are easier to maintain and control, and more stable than animation based on the regular Flash timeline, since you can control it by time rather than by frames. </p>

<p>Aimed both for designers and advanced developers, the Tweener syntax is created with simplicity of use in mind, while still allowing access to more advanced features. Because of this, it follows a &#39;one-line&#39; design mentality when creating new tweenings, with no instancing required (as it&#39;s a static Class) and a set of optional parameters. Also, there are no initialization methods required by Tweener, other than the mandatory &#39;import&#39; command. </p>

<p>Its fluid syntax allows it to be used to tween any numeric property of any object of any class, so it is not tied to specific properties of built-in Classes such as MovieClips or TextFields. This flexibility grants a wider control on how transitions are performed, and makes creating complex sequential transitions on any kind of object easier. </p>

<p>Small file overhead is also one of the main goals of Tweener - once included on SWF movies, Tweener currently takes 8.8kb (AS2 FL2), 9.2kb (AS2) or 10.4kb (AS3) of the total compiled file size. It can be compiled with the Flash IDE, MTASC, or Flex SDK (even with strict rules on), with no errors or warnings thrown during compilation. </p>

<p>Tweener is also the spiritual successor to MC Tween. However, it follows ActionScript&#39;s more strict OOP rules, and gets rid of the fixed parameter order syntax imposed by MC Tween. As a result, code written with Tweener is a lot more readable even for developers not versed on the Class. </p>

<p>Development wise, modularity is one of the main aspects of Tweener. The code is built in a way that new features such as transitions and special tweenings can be added (or removed) easily: for example, properties that are only acessible through methods and functions can be tweened by creating and registering new special properties. Expanding the feature set of the original Class can be done on a per-project basis, with no change to the original files. </p>

<p>From this page, you can download the latest stable (heavily tested) version of Tweener, check out a few examples with source, or read the documentation. There&#39;s also a mailing list for Tweener discussion. </p>

<p>If you prefer, you can also get the very latest versions from Subversion, before they&#39;re considered stable and featured on the download list (the changelog is available here). The repository can also be viewed with a web browser.</p>
 summary : <p>Tweener.Net is a light-weight C# module for easy animation of visible attributes in .Net and Silverlight 2 applications. </p>

<p>At Projectplace we found ourselves in need of a Tweener in a .Net project. Failing to find one we made one. Since the problem solved by a Tweener is so general we&#39;re now publishing it, hoping others will have use for it and also participate in developing it. </p>

<p>This Tweener is heavily inspired by Zeh Fernando&#39;s Flash Tweener. The C# code took of as an improvement on Miguel Moreno&#39;s Tween.cs. </p>

<p>When we say &quot;light weight&quot;, we mean it. Although the tweener will probably fatten some with time, it will try to stay simple, lean and easy to use.</p>

 summary : <p>On Sept 25 2008 I needed a twitter class for a project I was doing. There were several out there - but none of them were complete or even coded properly.  </p>

<p>As an avid OO Designer I built a new class from the ground up to perfectly match the Twitter API using PHP 5. I am a perfectionist so I couldn&#39;t stand excess code, the lack of comments, and missing API functionality. </p>

<p>This class is the best API class out there - it can handle XML and JSON requests/responses from the standard API and the new Trends and Search API&#39;s as well. Calls are made with the powerful cURL library. Results are returned as an easy to use object.</p>

 title : The twitterbots Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SMS is the data protocol that connects most people in our world. Cheaper in many cases than voice, more reliable when there is iffy reception, accessible from the cheapest devices, they have proven to be a reliable resource from in places as disparate as Katrina and Laos. However many obstacles get in the way of using this as a component in technology solutions. One of them is hosting a scalable infrastructure to manage incoming and outgoing messages, typically requiring custom code and dedicated computers.  </p>

<p>This framework evolved from our experiences in the last weeks building the infrastructure for Golden Shadow and surveying requirements for or Mekong Basin program. We are also currently using this as part of our Directory to allow you send position updates via SMS and query nearby friends from your cell phone.  </p>

<p>This framework simplifies writing programs that use Twitter to interact with users. Using Twitter&#39;s services you can effectively create a worldwide SMS gateway with little effort - as long as the interaction with your app falls within the style dictated by Twitter. Using this framework makes writing the code a matter of programming your bot without worrying about plumbing tasks such as user enrollment, and only focusing on themessages you want to exchange with your users. Advanced solutions requiring SMS would probably &#39;graduate&#39; from using Twitter as a core component, but using this bot framework allows for fast prototyping and deployment, initiating the design process (For example we took the first cut of our &#39;Friends nearby&#39; SMS service to Laos and we had tons of feedback after only a day of use - if we had waited to have a full-blown SMS service we wouldn&#39;t have learnt as much, as fast, or as vividly).  </p>

<p>Key requirements:Minimize the code needed to write a ‘bot&#39; that can have conversations with users so that a developer only needs to write the bot logic. Interact with Twitter&#39;s API in a way that conforms to terms of service and minimizes the scalability impact of using the bot on the Twitter infrastructure Manage all the enrollment of ‘followers&#39; needed for an user to have a private conversation with the bot  This project is build on the .NET Framework 2.0 and requires a connection to the internet to interact with Twitter obviously, and a twitter user account to act as the bot itself.  </p>

<p>Note: Twitter has become very popular - and understandably the Twitter team keeps a close eye on the scalability impact of having ‘bots&#39; using their API, as bots touch the system more often than people using interactive applications. Twitter therefore enforces limits on the use of their API and you will need to contact them if you want to build bots that run continuously. You can sidestep this issue if your bots don&#39;t require active conversations with your users by running your bot logic less often.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, Twitter has been very generous and has allowed an exception so a couple of our own proof of concept bots targeting the humanitarian workforce run with less performance throttling. This is something that Twitter manages per bot account and does not come ‘for free&#39; if you use the InSTEDD framework to build your bot.  </p>

 summary : <p>Linux was a kernel in more than one sense of the word.  It was an OS kernel written by a beginner, which became the kernel of a low-tech mass-movement away from high-tech free software possibilities.  I want to replace Linux with something just as useful, but much more maintainable. </p>

<p>I currently have very rough requirements and design based on a &quot;right tool for the right job&quot; approach which should attract multidisciplinary involvement:  Erlang is perhaps the &quot;right tool&quot; for networking, at least.  Perhaps a logic language like Prolog or an object-relational database like Postgres is the best way to manage software version and build dependencies in both a local and a distributed way.  Maybe Ada is the best language for device drivers.  Perhaps one of these message-passing languages (Ada or Erlang) can be a Rosetta Stone for all the others.  Maybe Common Lisp can provide each processor&#39;s main loop.  C++ policy-based design is a powerful static code-generating design-level paradigm, but can D or other metaprogramming-enabled languages do it as well as C++? </p>

<p>OS theorists and hardware designers will be needed to keep the programmers under control.  </p>

<p>I feel this project needs to happen.  I&#39;ve done a lot of research, and every university seems to have their own kernel, and they&#39;re all pretty boring.  The only new and exciting stuff seems to have happened in 1995 or earlier.  Microsoft is coming up with some new ideas, and some of them are very good, but they won&#39;t be free. </p>

<p>Ultsys is just a working title so that it&#39;ll be the same as ultsys.blogspot.com where I&#39;m documenting the background of my thinking.  Blogspot is not a good place for technical discussion so this might be a better forum, or not.</p>

 summary : <p>The Umangite framework simplifies the task of writing web tests with Selenium. It&#39;s built on TestNG, Spring and Cargo. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a simple test: </p>

<p>public class HelloWorldTest extends AbstractSeleniumTest {</p>

<p>  @Override
<br/>  protected String[] getConfigLocations() {
<br/>   return new String[] { ... };
<br/>  }
<br/>	
<br/>  @Test
<br/>  public void test() {
<br/>    open(&#39;/testwebapp/index.html&#39;);
<br/>    assertTextPresent(&#39;Hello There&#39;);
<br/>  }</p>

<p>}AbstractSeleniumTest has an @BeforeClass method that starts the web container and Selenium and @AfterClass method that shuts them down. It also injects itself with Spring beans (from an application context defined by the getConfigLocations()). The Spring beans are responsible for launching Selenium and the web container. There are currently two launchers: one that runs an embedded Jetty and the other uses Cargo to launch Tomcat (To be generalized to support other containers).  </p>

<p>Here are some example bean definitions: </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>  
<br/>   
<br/>   
<br/>  Once of the nice things around this framework is that the same test class can be run with multiple containers - e.g. both Jetty for nimble developer testing and Tomcat for other tests.</p>

 summary : <p>I have seen many frameworks especially in Java. In all of them, most of the time, I find that, you need to learn some amount of theory stuff like, MVC etc., before you start learning how to use them. </p>

<p>One major problem with this is, the terminologies differ in theory and in the framework. Model is turned to &quot;Action&quot; or some other thing, Controller is turned to &quot;...Servlet&quot; or something and View is called &quot;...Renderer&quot; or something. </p>

<p>Its annoying to read theory and then try to figure out what theory term maps to what in the framework. </p>

<p>Another thing is, if you need to switch between programming languages, you need to rewrite the configuration files (ofcourse, code needs to be written anyway... maybe we can have code translation also as a goal??). </p>

<p>The aim of this project is to address these issues and make web applications easy (and fun) to write. It is not required that the resulting work is enterprise-ready, but, its important to have things that are fun to use implemented.</p>

 title : The update-engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Update Engine is a flexible Mac OS X framework that can help developers keep their products up-to-date. It can update nearly any type of software, including Cocoa apps, screen savers, and preference panes. It can even update kernel extensions, regular files, and root-owned applications. Update Engine can even update multiple products just as easily as it can update one. </p>

<p>Google ships many different pieces of Mac software ranging from simple Cocoa applications to complicated software systems. We needed a robust software update solution that would be able to update all of our current and future Mac products. And we designed and built Update Engine to solve this problem.  </p>

<p>The following are some unique features of Update Engine: </p>

<p>Can update virtually any type of product (e.g., Cocoa app, pref pane, kernel extension) Can update non-bundle-based products (e.g., command-line tool, plain file) Can update many products at once Solid framework on which to build We have two movies for you to watch. </p>

<p>The first is by Greg and it gives you and overview of Update Engine, why we built it, and what makes it tick.  In short, HowDoesUpdateEngineWork. IMPORTANT: this demo uses &quot;http:&quot; URLs in the example tickets to save space. To keep things secure in the real world, https: URLs should be preferred when fetching the plist from the server. See UpdateEngineAndSecurity for more details. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The second is by Mark and it walks you through running the HelloEngine sample program. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To browse the Update Engine source code, visit the Source tab.  Changes to Update Engine are documented in the release notes. </p>

<p>If you find a problem/bug or want a new feature to be included in Update Engine, please join the discussion group or submit an issue. </p>

<p>Update Engine follows the Google Objective-C Style Guide. </p>

<p>The Update Engine developers believe in TestingAndCoverage, with a goal to maintain 90% or better code coverage at all times.  Our first release has 97.4% coverage.</p>

 title : The urd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>URD is a program to download binaries from usenet (newsgroups) through a web interface. </p>

<p>While some other programs offer similar services (e.g. Ninan, Sabnzbd), URD doesn&#39;t need external NZB files to function. URD lets you subscribe to newsgroups, and will then automatically analyse those articles to form downloadable &#39;sets&#39;, consisting of all the files belonging to a specific upload. These sets are displayed, and through point and click you can be downloading a binary in no time.  </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t to say that NZB files are unsupported.  URD allows both exporting of NZB files (from a set, for example) and importing. And it can use RSS feeds to download from directly.</p>
 title : The uri-templates Open Source Project on Open Hub

 title : The urlkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>UrlKit Project PageUrlKit supports Adobe Flex applications that need to expose URLs and window titles in the browser to represent their state.  These URLs can be bookmarked, accessed via the Back button, etc.  Such states typically represents some notion of location within the app, but in general can be mapped to any aspect of the application. </p>

<p>Specifically, UrlKit provides: </p>

<p>a Javascript library for deep linking in Flex 2 (in Flex 3, this is provided by the platform) a library of declarative rule objects that describes the lexical elements of the application&#39;s URL and bidirectionally binds them to variables a sample application Joe Berkovitz developed UrlKit in collaboration with Todd Rein of Adobe.  To find out why, read the Rationale. </p>

<p>Latest NewsVersion 0.92 fixes a distribution script error in version 0.91 that failed to copy the JavaScript files for the sample application into the orrect directory. </p>

<p>Version 0.91 now uses back-ported Flex 3 deep linking in its Flex 2 version, providing good cross-browser support for IE7 and Safari.  The new enabled property of FlexBrowserManagerAdapter permits applications to delay the initialization of UrlKit until their application reaches a fully initialized state.  The new navigate() method permits applications to optionally navigate by directly specifying a URL rather than by modifying a navigational model.</p>

 title : The usemon Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Usemon is a monitoring system for usage trends, response time and dependency analysis of plain Java applications or big multi-clustered Java Enterprise applications running in production. The proof of Usemon&#39;s stability and usefulness is confirmed by the fact that one of the worlds largest telecom operators is running Usemon in a clustered WebSphere environment with over 90 enterprise applications. </p>

<p>The Usemon system consists of three separate components: </p>

<p>Usemon AgentThe agent performs byte code manipulation of interesting classes, injecting statistics gathering code in all public methods of classes like EJBs, MDBs, SQL statements, Queue senders or configured POJOs for that matter. </p>

<p>Data is collected in intervals of 60 seconds and transmitted to the collector for storage into a SQL database. </p>

<p>The data is transmitted using UDP multicasts. </p>

<p>Visit the Usemon InstallGuide page for installation instructions. </p>

<p>Usemon CollectorThe Usemon Collector receives the data from the Usemon Agents, transforms the observations and stores them into the SQL database. The data model of the database is based upon a star scheme or a dimensional model if you like and allow very fast slice and dicing of the information. </p>

<p>Dimensional data model suitable for OLAP/BI toolsThe data model has been organized into a star schema, aka. dimensional data model. </p>

<p>Usemon UIsThere are currently two UIs made for Usemon. The first is a GWT based web app and the other one is Usemon Live, a stand alone Java app that is meant for big screens and for monitoring. </p>

<p>Usemon GWT UIOnce I figure out how to organize and upload an image, I will do so. - Steinar </p>

<p>Usemon LiveUsemon Live is a Processing based UI that displays the dependency graph as soon as it arrives from the Collectors and will animate traffic in your system. Usemon Live is designed to be used on a big screen or wall display to show the current affairs. It will let you drill down and look at the performance data directly as well. </p>

 title : The userlogic Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Usually reports are generated with the restrictive assumption that all search conditions must be true. It&#39;s hard to present a user interface that lets real people create complex sentential logic. The interface must be easily visualized and understood, and must import and export well-formed strings. Ethan Pooley and I prototyped this method in 2004, and this plugin is my Ruby on Rails port. </p>

<p>Once the user has created a sentential logic string, you still need to do something with it. The Ruby API lets you easily parse the string into a logical tree, then either evaluate the truth of the tree or convert the tree into SQL. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>phrase = UserLogic::Phrase.new(%(&quot;f&quot; or (&quot;t&quot; and &quot;t&quot;)))
<br/>phrase.true? {|atom| atom == &quot;t&quot;}
<br/>=&gt; true</p>

<p>phrase = UserLogic::Phrase.new(%(&quot;a&quot; or (&quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;)))
<br/>phrase.to_sql do |atom|
<br/>  case atom
<br/>  when &#39;a&#39;: &#39;alpha&#39;
<br/>  when &#39;b&#39;: &#39;beta&#39;
<br/>  when &#39;d&#39;: &#39;delta&#39;
<br/>  end
<br/>end

<br/>    #binrec recurses on the result of split_on_first_element before applying joinparts.
<br/>    [joinparts]
<br/>    binrec].Some explanations. </p>

<p>The first and second lines (terminated by &#39;.&#39;) are internal function definitions
<br/>(Notice how qsort is also terminated by &#39;.&#39;) &#39;.&#39; is the definition syntax in V.</p>

<p>The first function joinparts
<br/>============================
<br/>The function joinpart contains just an application of the operator view.
<br/>&#39;view&#39; is list translator. It takes a list of the form [template : result]
<br/>then it tries to apply the template to the current stack. If it can be applied on the 
<br/>stack, then the arguments named in the template are bound to values in stack. The result
<br/>is then processed, and all the bound elements in result are replaced by their values.</p>

<p>[pivot [*list1] [*list2] : [*list1 pivot *list2]] view expects 3 arguments on the stack,
<br/>  the first a single element pivot, then two lists list1 and list2.
<br/>  It returns a list that is composed of elements of list1 followed by pivot
<br/>  followed by elements of list2 (as defined in result - RHS of &#39;:&#39;).</p>

<p>ie:
<br/>44 [1 2 3] [5 6 7] [pivot [*list1] [*list2] : [*list1 pivot *list2]] view ??
<br/>=&gt; [1 2 3 44 5 6 7]
<br/>(The function ?? is used to print out the elements in the stack now.)</p>

<p>The second function split_on_first_element
<br/>==========================================
<br/>The definition is [uncons [&gt;] split&amp;]
<br/>The uncons splits a list into the first element and the rest of the list.
<br/>ie:
<br/>[1 2 3 4 5] uncons ??
<br/>=1 [2 3 4 5]
<br/>split&amp; takes two arguments, the first is the function F to split a list with,
<br/>and the second the list itself. All elements in the list that passes the function F
<br/>is put into the first list, and all that do not are put into the second list.</p>

<p>ie:
<br/>[1 2 3 4 5 6 7] [4 &gt;] split&amp; ??
<br/>=[5 6 7] [1 2 3 4]</p>

<p>The function F can also take an argument from the stack. so this also works.
<br/>4 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7] [&gt;] split&amp; ??
<br/>=[5 6 7] [1 2 3 4]</p>

<p>Thus the split_on_first_element takes the first element of a list, and split that
<br/>list based on that element as a filter.</p>

<p>binrec
<br/>=======
<br/>binrec expects 4 arguments, </p>

<p>Arg1 is the terminating condition,
<br/>Arg2 is the result if the terminating condition is met.
<br/>Arg3 is an executable statement that returns two entities.
<br/>   The entire binrec statement is performed on each of the
<br/>   two entities until the terminating condition is met.
<br/>Arg4 is what to do with the result of the previous statement.Algorithm. </p>

<p>Here, the small? checks if the list is empty or contains just one element.
<br/>if it is, then the result is arg2 - []
<br/>ie:
<br/>[] small? ??
<br/>=true</p>

<p>[1] small? ??
<br/>=true</p>

<p>[1 2 3 4] small? ??
<br/>=false</p>

<p>split_on_first_element takes is executed on all lists that are larger than size 1
<br/>and as explained above, splits them into two based on the first element.
<br/>on the resultent lists, the entire qsort is performed again due to binrec.
<br/>The last joinparts takes these elements (pivot list1 list2) which are present now
<br/>on the stack, and combines them to produce a single sorted list.A slightly friendlier function (with out the binrec.) </p>

<p>[qsort
<br/>  [joinparts [pivot [*list1] [*list2] : [*list1 pivot *list2]] view].
<br/>  [split_on_first_element uncons [&gt;] split&amp;].
<br/>  [small?]
<br/>    []
<br/>    [split_on_first_element [list1 list2 : [list1 qsort list2 qsort joinparts]] view i]
<br/>  ifte].The binrec and friends are more powerful than the explicit recursion done above, but for people new to concatenative languages, this kind of recursion may look more intuitive. </p>

<p>The green-threads branch contains threads implemented using CPS and trampoline style. The &#39;fork&#39; creates a new thread and pushes its thread id into the stack for the main thread to pickup. &#39;send&#39; takes two words in the stack, the id of the thread to send to and the message. &#39;receive&#39; receives any messages send to this thread. </p>

 summary : <p>IntroductionV4P - Vectors For Pocket - is a minimalistic layered polygons scan-conversion engine. See  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanline_rendering if you don&#39;t understand what it deals with. </p>

<p>V4P consists in a ridiculously short piece of C code. V4P main engine weights ~1000 instructions. </p>

<p>V4P targets very light platforms without advanced graphic processing hardware resources. </p>

<p>V4P may be easily embedded in any GUI or Game development library or application. </p>

<p>V4P has no dependencies with any other library. V4P even brings its own integer only maths routines. </p>

<p>V4P only asks you to provide an horizontal line drawing function (a memset()-like function should work well in most cases). </p>

<p>Beside rendering vectors scene, V4P will help you find collides. </p>

<p>Design IntroductionThe underlying algorithm of V4P can be named: </p>

<p>&quot;Bresenham-like iterative scan-line and active edge cross-over computation based polygon scan conversion algorithm&quot;. </p>

<p>Additionally, most V4P computed lists are smartly quick-sorted, while bit-based computation helps V4P to find collides and pixel highest owner. </p>

<p>V4P design spares memory a lot. It doesn&#39;t deal with Z-buffer, not even &quot;S-buffer&quot; (as depicted here: http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article668.asp). </p>

<p>V4P has been developed and tested on a very old Sony Clie PDA with Palm OS 4 gcc based SDK. V4P should be able to be adapted with few tweakings on any embedded Linux devices and other geeky gadgets. </p>

<p>Further experiments / What to do next?Actually, V4P is not a drawing engine. No span drawing function are provided. Except from the PDA experiment I&#39;ve done. So... </p>

<p>writing more span drawing functions# writing a Linux frame buffer port </p>

<p># write a SDL port </p>

<p># write a DirectFB port </p>

<p># write a DS Linux port </p>

<p>Keep in mind the Color type is a pointer which may actually lead to a structure giving much more information about the way to fill up a polygon, eg. a pixmap. </p>

<p># simple anti-aliasing solution through rescaling trick </p>

<p>writing other libraries on top of V4P# use V4P to design a Flash-like technology </p>

<p># use V4P as a basis for a full animated GUI stack </p>

<p>adding featurestransparent polygonsthis feature needs a change in the pixel parent election code so to call the span drawing routine from the highest opaque polygon to the highest translucent polygon up there. </p>

<p>adding other edge shapesI miss circular curves a lot. But I didn&#39;t find a way to draw them in a single pass algorithm. A simple Bezier discretisation algorithm may help. But has it to be in the core library? </p>

<p>increasing z depth rangeonly 16 layers for now. Using a balanced binary tree of span parents could make z infinitively more precise. </p>

<p>Use more accurate cos/sin/atan/dist routinesavoid refreshing the static parts of the scenean integrated solution need an in-depth rewrite an other solution may be to call the V4P engine repeatedly on &quot;dirty rectangles&quot;. A top library could do that.</p>

 title : The validates-word-count Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SummaryThis plugin adds new simple validation to your rails models. It validates that the value of the specified attribute does not exceed specified word count. </p>

<p>SVN Repositoryhttp://validates-word-count.googlecode.com/svn/ </p>

<p>Installation&gt; ruby ./script/plugin install http://validates-word-count.googlecode.com/svn/tags/validates-word-count </p>

<p>UsageJust drop the following lines to a model you want to add this validation to: </p>

<p>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  validates_word_count :summary, :maximum =&gt; 30
<br/>  validates_word_count :about_author, :minimum =&gt; 25
<br/>  validates_word_count :annotation, :in =&gt; 100..150
<br/>endThat&#39;s it. It will make sure that the :summary value does not exceed 30 words, :annotation value word count is in 100..150 words range, and about_autor has at least 25 words. </p>

<p>It  supports regular validation options such as :if, :unless, :allow_nil etc., and works fine in conjunction with &#39;Validation Scenariios&#39; plugin (http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/validation_scenarios) </p>

<p>It also extends ruby core String class and adds &#39;words&#39; method to it, so all the following assertions pass: </p>

<p>assert_equal 0, &#39;&#39;.words
<br/>assert_equal 1, &#39;Hello&#39;.words
<br/>assert_equal 2, &#39;Hello All!&#39;.words</p>
 summary : <p>Works just like other validations: validates_xml :field.</p>

 summary : <p>SummaryAdds validation scenarios support to Active Record models </p>

<p>SVN Repositoryhttp://validation-scenarios.googlecode.com/svn/ </p>

<p>Installation&gt; ruby ./script/plugin install http://validation-scenarios.googlecode.com/svn/tags/validation-scenarios </p>

<p>UsageFirst, in your models, you declare validation scenarios details using when_scenario_is method. In the following example, both User and Address models have user_registration and profile_update scenarios declared: </p>

<p>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
<br/>  has_one :address
<br/>  
<br/>  when_scenario_is :user_registration do |this|
<br/>    this.validates_presence_of :email
<br/>    this.validates_associated :address
<br/>  end
<br/>  
<br/>  when_scenario_is :profile_update do |this|
<br/>    this.validates_presence_of :first_name :unless =&gt; :something_here
<br/>  end 
<br/>endclass Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base 
<br/>  belongs_to :user
<br/>  
<br/>  when_scenario_is :user_registration do |this|
<br/>    this.validates_numericality_of :postcode
<br/>  end
<br/> 
<br/>  when_scenario_is :profile_update do |this|
<br/>    this.validates_presence_of :street_address_1
<br/>    this.validates_presence_of :city
<br/>  end
<br/>endThen, when you want to process, for example, the user_registration scenario - you just start it using: ActiveRecord::Base.with_validation_scenario method. In the following example it validates User object per rules declared for user_registration scenario. </p>

<p>Please also note that associated Address instance is also aware that the current validation scenario is user_registration. That&#39;s why the following test passes: </p>

<p>ActiveRecord::Base.with_validation_scenario(:user_registration) do
<br/>  user = User.new(:email =&gt; &quot;foo@bar.baz&quot;)
<br/>  user.build_address(:postcode =&gt; &#39;intentionally_not_numerical&#39;)
<br/>  assert !user.save
<br/>  assert user.errors.invalid?(:address)
<br/>  assert_match(/is not a number/i, user.address.errors.on(:postcode))
<br/>end</p>

<p>「香草期刊系統」的目標是建構一套簡單易用的中文學術期刊網站系統，主要提供給台灣的學術期刊使用。雖然近年來各種網頁出版系統在台灣可說相當普及，Blog 在台灣也如雨後春筍一般蓬勃成長，然而，台灣的學院中所製作的各項學術期刊網站，往往仍然採用手工製作網頁的方式建構，而沒有一套適合的、方便的系統可供使用，而許多國外的系統，往往也因為編輯傳統與習慣的不同，而不見得能夠妥善應用在台灣的環境中。</p>

<p>因此，我們使用 PHP 與 MySQL 開發「香草期刊系統」，透過許多 PHP 模組如 EzSQL、phpmailer等，目前完成了一套堪用的系統，期許日後能夠日漸完善。這套系統除了可以讓您上傳文章之外，也可以讓您上傳照片、附件檔案，同時您也可以將最新期期刊的目錄，以電子郵件方式寄送給訂戶閱讀。</p>

<p>English:</p>

<p>&#39;Vanilla Journal&#39; aims to create an easy-to-use publishing system for Chinese journals, especially for traditional Chinese users in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Yes, yet another CMS.</p>

<p>Since online publishing systems such as blogging systems are now popular in taiwan, however, there is still not a CMS for online academic journals or websites of the academic journals, colleges still use html editors such as Dream Weaver or Front Page to create an online journal and do not support database searching and advanced functions. In the other hand, most western systems cat not satisfy the needs of a Chinese journal since they are in different tradition.</p>

<p>&#39;Vanilla Journal&#39; is a PHP and Mysql based system and it&#39;s powered by EzSQL, phpmailer and so on. You can not only publish your article on web but also uploading images and attachments of other file types, you can mail the table of content of your most new published journal to the subscribers, too.</p>

 summary : <p>FAR (FlashArchive)A command line tool for creating ZLIB compressed archives that can be streamed in progressively from the Flash player at run-time, using the provided ActionScript 3 API. </p>

<p>FAR is useful when doing Flash projects that involve numerous volatile sources, like for example XML or text files. For example, Papervision3D projects tend contain multiple ASE or Collada mesh models that require a) a lot of loading management code and b) waste quite a bit of bandwith when being send to the client uncompressed.  </p>

<p>FAR brings some relieve here by bringing back file sizes with ZLIB compression and taking care of loading resources from the archive in the correct order, notifying the application of its progress. </p>

 title : The variability-management-research Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Variability management allows product customization by specifying variation points and composition rules related to feature models and product configurations. This is an interesting kind of crosscutting concern, since a feature might require variation points to be spread into different artifacts of each Software Product Line model (requirements, design, source code, and tests). In order to modularize use case scenario variability management, we proposed a crosscutting approach that weaves scenarios, feature models, product configurations, and configuration knowledge. The result leads to independent specification of behavior and variability concerns. The weave process was modeled using a Haskell library. In the next steps of this research we will extend our models to represent variability managemen in design and test artifacts.</p>

 title : The velocityme Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Velocityme is a project management tool which also incorporates issue tracking and time sheet management. Normally these systems are separate, usually resulting in duplication of effort required to keep each system up to date. The reduction in effort and improvement in data quality is best assured when the systems are combined in one suite. By combining project management with issue tracking one is able to keep the project plan live. Velocityme automatically updates timescales and responsibilities when project changes are made. The issues which are raised during the running of the project automatically update the project plan to reflect the real situation. The result is that the project status and all control activity can be assessed more efficiently because the plan is constantly updated as issues are addressed. </p>

<p>Innovative FeaturesHierarchical storage of information - all the data is stored in a tree (much like a file-system) which gives the users a high degree of flexibility with regard to partitioning their tasks into sensible groupings. Flexible permission assignment - all tasks that can be performed within Velocityme are controlled by permissions. Users can be assigned different combinations of permissions in different parts of the tree by using a mechanism of roles. Roles are associated with different functions that users play within the system (eg CEO, Project Manager, Administrator, Engineer, Foreman, Tester etc) and can be configured to have a suitable combination of permissions. Accountability - an audit trail is automatically maintained whenever actions, which affect the data, are taken. The type and details of the changes are recorded along with the date and person who made the change. Configurable work flow - where required, it is possible to configure Velocityme with the processes defined within a company for workflow. If you have well defined procedures for any task then they can be set up, i.e. ISO. Additional FeaturesAccess to status reports through Velocityme can decrease the need for meetings and phone calls. Email notifications of changes and responsibility assignment are automatically sent. Project progress with respect to milestones can be assessed. A web based user interface is used for accessibility worldwide. All that is required to control your projects with Velocityme is some form of Internet connection and a web browser running on a desktop, laptop or cell phone. The scope of visible information is determined by a user&#39;s profile and is based on role assignments and levels of authority. This can be extended all the way to customers, i.e. transparency. Current StatusVelocityme uses EJB2.1. It has currently only been tested on JBoss and works up to version 3.2.8.SP1. You will also need to download xdoclet- </p>

<p>Build InstructionsDownload and install JBoss-3.2.8.SP1 Download and install xdoclet-bin-1.2b2 Download and install a suitable database connector and put it in jboss/server/default/deploy The ant.properties file needs to be configured with your settings Edit velocityme/src/etc/velocityme-db.xml to configure the data source - defaults to mysql. Run ant - this builds the code and deploys the ear file and DS file to the jboss directory specified in ant.properties. The first time you visit the web page which is at /velocityme you will be presented with a guid and asked for a license key. You can create this by running velocityme/build/client/licenseGenerator.jar.</p>

 title : The visualswing4eclipse Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>What is it?Visual Swing for Eclipse is a GUI designer tool, which consists of a set of Eclipse Plug-ins. It aims to provide a Swing designer for Eclipse for Java desktop developers. </p>

<p>Update sitehttp://visualswing4eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.dyno.visual.swing.site/ </p>

<p>RequirementEclipse 3.3 or higher Java 5 or higher IntroductionIt is well known that Swing is gaining more and more momentum in recent years. Before Java 1.5, Swing was ugly, slow and full of bugs. In fact, it used to be so bad, that IBM created another GUI toolkit named SWT, on which Eclipse was built. SWT was a great success. Sun felt the pressure from Eclipse. Since Java 1.5, Sun has been improving Swing. The Swing team made a lot of progress and Swing is winning back its lost ground. Actually, it won the No. 1 in GUI toolkit market three years ago. At that time, there was a market research report given by Evans Data Corporation that Swing is the dominant GUI Toolkit for Northern American developers. The following statement is quoted from one of Hans Muller&#39;s blog. It was excerpted from the report: </p>

<p>&quot;Java Swing with 47% use, has surpassed WinForms? as the dominant GUI development                                          toolkit, an increase of 27% since fall 2004.&quot; 
<br/>(http://weblogs.java.net/blog/hansmuller/archive/2005/10/official_swing.html) </p>

<p>As a Swing lover, I am very happy to witness the progress on Swing in recent years. The latest good news about Swing is the newly released Java 6 update 10, namely the consumer JRE. If you don&#39;t know what Java 6 update 10 is and what it has do with Swing, please take a look at the following page: </p>

<p>http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/java6u10 </p>

<p>For a long time, GUI development in Java is very weak. One of the reasons is that Swing lacks good GUI designers. The Matisse Project in NetBeans brought hopes to swing developers. But we are very sad to notice that although Eclipse dominates the Java IDE market, but it lacks a good open source designer. Although it used to have one, ie. VE, it was painful to use. Now this project seems to be abandoned by eclipse. Of course there are some commercial tools in the market. But they are either not free or not open sourced. Developers using Eclipse for free have to manually code swing applications. </p>

<p>This project is determined to produce a free, open-sourced and Netbeans-like GUI designer for the Eclipse IDE. It now has the following features: </p>

<p>Designing Swing component like NetBeans visual designer, especially the component layout, providing similar anchors, baselines and layout hints etc. Generating and parsing java code without the help of .form file. The code generated is readable, like those of VE(visual editor of eclipse). Look and feel support during design, preview and the generated code. Visual tree and table designing. It is very intuitive to design tree and table in this tool. What you need is only drag and drop a table/tree, and invoke the in-place editor to add or delete rows or columns or editing data in the table, etc. Provide visual menu designer. This is not a structural designing like those of other designers. You can drag and drop menu items directly on to the form. The look and feel is exactly what you get. Responsive and fast. This toolkit uses the same JVM with eclipse. And code generation follows editing-save-editing cycle. Therefore it is very responsive and fast. NOTE that the latest version requires Eclipse 3.4 or Eclipse 3.4.1. The java runtime environment requires to be Java 6. If you want to test Nimbus look and feel, you should install java 6 update 10. </p>

<p>This project is released under EPL(Eclipse Public License 1.0) so that everyone can freely get the source code and make contributions back. </p>

<p>Company: QUT, School of Data communication </p>

<p>Abstract: </p>

<p>Electronic auctions have become very popular in the last few years. They are a convenient way to buy and sell goods. Secure e-auction provides confidentiality to he bid such that only the bidder knows its value and at the same time it provides integrity service to the bid so the bidder cannot alter the value of the bid after its submission. E-cash is an anonymous public key certification system which allows an user to obtain a certificate on its public key from a certificate authority without revealing the value of the public key. Such technology is useful to simulate the properties of the physical cash system </p>

<p>The aim of this project was to implement an anonymous auction system along with an e-cash system. An anonymous auction system enables participants to conduct electronic auctions without their identity being made public and also provides confidentiality of the bid, anonymity of the bidder, and publicly verifiable transcripts of all the bids. </p>

<p>From an existing system design the software architecture of the auction system was developed and implemented. We also describe the framework of an anonymous auction system and the softwares that was used to implement such a system.</p>

You want to create another tree under /projects?  There shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but best contact one of the &#39;project owners&#39; first, and have a chat about it. </p>

 summary : <p>Vusion is basically a video mixer that supports input from either an image, MPEG-1 encoded video or from a Video4Linux device. Vusion was written in python and uses the pygame library for mixing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s designed to be controlled via a MIDI controller rather than a standard mouse or keyboard. I chose to design it this way because MIDI is an invaluable system for theatrical productions and the specific timing of effects is vital. Using MIDI allows Vusion to be easily controlled via a MIDI Show Control application. </p>

<p>Additionally Vusion will eventually support the rm-rf SIPC (Show Inter-Process Communication) Standard which uses dbus to control applications similarly to a MIDI Show Control program. </p>

<p>Project StatusAs of November 2007, Vusion is being rewritten to have a better modular and more defined code-structure. The next release of Vusion will probably be 2.0 which will have many new features: </p>

<p>Pluggable 2D Effects Pluggable 3D Effects (With OpenGL) Setting transparency for individual surfaces Transitioning between a pre-defined combination of surfaces Improved and powerful XML configuration allowing robust and extensive MIDI control Support for more than 2 surfaces Configuration now in one file that conforms to the rm-rf XML Configuration Document standard Some simple built-in 2D effects: Translate, Rotate, Zoom, Per channel gamma changing Some simple built-in 3D effects: Surface &#39;flip&#39;, Box transition</p>

 summary : <p>A compact implementation of an R4RS Scheme interpreter in C++, together with a bytecode compiler (written in Scheme itself).  The interpreter can bootstrap the compiler into a standalone compiler, which can then produce standalone executables of other Scheme source files.  Good test suite and easy to extend.  Earlier versions are known to run on VxWorks (and the current one may too).</p>

 summary : <p>The WADO standard specifies a Web-based service for serving up DICOM objects, such as images and or reports. WADO is intended for distribution of results and images to healthcare professionals.  </p>

<p>DCM4CHE, a self titled Open Source Clinical Image and Object Management System, serves up images via WADO that exist in the DICOM archive. </p>

<p>RAILS, is an extensible web framework built on the Ruby Programming Language. </p>

<p>Bring these three together to create &quot;wado-on-rails&quot;  and you have a simple search mechanism powered by Ferret, that accesses the dcm4che database, then lights up the related images for the patient with the ever popular lightbox2. </p>

<p>wado-on-rails is an academic work that was originally intended to compete with XERO, but now has seen some time and experimentation for image review on silly gadgets like Apple&#39;s iPhone.</p>

 title : The wanbooks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Our goal is to create a web application to allow anyone to turn their personal book collection into a lending library. There are other implementations of the basic idea, but WANDERING BOOKS takes the concept further: it will not be just a personal library manager, but rather a collective library manager and it will bring forth a &#39;Book Commons&#39;. </p>

<p>WHAT IS A COLLECTIVE LIBRARY?It&#39;s the collection of all books belonging to you and to your friends which are available for lending. The catalog of such a library is the union of the catalog of each user&#39;s personal collection plus her/his friends personal collections. Therefore, this catalog is different for each user who has a different set of friends. </p>

<p>THE BOOK COMMONSUsers will be able to &#39;liberate&#39; some their books, which then become part of a &#39;Book Commons&#39;, and available to all users. A liberated book can be held by anyone as long as no one else wants to borrow it. If you are holding a liberated book and another person asks for it, you are required to pass it on within a certain period. </p>

<p>CURRENT STATUSA Django-based version of Wandering Books is under development. A test site has been chosen: the Reserva Cultural project at USP Leste. We are using the QuestionPro system to perform user studies among current and potential users of the Reserva Cultural.</p>

 title : The wansim Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>IntroductionWANsim allows you to simulate (more accurately, emulate) a WAN connection. In particular, it allows a user to change the emulated WAN speed, latency, variation, packet loss, packet duplication and packet corruption aspects. WANsim is configured as a network bridge that is established at boot time.  </p>

<p>WANsim utilises the Linux Kernel NETEM functionality to accomplish its goals. Although relatively well documented, this functionality is not the easiest to use. WANsim wraps this into a simple to use script that can be accessed by simply logging into the Linux host using the wansim user account (see ScreenShot). </p>

<p>WANsim was originally written for my own needs. It is provided to you in the hope that it might be useful. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any suggestions, problems or patches. </p>

 title : The warc-tools Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The main goal of WARC Tools is to facilitate and promote the adoption of the WARC file format for storing web archives by the mainstream web development community by providing an open source software library, a set of command line tools, web server plug-ins and technical documentation for manipulation and management of web archive files, or WARC files. </p>

<p>WARC files are produced by web archiving crawlers, such as Heritrix, the open-source, extensible, Web-scale, archiving quality Web crawler developed by the Internet Archive with the Nordic National Libraries, and Hanzo&#39;s own commercial crawlers. </p>

<p>The project is lead by Hanzo Archives, in collaboration with Internet Archive Web team, and supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC). </p>

<p>WARC Tools are to be implemented in a set of core libraries, and the functionality to be made available to end users as command line tools, extensions to existing tools, and simple web applications for accessing WARC content. In addition all the libraries will have APIs and dynamic language bindings and will be made available as software libraries for developers.  </p>

<p>The library and tools will be scriptable (command lines in shell scripts, dynamic language bindings to the library), and programmable (dynamic language bindings, Java packages, and the C library itself). </p>

<p>Migration and interoperability with legacy tools is important and this project will implement functionality for these tools and the artefacts they create, in order to enable rapid progression and adoption of WARC by the mainstream. To this end, integrating or linking to HTTrack, curl and wget for example are all going to be part of the Hanzo WARC Tools. These will be released as open source code, together with installers, documentation and man pages. </p>

<p>The library and tools will be implemented in ANSI C and will be highly portable, with build/installation on various Linux and Unix distributions, as well as Windows, together with unix man pages, build and installation guides, developer guides, etc. </p>

<p>The project mailing list is here: http://groups.google.com/group/warc-tools </p>

<p>Project Proposal is here: http://netpreserve.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=171&amp;sid=73a8903e04ea2e8fb091e8c7e9e618b1 (IIPC members only) </p>

 title : The warmelonsrts Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=584507 </p>

<p>WarMelons:RTS is a revamp of MegaJohnny&#39;s original WarMelons. In short, WarMelons one and two involve the spawning of different classes of &quot;melons&quot; that can attack and be destroyed by melons of different teams. These melons can be commanded, as well as attached to contraptions, vehicles, and fortifications to create a war based strategy game. WarMelons can be as simple as having two people make battleships and sending them at each other, or as epic as a six-sided war for resources and terrain. </p>

<p>Structures, costs, and build time are now a huge factor (though these can all be turned off should you just desire the new features). Bases most be built and resource nodes controlled. Supply lines need to be guarded and attacked. WarMelons:RTS is compatible with Lynix and ParaDukes&#39;s Tiberium, adding harvesting and refining to the game. Capture points are also another option for gaining resources. </p>

<p>WarMelons:RTS is compatible with essentially any map and compatible with almost all addons. Should you want a small and brutal match gm_construct would be fine. Care for an epic war? Try playing on gm_superstruct? Fancy an intergalactic war? Play on sb_gooniverse with spacebuild or spacebox enabled. </p>

<p>Everything about WM:RTS is made to be as customizable as possible. From resource rates, to melon costs, to movement speeds I tried to make an ample amount of server variables to tweak. Most other changes can be made by simple changing a value or two in the lua files.</p>

 title : The warp-persist Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Warp-persist is a lightweight library that provides persistence and transactions for applications using Google Guice. </p>

<p>You can use warp-persist inside web and servlet applications as well as EJB and simple desktop applications. All with a few simple configuration steps. </p>

<p>Quick HitsInject DAOs &amp; Repositories Flexible units-of-work Declarative transaction management Using @Transactional Or your own custom AOP Dynamic Finders (reduce boilerplate query code) Warp-persist fully supports: </p>

<p>Hibernate Java Persistence API (JPA) db4objects </p>

<p>...and is easily extensible to any persistence system of your choice!</p>
 summary : <p>This is an example project that uses Warp Persist and JPA to save application data. There is NO webapp integration, this is a simple console example and should serve as a decent starting point for back-end Guice applications that need to persist data. </p>

<p>There are 3 examples: </p>

<p>1) Dynamic Finders: This abstracts the finders to a DAO layer and uses warp&#39;s dynamic queries. http://warp-persist-sample.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dynf/ </p>

<p>2) Named Queries: This uses the injected entity manager directly within the managers to retrieve and persist data. http://warp-persist-sample.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/named/ </p>

<p>3) Domain Driven Design: This uses domain driven design and places the database access methods right into the model (domain) classes themselves. This still needs some work. http://warp-persist-sample.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ddd/ </p>

<p>Eclipse was used as the IDE to develop these and the .project and .classpath files are included. The easiest way to view the samples is to checkout the root and import the project into eclipse. You will need to set a classpath variable for the root lib directory though: WARP_SAMPLES_LIB=../lib </p>

<p>All 3 applications are identical in functionality. </p>

<p>Let me know if there are any other Guice + warp-persist examples you would like to see. </p>

 summary : <p>What is web.php?web.php project started as an experiment to build a simple and minimalistic front controller based model-view-controller implementation for PHP. web.php&#39;s main function is to handle the flow control between HTTP request and HTTP response. web.php doesn&#39;t define how to implement models (the choice is yours). It has only a few simple rules on how to implement controllers and views.  </p>

<p>While you concentrate on m, v and c, the web.php tries to stay out of your way. It helps developers by doing the dirty work between the layers. It glues the layers together in a neat and efficient way. </p>

<p>web.php&#39;s codebase is very small, and it&#39;s not very correct to call it a framework. It&#39;s more like a building block for your own framework. web.php tries not to restrict your choices of the other parts of a mvc framework. </p>

 title : The webforms2 Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Update, 3 June 2009: Now that the Web Forms 2.0 has been edited into HTML5, this project will seek to implement as much of the HTML5 Forms section as possible. This will be a complete rewrite of the codebase. Restarting this project will commence as time permits. </p>

<p>A cross-browser implementation of the WHATWG Web Forms 2.0 specification. This specification is currently a mature working draft and has been adopted by the W3C HTML Working Group to serve as a starting point for the next version of HTML. This implementation will follow the HTML 5 specification that evolves from the W3C process. </p>

<p>The implementation has been tested and should function in: </p>

<p>Mozilla Firefox 1.0.8 Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.9 Mozilla Firefox 2 Internet Explorer 6 Internet Explorer 7 Safari 2.0.4 Safari 3 (Windows) Opera 9 (native experimental implementation) </p>

<p>Implemented FeaturesExtensions to form control elements The form and select elements are extended with data attributes for fetching values and options from external resources.

<p>Or you may include the compressed version of this file (via Dean Edwards&#39; packer along with other optimizations): </p>

<p>It is important that the file webforms2.css and webforms2-msie.js both be located in the same directory as webforms2.js or webforms2-p.js (whichever you decide to use). For users of Internet Explorer, the file webforms2-msie.js is part of a hack that ensures that the Web Forms 2.0 functionality is initialized before the load event. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you may install a user script that enables testing (and usage) on any site. </p>

<p>Once the library has been included, then write HTML and JavaScript that take advantage of the features that Web Forms 2.0 specifies. In authoring XHTML pages using Web Forms 2.0, you may include the following DTDs to validate your code (these DTDs have passed validation but they have not been verified to correctly validate a WF2 document; please attempt to do so and write in with the results): </p>

<p>XHTML 1.0 Strict + Web Forms 2.0 DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional + Web Forms 2.0 DTD </p>

<p>Demo Sites: </p>

<p>http://mangos.cjb.net/webow/demo/ (Demo Server - Old Core (for Mangos)) https://xtr33m3.cjb.net/ (Live Server) Download Versions: Last Full Release: 1.0.2.7 Rev 1 SVN: svn://illidan.servegame.com/webow_old </p>

<p>How to Install: </p>

<p> Open the website on your browser, fill all the settings and press continue (yes, easy as that). If incorrect, an error will appear explaning the situation.  Setting correctly the server owner is very important, he&#39;ll be the one with full priviledges to the whole website.  If you wish to install it outside your Local Network, just open the file inc/install/pageinstall.php and change the line 3 from $ANY = false; to $ANY = true;. Since after that everyone is allowed to access that file, do it at your own risk. </p>

<p>How to Use: </p>

<p> After installation, make sure all existing players change their profile in Account Management. By default their Display Name will be their Account Name.  Administrators will have a link where they can set up the whole website. It&#39;s realy easy to manage it, so feel free to explore it.  Many things will be installed by default. So you can either change them, remove or even keep them like they are.  About mailing, if you have it enabled but it wont reach the mail server, it will be defined as if you don&#39;t have a mail server, and other functions will be used. </p>

<p>About Modifying: </p>

<p> Since this is an Open Source and a Freeware Project, I allow anyone to modify WeboW as long as they keep the original credits to me (ex.: Developed by Zynaga, Modified by Someone). </p>

<p>Please post all your Suggestions, Critics, Rates and Bug Reports about WeboW. Thank you, and remember this is only an educational project. Enjoy it.</p>

 title : The webpymail Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is another attempt to make a webmail app in python. I aim on a first stage to build a standards compliant imap webmail client with the basic functionality we can find in squirrelmail without plugins. I&#39;m not too worried about the user interface since it will be extremely easy to use the Django project templates to customize it. </p>

<p>ContactI didn&#39;t bother to setup a mailing list for this project since it is on its early stages. Please write to &quot;helder at paxjulia dot com&quot; if you have any comments about this project.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s done?IMAP library - imaplib2The IMAP proto is a bit complex, for me, the most difficult part in dealing with IMAP is to efficiently parse the server responses and within the IMAP responses the FETCH command ones are really complicated. Right now we parse to a useful format almost all the responses sent by the server. </p>

<p>For instance: </p>

<p>BODYSTRUCTURE FETCH responses are transformed in a class hierarchy, it&#39;s easy to get the part numbers for each part and then get only those message parts in which we&#39;re interested; ENVEVELOPE FETCH responses are transformed in a dict; Besides this, we can also get unasked for responses from the server, these are parsed correctly and stored on a response structure from where they can be read.  </p>

<p>Finally, the optional codes and tagged responses are also stored in a log, and callback functions can be defined to react to these responses. </p>

<p>Higher Level IMAP library - hlimapIn order to have a more intuitive and simpler way to deal with the IMAP complexity, I&#39;ve added an extra layer on top of imaplib2. Since this is being developed parallel to the Django webmail client, the result is that it&#39;s very easy to use from a Django template. For example to make a message list view, the Django view code to get the necessary information is: </p>

<p>M = ImapServer(&#39;example.com&#39;)           # Connect to the server
<br/>M.login(&#39;example user&#39;,&#39;example pass&#39;)  # Login
<br/>folder = M.folders[folder].select()     # Get the folder and select it
<br/>folder.messages.change_search(criteria) # Change the search criteria
<br/>msg_len = folder.messages.len()         # To do the pagination
<br/>[...]
<br/>message_list = folder.messages[i:j]     # Get the message list On the django template we do something like: </p>

<p>{% for msg in message_list %}
<br/>    {{ msg.envelope.env_date }}
<br/>    {{ msg.envelope.env_subject }}
<br/>{% endfor %}Django based webmail clientThe implemented features are: </p>

<p>Multiple server support, configured through the admin interface; IMAP authentication, the Django built-in auth is only used for the superuser; Auto creation of users - if the user successfully authenticates against the IMAP server then a new django user is created &#39;@&#39;; Mailbox List (subscribed mailboxes); Folder List; Message List (paginated); Message view, only the TEXT/PLAIN parts, the others, including the html parts, may be viewed/downloaded from the message view; Reply, Reply to All, Forward, Inline Forward. Please note that I&#39;m using Cyrus and Gmail to test, so if you try to use this on another kind of server the results may not be the same.</p>

<p>CARTELLS: Si un cartell esta buit posar un anunci del propi cartell (quan es subasta, com es subasta, si ja hi ha pujes...)(Subastes del 10 al 20 de cada mes)(entra en vigor el dia 1 de cada mes a les 00h)(Per a comoditat de clients forts... q no vullguen estar cada mes pujant es deu fer una opció de forma q es mantinga la puja) Es a dir, si jo pague 20e al mes per tindre el cartell, aquest ix a subasta cada mes, i jo tinc activada l&#39;opció de que automáticament puje 20e. Si em sobrepujen l&#39;aplicació deu avisarme. Per a fer el pagament quan es fa una puja automática es deu preingressar l&#39;import en forma de euros-wij). Si no està pre-ingressat no s&#39;activará l&#39;opció automàtica (l&#39;aplicació tb deu avisar). </p>

<p>Per als usuaris q mai hagen comprat un cartell els ixira de tan en tan en els cartells buits l&#39;oferta de et regalem 100e-wij per a q compres un cartell. </p>

<p>Estadístiques cartells/entitats. </p>

<p>TO DO next WIJWIJ day: </p>

<p>TODO keep track in db for statistics (premiar als usuaris q van introduir noves entitats + q als q han modificat entitats) enviar emails des del servidor a les entitats (/wijwij/email/xxxx/) rollo comercial (si la entitat te owner deu indicar el temps máxim que tardarà en contestar els emails) </p>

<p>Xavi: </p>

<p> cartells (subastes...)(de moment podem posar q els interessats envien un email, per als primers 1 mes gratis) </p>

<p>IDEA NOVEDOSA: A més de puntuar i comentar els llocs es podrá posar queixes. Les queixes deuran ser justificades amb la corresponent fulla de reclamació i factura (parlar amb algú relacionat amb la legalitat per veure si es pot fer). Posar reclamacions q hagen sigut positives i tb rebutjades obviament amb diferents valors. Obviament si el client decideix retirar les queixes per alguna raó (q el restaurat/hotel li demana disculpes o li torna els diners o el compensa o pq vol) podrà fer-ho. Estaria molt bé pq els clients podrien fer pública la seva denuncia. </p>

<p>Tb poden haver stels wij q els otorguen els N clients més actius de l&#39;any. Els restaurants podrán saber qui son i oferir degustacions en el periode d&#39;asignació d&#39;estels. Els admins sempre figurarán entre la llista :) </p>

 title : The wicketinaction Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Wicket in ActionThis project hosts the source code for the examples of the Wicket in Action book written by Martijn Dashorst and Eelco Hillenius. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>About the bookThere are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of them require you to learn special coding techniques and new, often rigid, patterns of development. Wicket is different. As a component-based web application framework, Wicket lets you build maintainable enterprise-grade web applications using the power of plain old Java objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate, and Maven. Wicket automatically manages state at the component level, which means no more awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant programming model enables you to write rich web applications quickly. </p>

<p>Wicket in Action is an authoritative, comprehensive guide for Java developers building Wicket-based web applications. This book starts with an introduction to Wicket&#39;s structure and components, and moves quickly into examples of Wicket at work. Written by two of the project&#39;s earliest and most authoritative experts, this book shows you both the “how-to” and the “why” of Wicket. As you move through the book, you&#39;ll learn to use and customize Wicket components, how to interact with other technologies like Spring and Hibernate, and how to build rich, Ajax-driven features into your applications.</p>

<p>Why Develop Widgets for WidgetFX?The biggest setback for user interface design in the history of modern computing was the marketing push for thin-client, web-based UIs.  The whole software industry has been shackled by browser incompatibilities, Javascript limitations, and a document-centric model for web applications.  It has taken a decade of engineering and framework design in HTML and Javascript to match what desktop client technology could easily do in the 80s. </p>

<p>WidgetFX takes advantage of Sun&#39;s JavaFX client technology to create stunning user interfaces in a fraction of the time you would spend with traditional web technologies, while providing simple one-click deployment and powerful desktop integration.  If you can dream of an application or design, WidgetFX makes it easy and enjoyable to develop. </p>

<p>How WidgetFX compares to other widget containers: </p>

<p>Open-Source - WidgetFX is a 100% open-source widget container (widgets themselves can be licensed commercially) Cross-platform Support - There are a plethora of widget frameworks, but they are all incompatible, and none of them are truly cross-platform.  WidgetFX runs on all major platforms including Windows XP/Vista, Linux, and Mac OS X. Robust Security Model - The migration of web technologies to widgets has left gaping security holes, which is a problem all Javascript based widget frameworks share.  In contrast, WidgetFX has a robust security model that leverages the secure sandbox of the Java platform. (planned for 0.2 release) Rich Desktop Applications - Most widget containers are porting legacy web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript back to the desktop, which doesn&#39;t allow them to take advantage of Rich Internet Application (RIA) functionality.  In contrast, WidgetFX is designed to be on the front-end of a Rich Desktop Application (RDA) movement by providing a very rich library of visual, animation, and media capabilities. </p>

<p>How WidgetFX differs from existing Java deployment options (Applets/Web Start): </p>

<p>Low-memory Footprint - Within a browser applets can share a single VM, but once they are dragged to the desktop to be &quot;web-startified&quot; they lose this capability.  For a large number of widgets, this will quickly add up to a large footprint both in memory and JVM startup time. Open on Startup - Widget containers both startup automatically on boot and also start any widgets that were open on close.  While you could add hooks to a web-start application to do this for a single application, it is not as seamless as having the user &quot;expect&quot; your widget to be there on start-up. Widget Mindshare - Widgets are becoming mainstream, and while they may be comparable to desktop applications, Java will not be perceived as being a player in this space without having a viable offering.  Perhaps the biggest jab on this one came from the w3c in their Widget Landscape report: &quot;3.2 Differences from Java Applets ... It is argued that the most notable difference between them is that widgets are easier for authors to create than Java applets. ... Applets are intended to run inside Web pages, while widgets as described in this document generally serve the purpose of stand-alone applications that run outside of a Web browser.&quot; WidgetFX directly addresses these issues through the JavaFX Script language, which simplifies authoring of widgets, and desktop integration features which set WidgetFX widgets apart from standard Java applets</p>

<p>It is a project dedicated to the Wiimote and Flash® applications consisting of two main parts: </p>

<p>WiiFlash Server WiiFlash ActionScript API DownloadingWe suggest you to use an SVN client like tortoiseSVN or subclipse (with FlexBuilder 2) to download the WiiFlash source code instad of using the featured wiiflash_api.zip. This way you stay always up-to-date. Since people have often problems with downloading from a repository we put the file up there for users that do not want to deal with SVN. If you like to use SVN and the help on Google Code is not enough for you there is also an article in the Papervision3D wiki about this issue. </p>

<p>APIWiiFlash is very easy to use. You can connect a Wiimote in Flash with three lines of code and start reading your data. </p>

<p>var wiimote: Wiimote = new Wiimote();

 summary : <p>Wiim (&#39;whim&#39; or &#39;wheem&#39;, if you prefer) is a simple set of C++ classes that allow you to connect to your Wii remote through Windows&#39; HID interface to send and receive commands. Right now you can receive button presses and motion data as well as set rumble and LED status. There&#39;s no support for IR or any extension devices yet.</p>
 title : The wiimote-spacial-locator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is part of a larger project to get &quot;proper&quot; head tracking into first person shooter.  Previously, head tracking software used the head tracking as a means of controlling where your avatar in the virtual world was facing but this feels wrong because when you turn your head to the left, you are no longer looking at your monitor.  If you were to have some kind of surround display, you would still not want the head tracking to do this because looking to the left would simply allow you to see the left monitor. </p>

<p>The correct immersive effect for a head tracking device is to allow the user to view the monitor as a window into another world, allowing them to look &quot;around the corner&quot; of the monitor.  In order to do this the the 3D application needs to use an asymmetric view frustum instead of the normal symmetric one. </p>

<p>The source code available here is for the: </p>

<p>Wii remote driver (the part that let&#39;s you use a Wii remote on your PC). The spacial locator (the part that figures out where in space the LED is relative to the camera). A small test application to test the use of these two things. </p>

<p>For the curious, I did get this working in HL2 as a mod but unfortunately the HL2 engine doesn&#39;t allow a fine enough level of control over the rendering system to implement an asymmetric view frustum.  Plus my 2 week Christmas vacation ended. :) </p>

<p>This code is not maintained anymore.  If you are interested in making changes send me an e-mail and I will add you to the members list.  My address is my username (listed on the right) plus @gmail.com.</p>

<p>Latest News:19/01/09: I&#39;m currently looking for a job :D I&#39;m too bored in my current job and i&#39;ll quit it at the beginning of next april. If some people could be interested by my programming skills i&#39;d be glad to hear about it! Even more if it is wiimote related ;) Please find my resume on the following link : http://www.easy-dj.com/CV/CV.zip. </p>

<p>18/01/09: A different news but an important one :D Thanks to Young-Jae i added in the download section the new libwiiuse.so for linux. He pointed out the fact that Ubuntu Intrepid (8.10) now uses libbluetooth version 3 instead of version 2. He recompiled it and made it available to everyone else. Greetings to him ! Download is here : http://wiiusej.googlecode.com/files/libwiiuse.zip </p>

<p>18/01/09: Happy new year everybody !!! Best wishes to all of you ! Some news about WiiuseJ. I haven&#39;t given up the project. No new release have been plan for the moment because the current version is working pretty well and no new features are in wiiuse. I haven&#39;t received too much complaints about wiiusej quality yet :D However i received two features requests for the next release : </p>

<p>Filter the mouse movement to make it smoother. Add the possibility to get the bluetooth address of the connected wiimote. Those requests are understandable and be sure that i will add it in the next release. But to be honest i won&#39;t do a release just for this because it is too much work for so few things :) Last news but not least. You may be wondering when will be the next release. None are planned because the current one support all wiiuse features and wiiuse hasn&#39;t evolved for a while. Fortunately the wiiuse project has recently gained a bit of activity and they are looking for a person to make the MAC version. Therefore WiiuseJ may become compatible with MAC. You can check on wiiuse site for more info about it and stay tuned on WiiuseJ :D </p>

<p>21/11/08: Hello, a small news to tell you that in the downloads section you can find the two libs needed for linux 64 Bit. Thank you to kristian for compiling it and providing it to the community. So if you are under linux 64 Bit, please do download the two libs (zip file containing libWiiuseJ.so and wiiuse.so) and replace it in WiiuseJ. The forum is still available if you have any issue. </p>

<p>Presentation:WiiuseJ is a java API to use wiimotes on your computer. This API is built on top of an excellent API called Wiiuse using JNI. </p>

<p>WiiuseJ intents to be a very simple, easy to use and lightweight java API for wiimotes. </p>

<p>Some of the great aspects of this API are : </p>

<p> The compatibility which is as large as Wiiuse&#39;s API compatibility  Cross-platform : Windows and linux (like Wiiuse)  Easy to use Features:You can use all almost all features of the Wiiuse C api for the Wiimote (not the expansions). Main features are : </p>

<p> Get accelerometer events on different forms (Orientation, GForce and raw Acceleration)  Get events from infrared Camera  Get button events  Make the wiimote vibrate  Set lights of each wiimotes  Get events from expansions  ... (see special function from wiiuse) </p>

<p>Java3D and WiiuseJ for mars visualization : http://videos.softmemo.com/v-BHK7fTOhk3A.html </p>

<p>Other Java API for wiimotes:Other java APIs for wiiimotes already exist : WiiremoteJ, motej and Wiimote simple. Those are full java APIs using jsr-082 specifications and compatibility is often not as good as this api. </p>

<p>Screenshot:Here is the test GUI launched: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This GUI permits you to test all the functionalities provided by WiiuseJ for each wiimote. </p>

<p>Requirements:All you need is a bluetooth receiver and a wiimote. </p>

<p>Next you need java 1.6. </p>

<p>Windows version has been tested with bluesoleil 2.3 stack. Wiiuse is supposed to work with almost every windows stack. Please let us some feedbacks in the discussion group to indicate which stack does work. Linux version has been tested also and works well. </p>

<p>Disclaimer:This API was made to have a simple working java API to use wiimotes. I had problems when i tried to use WiiremoteJ with my windows + bluesoleil laptop. Now i have everything i need to have some fun using a wiimote. Consequently i&#39;m not planning to implement a lot more features unless some people ask for it or people implement it themselves(this is an open source project!!!). </p>

<p>Older news:29/09/08:  Hello, just a small news to announce a new release of WiiUseJ : 0.12b. Since there is no new version of wiiuse this release is a minor one. It only fixes a bug happening when disconnecting several wiimotes and make wiiusej compatible with java 1.5. The compatibility with java 1.5 might need to recompile the .dll and .so, if it is the case let me know and i&#39;ll make it for you. Those fixes come for both from two users of wiiusej. Many thanks to jbrownbridge and Oskard for their help !!! The javadoc and the examples didn&#39;t change. </p>

<p>30/07/08:  Here is the new version of WiiuseJ. It adds the full support of the guitar hero 3 controller and the classic controller. It is always as easy to use as before. Feel free to leave any feedback on the forum, report bugs, ask for help or new features and please show us the projects you make using WiiuseJ. Now WiiuseJ almost fully supports wiiuse features. Only reading the wiimote memory is not ported to java(and i&#39;m not planning to implement it). Now i&#39;ll wait for the next wiiuse release !   </p>

<p>25/06/08:  I made the next version. The new features are just the guitar hero 3 and classic controller support. I&#39;ve been able to borrow the guitar and test it with the GUI, it works fine. Unfortunately i couldn&#39;t borrow a classic controller and i don&#39;t really want to buy it. Can someone test it and tell me where he sees bugs in the GUI ? http://groups.google.com/group/wiiusej-users/attach/b211eb11ff0424f8/wiiuse.zip?part=4 Could you give feedbacks in the following topic : http://groups.google.com/group/wiiusej-users/browse_thread/thread/2beb0329ee8fdcf0 </p>

<p>01/06/08:  I am still working on wiiusej and i recently programmed support for Guitar Hero 3 controller and Classic Controller. I haven&#39;t made the GUI yet and i can&#39;t test it because i don&#39;t have any of these extensions. Is there anyone who could test the DEV version of WiiuseJ with these extensions? Download it in the users discussion group : Topic building wiiusej.dll http://groups.google.com/group/wiiusej-users/attach/f31e9af1d6c78c3e/wiiuseJ_dev_version_controllers.zip?part=4. And please give feedbacks. </p>

<p>01/06/08: WiiuseJ 0.12 is out. Added nunchuk support !!!! It is now based on wiiuse 0.12 and plenty of other improvements !!! The main improvements are: </p>

<p>added nunchuk support, with separated thresholds configuration background architecture greatly improved(notably to andle easily different extensions) you can now sleep in event-handling method(it will delay wiimote polling) added ir_sensitivity functions added a method to set up timeouts fixed the Z coordinates on the IR Event you can now reconnect wiimotes during runtime possibility to force bluetooth stack detection project cleaned </p>

<p>25/05/08: Hello, all. Just a small news to make some excuses for the delay for this new version. I worked really a lot on it this week but i&#39;m still facing some small bugs and i don&#39;t like to release crappy things. Well, really i&#39;m sorry for the delay. It may take another week to release it and fix these issues. I may also release the new version with some known bugs, just to know if everybody are facing it on its configuration. Anyway, this version will have a lot of improvements behind the scene(it will help to implement the other extensions) and for the user (With at least the nunchuk support!).  </p>

<p>18/05/08: Just a small reminder to tell you that so far you need java 1.6 to use WiiuseJ. I may make it compatible with other java versions in a future release. </p>

<p>13/05/08: Here is a great news. WiiuseJ has been used for a demonstration at the javaone. More details here: http://ajaxian.com/archives/wii-darts-powering-ajax-applications-with-wii-controllers. Concerning the new version, i&#39;ve been working on it for a while now. I faced some problems with synchronization, that i finally bypassed. I got a working version, but i still have more tests to do and the GUI to update. For what i can tell you so far, the API has been cleaned and updated with latest enhancements of wiiuse and the major improvement for this release will be the nunchuk support !!! Stay tuned for the new release within the next two weeks ! </p>

<p>21/03/08: Here is the new version of WiiuseJ: v0.11. It is now compatible with linux thanks to plyd who compiled it. Another user asked me to change the api so that you can choose wether or not you make the wiimotes rumble the first time you connect to it. </p>

<p>14/03/08: I did a small documentation to make a small sample program we WiiuseJ. This sample program is downloadable, as a netbeans project, in the download section. Please let me know if you want more documentation or if you have any questions or features requests. You can reach me through the discussion group. </p>

<p>10/03/08: First release of WiiuseJ API. WiiuseJ 0.1. Currently only the windows version exists. The linux version will come soon (normally i just need to compile a C file under linux). Please leave some feedbacks on the user discussion group and help us to track bugs.</p>

 title : The wikid-two-factor-authentication Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Two-factor authentication from WiKIDThe WiKID Strong Authentication System is a public key-based two-factor authentication system. It is flexible, extensible, and secure alternative to tokens,certs &amp; passwords. Application support for Java, Windows, PHP, Ruby, Python, SugarCRM, webmail, OpenVPN, LDAP, TACACS+, etc.  Open source token clients include a J2SE client and a Firefox extension (in beta). </p>

<p>The token client encrypts the user&#39;s PIN with the WiKID server&#39;s public key and sends it to the server along with a one-time use AES key. If the PIN is correct, the account active and the encryption valid, the one-time password is generated (via java random), encrypted by the token client&#39;s public key and the AES key and returned.   </p>

<p>If the security domain is configured for https mutual authentication, a hash of the valid ssl cert and the URL are also sent with the OTP.  The token client will attempt to fetch the SSL cert from the URL and hash it.  If the hashes match, the URL is presented as valid and the default browser is launched to the valid website.  This prevents MITM attacks against web applications. </p>

 title : The wikimodel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Wiki ModelThis project contains a set of wiki-related libraries, such as a parsers for various wiki syntaxes, and common wiki model (event- and object-based). </p>

<p>WikiModel was developped within the the European project Nepomuk. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Projects goalsThe main goal of this project is creation of a “standard” model for wiki documents. It contains two different models: </p>

<p>Wiki Event Model (WEM) – like Simple API for XML (SAX) Wiki Object Model (WOM) – like Document Object Model for XML (DOM) End-user benefits/featuresGenerates well-formed XHTML and XML. And it is very persistent for user’s errors (not closed or overlapping markup elements…) Wiki pages can be stored in XML-form and converted into a well-formed wiki-syntax only for editing. So all source pages will be “autoformatted” – non closed markup elements will be explicitly closed, overlapping elements will be corrected and so on… Each page can have its own “subpages” (“documents”) and each page could be splitted into multiply zones (“document sections”). For more information – see “Documents” section. Each page or a subpage can contain the full formatting – block-level elements (like headers, tables, paragraphs) and inline elements (like links, style elements, special symbols). In-memory representation of all elements offers the possibility of in-memory transformations/refactoring of wiki pages and additional operations with them (like generation of tables of content, extranctions of all link/images and so on) Wiki-engins can cache all wiki-pages in memory in the form of objects. Each block element (paragraph, table cells, list items, headers…) can have multiply lines. Almost all structural elements can have its own parameters (block elements as well as inline elements). Providing toolsJavaCC-based parser for wiki-syntax. It generates events for Wiki Event Listeners. Usage of this parser garanties that even “bad-formed” wiki-pages will produce a “well-formed” sequence of events (all opening elements will be explicitly closed, all overlappings will be corrected) XHTML event listener producing well-formed XHTML XML event listener generating well formed XML documents (each structural wiki element is represented in the form of an xml element). The corresponding XML-deserialized (based on standard SAX parser) is also supplied. WomToWem and WemToWom transformers. They offer the possibility to transform sequence of events (WEM) into a in-memory tree of object (WOM) and vice versa. The reference implementation Wiki Object Model is also supplied. “Semantic Web compatibility”One of the most important issues is to be compatible with the main standard/datamodel of Semantic Web – with Resource Description Framework (RDF). It means that both models (WEM as well as WOM) offer the possibility to map elements from wiki pages to RDF-statements. So each wiki page can be considered as a node in an RDF-graph. It allows to transform wiki-tools into powerful yet simple Semantic Web applications.</p>

 summary : <p>If you have an iPhone 3G, or an iPhone/iPod Touch running iPhone OS 2.0, you want http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphoneThis page is only useful if you have a jailbroken iPhone OS 1.0 phone. </p>

<p>Store the sum of human knowledge on your iPhone/iPod Touch -- an offline copy of Wikipedia that requires no &#39;net access. </p>

<p>Intro: http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphone Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/wikipedia-iphone/topics WhatAn offline Wikipedia reader for the iPhone or iPod Touch. I wanted to write an iPhone app over Christmas, and so hacked this together during the break. </p>

<p>WhyIt&#39;s the warm fuzzy feeling of having the sum of all human knowledge in your pocket. It&#39;s the hitchhiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy realised. EDGE is slow; search is slow; you&#39;re abroad, in a plane, a tunnel, or on top of a mountain. You have an iPod Touch. </p>

<p>SizeIt&#39;ll consume about a quarter of your iPhone&#39;s storage—the app, indexes and dumps are almost exactly 2GB together. </p>

<p>CompletenesThis still has a lot of rough edges. Some articles can&#39;t be opened, and it&#39;s not too hard to crash the app. </p>

<p>OtherThere&#39;s also a mongrel-based ruby server for offline browsing on a PC (was used for debug during development). See sh/server in the source distribution. No screenshots yet. </p>

<p>Other peeps&quot;its sooooo awesome, my life is perfect now&quot; - rebelxtnut. &quot;IT WORKS!!!!! Search function, internal links to other articles, even search suggestions! This is awesome!&quot; - ryancx. &quot;Now this is serious shit!!! I installed it and it is working great. This is the most useful app to have besides a few dict apps.&quot; - a4pat.</p>
 summary : <p>This project is based on Epson&#39;s S1C33E07 processor with SDRAM, a serial EEPROM and a SD card slot attached. Along with UI input/output devices, of course. </p>

<p>The project&#39;s goal is to provide a bunch of software: </p>

<p>a set of bootloaders which load a small kernel image from SD card and execute it. wiki-lib, a library which contains all the application&#39;s logic gui-lib, a very thin layer to provide glyph rendering and font file parsing some simulators (Qt/Cocoa/ncurses) which emulate the hardware to make development easy the &#39;kernel&#39; code which is only a small wrapper around the hardware and uses wiki-lib and gui-lib host based tools to generate the content from Wikipedia sources (indexing, font file generation, ...) Toppers/JSP is included as source tree in a configuration that boots on the hardware. However, it is not currently used as base of our software stack.</p>

 title : The word-clj Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This is the example code for a series on Clojure and NLP that I&#39;m doing on my blog: http://writingcoding.blogspot.com/search/label/clojure-series </p>

<p>Quoting from my blog: </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the plan: 
<br/>- Its target audience will be people like myself: self-taught programmers whose primary education has been in the humanities. 
<br/>- This won&#39;t be a tutorial on how to program: The audience should have a little programming experience, preferably in Perl, Python, or Ruby. 
<br/>- But you won&#39;t need to have any experience in lisp, functional programming, or concurrent programming. I&#39;ll touch on those as we go along. 
<br/>- The problems I&#39;m going to tackle will be oriented to processing text documents and analyzing the language in them. The techniques I&#39;ll cover will be helpful to those interested in stylistics and other literary studies, or to those interested in corpus linguistics. 
<br/>- Many of the things I&#39;ll describe—such as tokenization–will be very basic and far back from the cutting-edge.  Since this is also an introduction to Clojure, I&#39;ll cover the basics also. 
<br/>- But there will also be some odd gaps. For example, I&#39;ll explain regular expressions just enough to implement tokenization. Then I&#39;ll point you to one of the myriad-thousand excellent online tutorials if you want to learn more about them. 
<br/>- Since one of the main points of Clojure is concurrency and parallel processing, I&#39;ll cover that also. 
<br/>- The examples will build on each other, and in the end, we&#39;ll have a system for doing parallel processing of text documents. We&#39;ll build a variety of tasks to do some standard analyses, and we&#39;ll design it so creating more tasks and inserting them into the processing stream will be relatively easy. 
<br/>This code project will act as both a place to keep the sample code that I create for that series and the basis for a the NLP library. </p>

With a WOV package (wrapper of video) the original file and a QuickTime reference movie representing the fully index file are stored together so that apps that support native QuickTime movies can open files near instantaneously, while retaining the ability to open the original file in Non-QuickTime apps, rebuild the reference movie when the plugins change, and support QuickLook all wrapped in one convenient document icon.  </p>

<p>WOV Suite contains: </p>

<p>WOV Opener: that opens a WOV package in any application that supports QuickTime natively or the Original Wrapped file. </p>

<p>WOV Converter: that converts non MOV files supported by a QuickTime import plugin into WOV packages. </p>

<p>WrapperOfVideo.framework: makes it easy for other cocoa applications to support WOV packages without WOV opener.</p>
 title : The wow-clique Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Clique is a very simple, yet very powerful tool. It provides a solid interface for configuring click-casting on any set of frames that has a plugin written for it. What is click casting?</p>

<p>Click casting was a concept initially written for WoW in the form of Castparty by Danboo. It allowed the user to assign spells and functions to the differently clicks on the Castparty frame. What this means is when you pressed Shift+Left click on a Castparty frame, the mod cast whatever spell you had assigned to it on that unit.</p>

<p>Clique brings click-casting to any unit frame that registers for it, with a very simple configuration interface.  Simply open your spellbook, and click on the new tab to configure your click-casting.</p>

 summary : <p>JMacro 宏插件宏插件。 进游戏，输入 /m， 可以看到，在宏里面多了几个宏 “术、食、绷、红、蓝” ， 把他们拖到技能条上。 术 就是术士专用的宏了。他总是能够提示你最需要的技能，比如，绑灵魂石，造石头，给宝宝加血，生命分流，甚至在游泳的时候会提示你用魔息术。实在没事干，它就会变成召唤坐骑。 如果你的宝宝没有召唤，或者挂了，它就会变成召唤宠物的技能，用 alt, shift, ctrl, alt+shift 可以切换宝宝。 不过这些都是在非战斗状态下，在战斗状态下，则会变成吸取灵魂，alt 吸取生命，shift 吸取法力。 我建议把它放在一个醒目的位置，并给一个非常方便的快捷键，因为它将经常用到，我用的是Q键。 </p>

<p>食 就是食物与饮料，同时喝的。 当你背包中的食物变化了，或者刚跟法师要了些水，要重新拖到技能条上，太麻烦了。 </p>

<p>红、蓝、绷 同样是可以解决物品频繁变化的问题。 注意绷带左键是治疗目标或宠物，最后是自己，右键必定是治疗自己。 </p>

 title : The wowcatsim Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Cat DPS Simulator for the World of Warcraft MMORPG, WOTLK expansion. This simulator allows users to determine approximate DPS done by a feral druid in cat form, depending on many possible input parameters such as the statistics of the cat (ability scores and talents) as well as the fight strategy. </p>

<p>StrategiesThe primary purpose of the Cat DPS Simulator is to determine the best cat fighting strategy. For this purpose, the strategy used can be customized by the user with a little programming knowledge. Hopefully, with the help of the Feral Druid community we can keep improving the strategy to use. Please see the guide on WritingStrategies. </p>

<p>TipsIf you see a missing build like for example there is no 2.4.3.8606, this is normal, this is because build 8606 has no changes compared to the previous one 8600, so the build 8606 = 8600 and so on 2.4.3.8606 = 0.4.3.8600 and this last is present on the site. Any missing build you could notice follows the same rule. </p>

 summary : <p>WoWFront is a web frontend for the MaNGOS MMORPG server, featuring a frontend for the users, as well as an administration panel with lots of features for the administrators and game masters. </p>

<p>The project is being run by the GamerzWoW World of Warcraft private server, the official WoW server of the GamerzPlanet gaming community. </p>

<p>The project is aiming to replicate the functions of the official Blizzard webpage, but not the layout. We&#39;re aiming to use our own layout instead. Furthermore, layout can be easily customized, as the frontend uses the Smarty template engine. </p>

<p>NOTE: WoWFront has been closed due to the developer (XTZGZoReX) not having time for it. If you want to continue WoWFront, however, you can contact him on the GamerzWoW forums.</p>
